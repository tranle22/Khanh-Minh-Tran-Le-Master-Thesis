Business. ##TABLE_END General The company was originally organized as Caterpillar Tractor Co. in 1925 in the State of California. In 1986, the company reorganized as Caterpillar Inc. in the State of Delaware. As used herein, the term Caterpillar, we, us, our, or the company refers to Caterpillar Inc. and its subsidiaries unless designated or identified otherwise. Principal Lines of Business / Nature of Operations We operate in three principal lines of business: ##TABLE_START 1. Machinery  A principal line of business which includes the design, manufacture, marketing and sales of construction, mining and forestry machinerytrack and wheel tractors, track and wheel loaders, pipelayers, motor graders, wheel tractor-scrapers, track and wheel excavators, backhoe loaders, log skidders, log loaders, off-highway trucks, articulated trucks, paving products, skid steer loaders, underground mining equipment, tunnel boring equipment and related parts. Also includes logistics services for other companies and the design, manufacture, remanufacture, maintenance and services of rail-related products. 2. Engines  A principal line of business including the design, manufacture, marketing and sales of engines for Caterpillar machinery, electric power generation systems, locomotives, marine, petroleum, construction, industrial, agricultural and other applications and related parts. Also includes remanufacturing of Caterpillar engines and a variety of Caterpillar machine and engine components and remanufacturing services for other companies. Reciprocating engines meet power needs ranging from 10 to 21,800 horsepower (8 to over 16 000 kilowatts). Turbines range from 1,600 to 30,000 horsepower (1 200 to 22 000 kilowatts). 3. Financial Products  A principal line of business consisting primarily of Caterpillar Financial Services Corporation (Cat Financial), Caterpillar Insurance Holdings, Inc. (Cat Insurance) and their respective subsidiaries. Cat Financial provides a wide range of financing alternatives to customers and dealers for Caterpillar machinery and engines, Solar gas turbines as well as other equipment and marine vessels. Cat Financial also extends loans to customers and dealers. Cat Insurance provides various forms of insurance to customers and dealers to help support the purchase and lease of our equipment. ##TABLE_END Due to financial information required by accounting guidance on segment reporting , we have also divided our business into 11 reportable segments for financial reporting purposes. Information about our reportable segments, including geographic information, appears in Note 24  Segment information  of Exhibit 13. Other information about our operations in 2009 and our outlook for 2010, including certain risks associated with foreign operations, is incorporated by reference from Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations of Exhibit 13. Company Strengths Caterpillar is the leader in construction and mining equipment, and diesel and natural gas engines and industrial gas turbines in our size range. The company is also a leading services provider through Cat Financial, Caterpillar Logistics Services Inc. (Cat Logistics), Caterpillar Remanufacturing Services and Progress Rail Services Corporation (Progress Rail). Annual sales and revenues were $32.396 billion in 2009, making Caterpillar the largest manufacturer in its industry. Caterpillar is also a leading U.S. exporter. Through direct sales of certain products and a global network of independent dealers, Caterpillar builds long-term relationships with customers around the world. For almost 85 years, the Caterpillar name has been associated with the highest level of quality products and services. More information is available at www.CAT.com. Page 1   Competitive Environment Caterpillar products and product support services are sold worldwide into a variety of highly competitive markets. In all markets, we compete on the basis of product performance, customer service, quality and price. From time to time, the intensity of competition results in price discounting in a particular industry or region. Such price discounting puts pressure on margins and can negatively impact operating profit. Outside of the United States, certain competitors enjoy competitive advantages inherent to operating in their home countries or regions. ##TABLE_START  Machinery ##TABLE_END The competitive environment for Caterpillars machinery business consists of some global competitors and many regional and specialized local competitors. Examples of global competitors include, but are not limited to, Komatsu Ltd., Volvo Construction Equipment (part of the Volvo Group AB), CNH Global N.V., Deere  Co., Hitachi Construction Machinery Co., Terex Corporation, J.C. Bamford Ltd. (JCB) and Doosan Infracore Co., Ltd. Each of these companies have varying numbers of product lines that compete with Caterpillar products and each have varying degrees of regional focus. John Deere Construction and Forestry Division (part of Deere  Co.), for example, has numerous product lines that compete with Caterpillar primarily in North America and Latin America. Others, like JCB, offer a limited range of products that compete globally against Caterpillar. The world economy experienced its worst postwar recession in 2009, causing construction spending to decline in many countries and mining companies to reduce production. End users significantly reduced purchases of equipment and dealers reduced their reported inventories by over $3.3 billion. As a result, machinery sales volume declined at an unprecedented rate. Governments responded with large infrastructure programs and central banks reduced interest rates to record lows. As a result, the world economy began recovering in the third quarter of 2009 and the year-on-year decline in sales volume in the fourth quarter was less than in the prior two quarters. Caterpillars logistics business provides integrated supply chain services for Caterpillar and 50 other companies worldwide. It competes with global, regional and local competitors, including companies such as DHL International, CEVA and United Parcel Service, Inc. The unit has grown signifcantly since its inception in 1987. Since its acquisition by Caterpillar in June 2006, wholly owned subsidiary Progress Rail has continued its position in North America as a leading provider of a broad range of products. Based in Albertville, Alabama, Progress Rail is a leading provider of remanufactured locomotive, railcar and track products and services to the North American railroad industry. The company also has one of the most extensive rail service and supply networks in North America. Expansion into the railroad aftermarket business is a good fit with our strategic direction and leverages Caterpillars global remanufacturing capabilities. ##TABLE_START  Engines ##TABLE_END Caterpillar operates in a very competitive engine/turbine manufacturing and packaging environment. The company designs, manufactures, markets and sells diesel, heavy fuel and natural gas reciprocating engines for Caterpillar machinery, electric power generation systems, locomotives, marine, petroleum, construction, industrial, agricultural and other applications. In addition, Caterpillar provides industrial turbines and turbine related services for oil and gas and power generation applications. Page 2 The competitive environment for reciprocating engines in marine, petroleum, construction, industrial, agriculture and electric power generation systems along with turbines consists of a few global competitors who compete in a variety of markets that Caterpillar serves, and a larger set of companies who compete in a limited size range and/or application. Principal global competitors include, but are not limited to, Cummins Inc., MTU Friedrichshafen and MTU Detroit Diesel (both are Tognum Group companies), GE Energy Infrastructure, Siemens Energy and Wartsila Corp. Other competitors, such as John Deere Power Systems, MAN Diesel SE, MAN Turbo, Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Ltd., Volvo Penta (part of Volvo Group AB), Kawasaki Heavy Industries and Rolls Royce Group plc compete in certain markets in which Caterpillar competes. An additional set of competitors, including Generac Power Systems, Inc., Kohler Co., and others, are packagers who source engines and/or other components from domestic and international suppliers and market products regionally and internationally through a variety of distribution channels. As previously announced, Caterpillar no longer provides new engines to truck and other on-highway original equipment manufacturers (OEMs). Caterpillar will continue to service our previous on-highway engine customers through Caterpillar and truck OEM dealer channels. Since the introduction of Caterpillars ACERT Technology in 2003, Caterpillar has continued to focus investment and resources on leveraging this technology. The building blocks for ACERT Technology are flexible and scalable and are being applied as needed based on engine platform and application. Caterpillar will add several new technologies to our portfolio of ACERT Technologies to meet upcoming Tier 4 Interim/Stage IIIB non-road emissions regulations. We believe ACERT provides Caterpillar with a valuable foundation to meet emissions and performance requirements. Caterpillars remanufacturing business provides services for a variety of products and services to Caterpillar and other external clients. The remanufacturing business competes on a regional basis with similarly sized or smaller companies. The company launched the remanufacturing business in the 1970s with engines/turbines and is now one of the worlds largest remanufacturers, processing more than two million units annually and recycling more than 140 million pounds of remanufactured products each year. The business continues to grow at rates well above that of the global economy as a whole. ##TABLE_START  Financial Products ##TABLE_END  Our financial products business is primarily conducted by Cat Financial. Cat Financial, incorporated in Delaware, is a wholly owned finance subsidiary of Caterpillar. Cat Financials primary business is to provide retail and wholesale financing alternatives for Caterpillar products to customers around the world. Retail financing is primarily comprised of financing of Caterpillar equipment, machinery and engines. In addition, Cat Financial also provides financing for vehicles, power generation facilities and marine vessels that, in most cases, incorporate Caterpillar products. In addition to retail financing, Cat Financial provides wholesale financing to Caterpillar dealers and purchases short-term dealer receivables from Caterpillar and its subsidiaries. The various financing plans offered by Cat Financial are designed to increase the opportunity for sales of Caterpillar products and generate financing income for Cat Financial. A significant portion of Cat Financials activities is conducted in North America. However, Cat Financial has additional offices and subsidiaries in Asia, Australia, Europe and Latin America. For over 25 years, Cat Financial has been providing financing in the various markets in which it participates, contributing to its knowledge of asset values, industry trends, product structuring and customer needs. In certain instances, Cat Financials operations are subject to supervision and regulation by state, federal and various foreign governmental authorities, and may be subject to various laws and judicial and administrative decisions imposing requirements and restrictions which, among other things, (i) regulate credit granting activities and the administration of loans, (ii) establish maximum interest rates, finance charges and other charges, (iii) require disclosures to customers and investors, (iv) govern secured transactions, (v) set collection, foreclosure, repossession and other trade practices and (vi) regulate the use and reporting of information related to a borrowers credit experience. Cat Financials ability to comply with these governmental and legal requirements and restrictions affects its operations. Cat Financials retail leases and installment sale contracts (totaling 60 percent*) include: ##TABLE_START   Tax leases that are classified as either operating or finance leases for financial accounting purposes, depending on the characteristics of the lease. For tax purposes, Cat Financial is considered the owner of the equipment (18 percent*). ##TABLE_END Page 3 ##TABLE_START   Finance (non-tax) leases, where the lessee for tax purposes is considered to be the owner of the equipment during the term of the lease, that either require or allow the customer to purchase the equipment for a fixed price at the end of the term (22 percent*). ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START   Installment sale contracts, which are equipment loans that enable customers to purchase equipment with a down payment or trade-in and structure payments over time (19 percent*). ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START   Governmental lease-purchase plans in the U.S. that offer low interest rates and flexible terms to qualified non-federal government agencies (1 percent*). ##TABLE_END Cat Financials wholesale notes receivable, finance leases and installment sale contracts (totaling 8 percent*) include: ##TABLE_START   Inventory/rental programs, which provide assistance to dealers by financing their new Caterpillar inventory and rental fleets (4 percent*). ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START   Short-term dealer receivables we purchase from Caterpillar at a discount (4 percent*). ##TABLE_END Cat Financials retail notes receivables (32 percent*) include: ##TABLE_START   Loans that allow customers and dealers to use their Caterpillar equipment as collateral to obtain financing. ##TABLE_END The retail financing business is highly competitive, with financing for users of Caterpillar equipment available through a variety of sources, principally commercial banks and finance and leasing companies. Cat Financials competitors include Wells Fargo Equipment Finance Inc., General Electric Capital Corporation and various local banks and finance companies. In addition, many of our manufacturing competitors own financial subsidiaries such as Volvo Financial Services, Komatsu Financial L.P. and John Deere Credit Corporation that utilize below-market interest rate programs (subsidized by the manufacturer) to assist machine sales. Caterpillar and Cat Financial work together to provide a broad array of financial merchandising programs around the world to meet these competitive offers. Cat Financials financial results are largely dependent upon the ability of Caterpillar dealers to sell equipment and customers willingness to enter into financing or leasing agreements. It is also affected by, among other things, the availability of funds from its financing sources, general economic conditions such as inflation and market interest rates and its cost of funds relative to its competitors. Cat Financial has a match funding policy that addresses interest rate risk by aligning the interest rate profile (fixed rate or floating rate) of its debt portfolio with the interest rate profile of its receivables portfolio (loans and leases with customers and dealers) within predetermined ranges on an ongoing basis. In connection with that policy, Cat Financial issues debt with a similar interest rate profile to its receivables, and also uses interest rate swap agreements to manage its interest rate risk exposure to interest rate changes and in some cases to lower its cost of borrowed funds. For more information regarding match funding, please see Note 3 Derivative financial instruments and risk management of Exhibit 13. See also the risk factor titled Risks to Financial Products Line of Business for general risk associated with our financial products business included in Item 1A. of this Form 10-K. In managing foreign currency risk for Cat Financials operations, the objective is to minimize earnings volatility resulting from conversion and the remeasurement of net foreign currency balance sheet positions. This policy allows the use of foreign currency forward and option contracts to address the risk of currency mismatch between the receivable and debt portfolios. None of these foreign currency forward and option contracts are designated as a hedge. __________ *Indicates the percentage of Cat Financials total portfolio at December 31, 2009. We define total portfolio as total finance receivables (net of unearned income and allowance for credit losses) plus equipment on operating leases, less accumulated depreciation. For more information on the above and Cat Financials concentration of credit risk, please refer to Note 8  Finance receivables of Exhibit 13. Page 4 Cat Financial provides financing only when certain criteria are met. Credit decisions are based on, among other factors, the customers credit history, financial strength and equipment application. Cat Financial typically maintains a security interest in retail-financed equipment and requires physical damage insurance coverage on financed equipment. Cat Financial finances a significant portion of Caterpillar dealers sales and inventory of Caterpillar equipment throughout the world. Cat Financials competitive position is improved by marketing programs offered in conjunction with Caterpillar and/or Caterpillar dealers. Under these programs, Caterpillar, or the dealer, subsidizes an amount at the outset of the transaction, which Cat Financial then recognizes as revenue over the term of the financing. These marketing programs provide Cat Financial with a significant competitive advantage in financing Caterpillar products. Transaction processing time and supporting technologies continue to drive Cat Financial in its efforts to respond quickly to customers and improve internal processing efficiencies. We believe Cat Financials web-based Cat Financ Express SM transaction processing and information tool currently available in the United States, France, Canada and Australia provides Cat Financial a competitive advantage in those areas. Cat Financ Express SM is a web-based tool that provides finance quotes, credit decisions and the ability to print the appropriate financial documents for end-user signature, all within a reasonably short time frame.

The continuing global economic crisis and the volatility in the credit and capital markets had a significant impact on our 2009 sales and revenues and profitability. Overall, the companys sales and revenues decreased 37 percent from 2008, and profit in 2009 was down 75 percent from 2008. In response to the on-going recession in 2009, we continued executing our trough plans, which we had commenced implementing in 2008, and taking other actions to deal with the effects of the recession and to reduce costs. These actions resulted in full-year redundancy costs of $0.75 per share. In addition, we focused on maintaining solid profitability and cash flow and improving our balance sheet. These efforts contributed to our ability to maintain our credit ratings, maintain our dividend rate, make pension contributions and continue selective investment in new products and capacity. During the second half of 2009, market conditions in developing economies showed signs of improvement; the more developed economies also showed signs of improvement but at a slower pace. Many countries responded to the recession by adopting various forms of economic stimulus packages, including allocations for infrastructure spending, a positive factor for sales of our Machinery and Engines. However, the economic recovery remained uneven at the end of 2009 and beginning of 2010. Financial Results and Stockholder Value Full year 2009 results marked a significant decline in sales and revenues and profit for Caterpillar. The company realized 2009 sales and revenues of $32.396 billion and profit of $895 million. Our profit per share in 2009 was $1.43 including redundancy costs of $0.75 per share. In spite of the severe economic conditions, we improved our balance sheet and maintained our dividend rate. The company has not resumed its stock repurchase program since temporarily suspending it on January 26, 2009. Sustainability In 2009, the company continued its efforts in sustainable development and its commitment to make sustainable development a strategic area of improvement in our enterprise strategy. The company was selected as a member of the Dow Jones Sustainability World Index (DJSI World) for the ninth consecutive year and has retained its Sustainable Asset Management (SAM) Gold Class position in the Industrial Engineering sector. DJSI World uses a best-in-class approach designed to identify best practices across the economic, social and environmental dimensions of corporate sustainability. Caterpillar Production System (CPS) We have continued our focus on deploying CPS with 6 Sigma. Through the implementation of CPS, we have made continued progress on our safety and quality goals, reduced inventory and improved cost performance. CPS continues to be a fundamental component to help us achieve our near-term goals and our Vision 2020. Growth Initiatives In 2009, the company made selective investments in growth and expansion opportunities as we focused on positioning ourselves for economic recovery. In spite of the challenging economic conditions, we made progress toward our g oals of expanding our business in the Peoples Republic of China  (PRC) and other emerging markets and moving towards achieving market leadership positions. In support of our overall enterprise strategy and Vision 2020, Caterpillar took the following actions during 2009: ##TABLE_START   In September 2009, Caterpillar and Navistar International Corporation (Navistar) finalized a joint venture transaction resulting in a new company, NC 2 Global LLC (NC 2 ). Plans to form the 50/50 joint venture were first announced in June 2008. NC 2 will develop, manufacture, market, distribute and provide product support for on-highway medium- and heavy-duty commercial trucks outside of North America, the Indian subcontinent, Myanmar (Burma) and Malaysia. Initially, NC 2 will focus its activities in Australia, Brazil, PRC, Russia, South Africa and Turkey. NC 2 s product line will feature both conventional and cab-over truck designs and will be sold under both the Caterpillar and International (Navistar) brands. ##TABLE_END Page 6 ##TABLE_START   In September 2009, NC 2 and Anhui Jianghuai Automobile Co. Ltd. (Jianghuai) signed a framework agreement to potentially establish a joint venture in the PRC that would develop, manufacture and sell trucks and truck parts primarily in the PRC and certain export markets. Jianghuai is a manufacturer of automobiles and trucks and related parts based in Anhui Province, PRC. The framework agreement contemplates finalizing a joint venture by mid-2010. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START   In November 2009, Caterpillar entered into an agreement to acquire JCS Co. Ltd. (JCS), a subsidiary of Jinsung T.E.C. Co., Ltd., a South Korea-based manufacturer that specializes in producing undercarriage components for earthmoving and other off-road machinery. The acquisition of JCS will provide Caterpillar proprietary technology to produce engineered seals for undercarriages. The JCS manufacturing facility is the first factory for Caterpillar in South Korea. The acquisition, subject to regulatory approval, is expected to be finalized in early 2010. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START   In December 2009, Caterpillar opened the Wuxi multi-functional research and development center in Wuxi, located in Jiangsu Province, PRC. The facility was announced in August 2008 to increase technical support for products serving markets in the PRC and the rest of the Asia Pacific Region. The Wuxi facility also performs engine and component product and process development, validation, localization and technological training. Among its many functions, the new facility will have an engine test facility with performance and emissions development capability, an advanced materials laboratory, an electronics laboratory, a system and machine integration facility and validation capability. The Wuxi facility is strategically located near Caterpillars component manufacturing facility and its engine campus. It is also near the medium wheel loader and motor grader manufacturing facility in Suzhou, PRC. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START   In December 2009, Caterpillar signed a joint venture agreement with China Yuchai Machinery Co. Ltd. through its main operating subsidiary, Guangxi Yuchai Machinery Co. Ltd. (Yuchai) to establish a company to provide remanufacturing services for Yuchai diesel engines and components and certain Caterpillar diesel engines and components. The new company will provide remanufactured engines and components to customers worldwide. Yuchai is a key diesel engine manufacturer and the largest producer of internal combustion engines in the PRC. Its engine product line family includes mini, light, medium and heavy-duty engines for the truck, commercial bus, generator and passenger car markets. This joint venture, once approved by the applicable regulatory authority, will be the first remanufacturing joint venture for Caterpillar in the PRC. ##TABLE_END Other 2009 Developments ##TABLE_START   In December 2009, Caterpillar, through its wholly owned subsidiary Cat Logistics, announced plans to open a new parts distribution center in Clayton, Ohio. The new facility will extend more than 1,000,000 square feet and is part of the multi-year expansion and enhancement of the North American Cat Parts distribution network. The new facility will provide inbound receiving capability close to suppliers and align outbound shipments to improve delivery to dealers and customers. It is expected to be fully operational in 2011 and is expected to employ 500 to 600 people. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START   In June 2008, Caterpillar announced a multi-year $1 billion capacity expansion for key facilities in Illinois and other areas. This included planned investments of more than $1 billion from 2008 through 2010 in five of our existing facilities in Illinois (East Peoria, Joliet, Decatur, Aurora and Mossville). Through 2009, we have invested about two-thirds of this planned $1 billion in those five facilities. In addition, during this period we have also made significant capital investments at other Illinois facilities. ##TABLE_END Business Combinations Information related to acquisitions and alliances appears in Note 25  Business combinations and alliances  of Exhibit 13. Page 7  Raw Materials and Component Products We source our raw materials and manufactured components from leading suppliers both domestically and internationally. These purchases include unformed materials, rough and finished parts. Unformed materials include a variety of steel products which are then cut or formed to shape and machined in our facilities. Rough parts include various sized steel and iron castings and forgings which are machined to final specification levels inside our facilities. Finished parts are ready to assemble components which are made to either Caterpillar specifications or to the supplier developed specifications. We machine and assemble some of the components used in our machines, engines and power generation units and to support our after-market dealer parts sales. We also purchase various goods and services used in production, logistics, offices and product development processes. We maintain global strategic sourcing models to meet our global facilities production needs while building long-term supplier relationships and leveraging enterprise spend. We expect our suppliers to maintain, at all times, industry-leading levels of quality and the ability to timely deliver raw materials and component products for our machine and engine products. We use a variety of agreements with suppliers to protect our intellectual property and processes to monitor and mitigate risks of the supply base causing a business disruption. The risks monitored include supplier financial viability, the ability to increase or decrease production levels, business continuity, quality and delivery. Order Backlog Much of our backlog is in large engines, gas turbines and mining products. The dollar amount of backlog believed to be firm was approximately $9.6 billion at December 31, 2009, $14.7 billion at December 31, 2008 and $17.8 billion at December 31, 2007. Of the total backlog, approximately $2.5 billion at December 31, 2009, $2.2 billion at December 31, 2008 and $2.5 billion at December 31, 2007, was not expected to be filled in the following year. The decrease during 2009 reflects the impact of weak global economic conditions and our decision, beginning in late 2008 and continuing through 2009, to allow dealers to cancel orders. Our backlog is generally highest in the first and second quarters because of seasonal buying trends in our industry. Dealers Our machines are distributed principally through a worldwide organization of dealers (dealer network ), 51 located in the United States and 127 located outside the United States, serving 182 countries and operating 3,518 places of business, including dealer rental outlets. Reciprocating engines are sold principally through the dealer network and to other manufacturers for use in their products. Some of the reciprocating engines manufactured by Perkins Engines Company Limited (Perkins) are also sold through its worldwide network of 129 distributors located in 165 countries. Most of the electric power generation systems manufactured by F.G. Wilson Engineering Limited (FG Wilson) are sold through its worldwide network of 157 dealers located in 180 countries. Some of the large, medium speed reciprocating engines are also sold under the MaK brand through a worldwide network of 19 dealers located in 130 countries. Our dealers do not deal exclusively with our products; however, in most cases sales and servicing of our products are the dealers principal business. Turbines are sold through sales forces employed by the company. At times, these employees are assisted by independent sales representatives. The companys relationship with each of its independent dealers is memorialized in a standard sales and service agreement. Pursuant to this agreement, the company grants the dealer the right to purchase and sell its products and to service the products in a specified geographic service territory. Prices to dealers are established by the company after receiving input from dealers on transactional pricing in the marketplace. The company also agrees to defend its intellectual property and to provide warranty and technical support to the dealer. The agreement further grants the dealer a non-exclusive license to use the companys trademarks, service marks and brand names. In some instances a separate trademark agreement exists between the company and a dealer. In exchange for these rights, the agreement obligates the dealer to develop and promote the sale of the companys products to current and prospective customers in the dealers service territory. Each dealer specifically agrees to employ adequate sales and support personnel to market, sell and promote the companys products, demonstrate and exhibit the products, perform the companys product improvement programs, inform the company concerning any features that might affect the safe operation of any of the companys products and maintain detailed books and records of the dealers financial condition, sales and inventories and make these books and records available at the companys reasonable request. Page 8  These sales and service agreements are terminable at will by either party upon 90 days written notice and provide for termination automatically if the dealer files for bankruptcy protection or upon the occurrence of comparable action seeking protection from creditors.  Patents and Trademarks Our products are sold primarily under the brands Caterpillar, CAT, design versions of CAT and Caterpillar, Solar Turbines, MaK, Perkins, FG Wilson, Olympian and Progress Rail. We own a number of patents and trademarks, which have been obtained over a period of years and relate to the products we manufacture and the services we provide. These patents and trademarks have been of value in the growth of our business and may continue to be of value in the future. We do not regard any of our business as being dependent upon any single patent or group of patents. Research and Development We have always placed strong emphasis on product-oriented research and development relating to the development of new or improved machines, engines and major components. In 2009, 2008 and 2007, we spent $1,421 million, $1,728 million and $1,404 million, or 4.4 percent, 3.4 percent and 3.1 percent of our sales and revenues, respectively, on our research and development programs. RD expense is expected to increase about 20 percent in 2010, primarily to support product development programs related to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Tier 4 emissions requirements. Employment As of December 31, 2009, we employed 93,813 persons of whom 50,562 were located outside the United States. From a global enterprise perspective, we believe our relationship with our employees is very good. We build and maintain a productive, motivated workforce by striving to treat all employees fairly and equitably. In the United States, most of our 43,251 employees are at-will employees and, therefore, not subject to any type of employment contract or agreement. At select business units, certain highly specialized employees have been hired under employment contracts that specify a term of employment and specify pay and other benefits. As of December 31, 2009, there were 9,728 U.S. hourly production employees who were covered by collective bargaining agreements with various labor unions. The United Automobile, Aerospace and Agricultural Implement Workers of America represents 7,570 Caterpillar employees under a six-year central labor agreement that will expire March 1, 2011. The International Association of Machinists represents 1,627 employees under labor agreements that expire on May 23, 2010 and April 30, 2012. Outside the United States, the company enters into employment contracts and agreements in those countries in which such relationships are mandatory or customary. The provisions of these agreements correspond in each case with the required or customary terms in the subject jurisdiction. Sales Sales outside the United States were 69 percent of consolidated sales for 2009, 67 percent for 2008 and 63 percent for 2007. Environmental Matters The company is regulated by federal, state and international environmental laws governing our use, transport and disposal of substances and control of emissions. In addition to governing our manufacturing and other operations, these laws often impact the development of our products, including, but not limited to, required compliance with air emissions standards applicable to internal combustion engines. Compliance with these existing laws has not had a material impact on our capital expenditures, earnings or global competitive position. We are engaged in remedial activities at a number of locations, often with other companies, pursuant to federal and state laws. When it is reasonably probable we will pay remedial costs at a site, and those costs can be reasonably estimated, the costs are charged against our earnings. In formulating that estimate, we do not consider amounts expected to be recovered from insurance companies or others. The amount recorded for environmental remediation is not material and is included in the line item Accrued expenses in Statement 2  Consolidated Financial Position at December 31 of Exhibit 13. Page 9 We cannot reasonably estimate costs at sites in the very early stages of remediation. Currently, we have a few sites in the very early stages of remediation, and there is no more than a remote chance that a material amount for remedial activities at any individual site, or at all sites in the aggregate, will be required.

Risk Factors. ##TABLE_END The statements in this section describe the most significant risks to our business and should be considered carefully in conjunction with Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements of Exhibit 13 to this Form 10-K. In addition, these statements constitute our cautionary statements under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. The discussion and analysis contained in the Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and other items in this Form 10-K is forward-looking and involves uncertainties that could significantly impact results. From time to time, we also provide forward-looking statements in other materials we issue to the public or in the form of oral presentations to the public. Forward-looking statements give current expectations or forecasts of future events about the company. You can identify these statements by the fact they do not relate to historical or current facts and by the use of words such as believe, expect, estimate, anticipate, will be, should, plan, project, intend, could and similar words or expressions that identify forward-looking statements made on behalf of Caterpillar. In particular, these forward-looking statements include statements relating to future actions, prospective products, products approvals, future performance or results of current and anticipated products, sales efforts, expenses, interest rates, foreign exchange rates, the outcome of contingencies, economic conditions, potential returns, financial condition and financial results. The statements are based on assumptions or on known or unknown risks and uncertainties. Although we believe we have been prudent in our assumptions, we cannot guarantee the realization of these statements. Achievement of future results is subject to risks, uncertainties and potentially inaccurate assumptions. Should known or unknown risks or uncertainties materialize or underlying assumptions prove inaccurate, actual results could materially differ from past results and/or those anticipated, estimated or projected. Uncertainties include factors that affect international businesses, as well as matters specific to the company and the markets it serves. Page 10 The company undertakes no obligation to publicly update forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. You may, however, consult any future related disclosures we make on our Form 10-Q or any Form 8-K report to the SEC. The following is a cautionary discussion of risks, uncertainties and assumptions that we believe are significant to our business. These are factors that, individually or in the aggregate, we believe could make our actual results differ materially from expected or past results. You should note it is impossible to predict or identify all such factors and, as a result, you should not consider the following factors to be a complete discussion of risks and uncertainties. Economic Volatility, Global Economic Conditions and the Economic Conditions of Industries or Markets We Serve Our results of operations are materially affected by the conditions in the global economy generally and various capital markets. Global economic conditions may cause volatility and disruptions in the capital and credit markets. In some cases, the markets have decreased availability of liquidity, credit and credit capacity for certain issuers, customers, dealers and suppliers. Although we generally generate funds from our operations to pay our operating expenses, fund our capital expenditures, buy back stock, pay dividends and fund our employee retirement benefit programs, continuing to meet these cash requirements over the long-term will require substantial liquidity and access to sources of funds, including capital and credit markets. Changes in global economic conditions, including material cost increases and decreases in economic activity in many of the markets that we serve, and the success of plans to manage cost increases, inventory and other important elements of our business may significantly impact our ability to generate funds from operations. Market volatility, changes in counterparty credit risk, the impact of government intervention in financial markets and general economic conditions may also adversely impact the ability of the company to access capital and credit markets to fund operating needs. Inability to access capital and credit markets may have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and competitive position. The energy and mining industries are major users of our machines and engines. Decisions to purchase our machines and engines are dependent upon performance of these industries. If demand or output in these industries increases, the demand for our products would likely increase. Likewise, if demand or output in these industries declines, the demand for our products would likely decrease. Prices of commodities in these industries are frequently volatile and change in response to general economic conditions, economic growth, commodity inventories and any disruptions in production. We assume certain prices for key commodities in preparing our outlooks. Commodity prices lower than those assumed in our outlooks have the potential to negatively impact our business, results of operations and financial condition. The rates of infrastructure spending, housing starts and commercial construction play a significant role in our results. Our products are an integral component of these activities, and as these activities increase or decrease inside or outside of the U.S., demand for our products may be significantly impacted, which could negatively impact our results. After declining for three years, U.S. residential housing starts began a modest recovery in the second quarter of 2009, but remain at historic lows. Housing permits in the euro-zone have continued to decline since late 2006, although U.K. housing orders increased in the fourth quarter of 2009. The situation has been compounded by a deterioration of mortgage and financial markets and has negatively impacted our sales in North America and Europe. Historically, housing starts have been volatile, and these downturns could continue or become more severe. Although the U.S. Government, and governments of many other countries, including countries in Europe, Japan and Australia, has adopted initiatives to help restore and stabilize mortgage and real estate markets and the economy generally, there is no assurance that these measures will achieve the intended effect. We expect that the developing markets (i.e. Africa, Asia/Pacific, Latin America, the Middle East and Russia), which accounted for a significant portion of our 2009 sales and revenues will experience growth during 2010. However, a slower rate of economic growth in developing markets than anticipated in our outlooks could adversely impact our business, results of operations and financial condition. Page 11  Changes in Government Monetary and Fiscal Policies Most countries have established central banks to regulate monetary systems and influence economic activities, generally by adjusting interest rates. Interest rate changes affect overall economic growth, which alter demand for residential and nonresidential structures, energy and mined products, which in turn affect sales of our products that serve these activities. Also, interest rates affect customers abilities to finance machine purchases, can change the optimal time to keep machines in a fleet and can impact the ability of our suppliers to finance the production of parts and components necessary to manufacture and support our products. Our outlooks typically include assumptions about interest rates in a number of countries. Interest rates higher than those contained in our assumptions could result in lower sales than anticipated and supply chain inefficiencies. Economic events have reduced the availability of liquidity to fund investments in many markets that we serve. Central banks and other policy arms of many countries have implemented various actions to restore liquidity and increase the availability of credit. The continuing effectiveness of these and related government actions is uncertain and could have a material impact on the customers and markets we serve and our business, results of operations and financial condition. Government policies on taxes and spending affect our business. Throughout the world, government spending finances much infrastructure development, such as highways, airports, sewer and water systems and dams. Tax regulations determine depreciation lives and the amount of money users can retain, both of which influence investment decisions. Developments more unfavorable than anticipated, such as declines in government revenues, decisions to reduce public spending or increases in taxes, could negatively impact our results. Changes in Price and Significant Shortages of Component Products We are a significant user of steel and many other commodities required for the manufacture of our products. As a result, unanticipated increases in the prices of such commodities would increase our costs more than expected, negatively impacting our business, results of operations and financial condition if we are unable to fully offset the effect of these increased costs through price increases, productivity improvements or cost reduction programs. We rely on suppliers to secure component products, particularly steel, required for the manufacture of our products. During the global economic downturn, we reduced our own production levels and, as a result, our suppliers experienced significant decreases in demand for their products. We anticipate significant volume increases in 2010 and are currently reviewing the ability of key suppliers to ramp up production. A disruption in deliveries to or from suppliers or decreased availability of such components or commodities could have an adverse effect on our ability to meet our commitments to customers or increase our operating costs. We believe our sources of raw materials and components products will be generally sufficient for our needs in the foreseeable future. However, our business, results of operations or financial condition could be negatively impacted should supply turn out to be insufficient for our operations. In addition, global economic conditions and the volatility in the credit and capital markets have caused a significant decline in sales and revenues and restricted access to liquidity and financing for many businesses. If these conditions continue or worsen, many of our suppliers financial viability could be adversely impacted. As a result, their ability to continue supplying component products for the manufacture of our products could be significantly undermined, which, in turn, could negatively impact our ability to meet our customers demand for our products and our business, results of operations and financial condition. Environmental Regulations Regulatory Compliance in General Our facilities, operations and products are subject to increasingly stringent environmental laws and regulations, including laws and regulations governing emissions to air, discharges to water and the generation, handling, storage, transportation, treatment and disposal of general, non-hazardous and hazardous waste materials. While we believe we are in compliance in all material respects with these environmental laws and regulations, we cannot provide assurances that we will not be adversely affected by costs, liabilities or claims with respect to existing or subsequently acquired operations or under present laws and regulations or those that may be adopted or imposed in the future. Page 12 In particular, our engines are subject to extensive statutory and regulatory requirements governing exhaust emissions and noise, including standards imposed by the EPA, state regulatory agencies in the U.S. and other regulatory agencies around the world. For instance, national, state or local governments may set new emissions standards that could impact our products and operations in ways that are difficult to anticipate with accuracy. Thus, significant changes in standards, or the adoption of new standards, have the potential to negatively impact our business, results of operations, financial condition and competitive position. Tier 4 Emissions Requirements The EPA has adopted new and more stringent emission standards, including Tier 4 nonroad diesel emission requirements applicable to the majority of our nonroad machinery and engine products commencing in 2011. We previously announced our intent to make our nonroad engines compliant with the new emission standards, including the Tier 4 emission requirements, by the stated deadline. We intend to use certain technology with state of the art integrated systems, as well as the transitional provisions provided by the regulations in order to comply with the Tier 4 emissions requirements. Although we are executing comprehensive plans designed to meet Tier 4 emissions requirements, these plans are subject to many variables, including the timing of our Tier 4 engine development and new machine product introduction. If we are unable to meet our plans as projected, it could delay or inhibit our ability to continue placing certain products on the market, which could negatively impact our financial results and competitive position. We are incurring research and development costs to design products to meet Tier 4 requirements. We plan to include costs associated with Tier 4 development and production in prices of our products. The level of market acceptance of prices for products that meet Tier 4 requirements could negatively impact our financial results and competitive position. Regulation of Carbon Emissions The potential for government-mandated reductions of carbon emissions from our facilities and products is increasing. Mandatory reductions being considered by many jurisdictions may take the form of new legislation and/or regulations. For example, in the U.S., the EPA has stated that it plans to promulgate regulations governing carbon emissions from automobiles, which may lead to regulation of other mobile sources, as well as stationary sources. Additionally, the American Clean Energy and Security Act has passed the U.S. House of Representatives, and similar legislation has been introduced in the U.S. Senate. This legislation is also designed to restrict and reduce carbon emissions from U.S. stationary and mobile sources. The final details and scope of these legislative and regulatory measures are unclear and their potential impact is still uncertain, so we cannot fully predict the impact on the company. Should final legislation or regulations be adopted imposing significant operational restrictions and compliance requirements upon us or our products, they could have a material impact upon the companys capital expenditures, results of operations and competitive position. Failure to Maintain Credit Ratings Caterpillars and Cat Financials costs of borrowing and ability to access the capital markets are affected not only by market conditions but also by the short- and long-term debt ratings assigned to their debt by the major credit rating agencies. These ratings are based, in significant part, on Caterpillars and Cat Financials performance as measured by credit metrics such as interest coverage and leverage ratios, as well as transparency with rating agencies and timeliness of financial reporting. On January 26, 2009, Moodys Investment Services (Moody's) changed its outlook for the long-term ratings of the company and Cat Financial to negative from stable. Moodys did not alter the A2 long-term ratings or the Prime-1 short-term ratings of the two companies. On April 21, 2009, Standard  Poors Ratings Services (SP) revised its outlook for the company and Cat Financial to negative from stable, while affirming the A long-term corporate credit rating and A-1 short-term ratings on the company and its related entities. On April 22, 2009, Fitch Ratings, which had previously rated Caterpillar and Cat Financial slightly higher than Moodys and SP, downgraded the company and Cat Financial to A from A+ and assigned a stable rating outlook. On May 6, 2009, DBRS, which had similarly rated Caterpillar and Cat Financial slightly higher than Moodys and SP, downgraded the company and Cat Financial to A from A (high) and stated that the trend for the rating was stable. Although the company and Cat Financial have committed credit facilities to provide liquidity, any downgrades of our credit ratings may increase our cost of borrowing and could have a further adverse effect on our access to the capital markets, including restricting, in whole or in part, our access to the commercial paper market. There can be no assurance that the commercial paper market will continue to be a reliable source of short-term financing for the company. An inability to access the capital markets could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Page 13  Risks to Financial Products Line of Business Inherent in the operation of Cat Financial is the credit risk associated with its customers. The creditworthiness of each customer, and the rate of delinquencies, repossessions and net losses on customer obligations are directly impacted by several factors, including, but not limited to, relevant industry and economic conditions, the availability of capital, the experience and expertise of the customers management team, commodity prices, political events and the sustained value of the underlying collateral. Changes in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and market liquidity conditions could have a material adverse effect on Cat Financials and our earnings and cash flows. Because a significant amount of the loans made by Cat Financial are made at fixed interest rates, its business is subject to fluctuations in interest rates. Changes in market interest rates may influence its financing costs, returns on financial investments and the valuation of derivative contracts and could reduce its and our earnings and cash flows. In addition, since Cat Financial makes a significant amount of loans in currencies other than the U.S. dollar, fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could also reduce its and our earnings and cash flows. Cat Financial also relies on a number of diversified global debt markets and funding programs to provide liquidity for its global operations, including commercial paper, medium term notes, retail notes, variable denomination floating rate demand notes, asset-backed securitizations and bank loans. Significant changes in market liquidity conditions could impact Cat Financials access to funding, increase the associated funding costs and reduce its and our earnings and cash flows. Although Cat Financial manages interest rate, foreign currency exchange rate and market liquidity risks through a variety of techniques, including a match funding program, the selective use of derivatives and a broadly diversified funding program, there can be no assurance that fluctuations in interest rates, currency exchange rates and market liquidity conditions will not have a material adverse effect on its and our earnings and cash flows. If any of the variety of instruments and strategies Cat Financial uses to hedge its exposure to these various types of risk is ineffective, we may incur losses. With respect to Cat Financials insurance and investment management operations, changes in the equity and bond markets could cause an impairment of the value of its investment portfolio, thus requiring a negative adjustment to earnings. The recent difficult and volatile market conditions have adversely affected the financial industry in which Cat Financial operates. Cat Financial is significant to our operations and provides financing support to a significant share of our global sales. The inability of Cat Financial to access funds to support its financing activities to our customers could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Cat Financials liquidity and ongoing profitability are, in large part, dependent upon its timely access to capital and the costs associated with raising funds in different segments of the capital markets. Cat Financial depends and will continue to depend on its ability to access diversified funding alternatives to meet future cash flows requirements and to continue to fund its operations. A large portion of Cat Financials borrowings have been issued in the medium term note and commercial paper markets. While Cat Financial has maintained access to key global medium term note and commercial paper markets, there can be no assurance that such markets will continue to represent a reliable source of financing for Cat Financial. Should global economic conditions deteriorate or access to debt markets be reduced, Cat Financial could experience materially higher financing costs and become unable to access adequate funding to operate and grow its business and/or meet its debt service obligations as they mature, or it could be required to draw upon contractually committed lending agreements primarily provided by global banks and/or by seeking other funding sources. However, under extreme market conditions, there can be no assurance such agreements and other funding sources would be available or sufficient. Any of these events could negatively impact Cat Financials business, results of operations and financial condition. The extent of any impact on our ability to meet funding or liquidity needs will depend on several factors, including our operating cash flows, the duration of any future market disruptions, the effects of governmental intervention in the financial markets including the effects of any programs or legislation designed to increase or restrict liquidity for certain areas of the market, general credit conditions, the volatility of equity and debt markets, our credit ratings and credit capacity and the cost of financing and other general economic and business conditions. Should current levels of market disruption and volatility continue or worsen, we may also face a number of other risks in connection with these events, including: ##TABLE_START   Market developments that may affect customer confidence levels and may cause declines in credit applications and adverse changes in payment patterns, causing increases in delinquencies and default rates, which could impact Cat Financials write-offs and provision for credit losses. ##TABLE_END Page 14 ##TABLE_START   The process Cat Financial uses to estimate losses inherent in its credit exposure requires a high degree of managements judgment regarding numerous subjective qualitative factors, including forecasts of economic conditions and how economic predictors might impair the ability of its borrowers to repay their loans. Ongoing financial market disruption and volatility may impact the accuracy of these judgments. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START   Cat Financials ability to engage in routine funding transactions or borrow from other financial institutions on acceptable terms or at all could be adversely affected by further disruptions in the capital markets or other events, including actions by rating agencies and deteriorating investor expectations. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START   Since Cat Financials counterparties are primarily financial institutions, their ability to perform in accordance with any of its underlying agreements could be adversely affected by market volatility and/or disruptions in the equity and credit markets. ##TABLE_END Market Acceptance of Products Our business relies on continued global demand for our brands and products. To achieve business goals, we must develop and sell products that appeal to our dealers, OEMs and customers. This is dependent on a number of factors, including our ability to manage and maintain key dealer relationships, our ability to produce products that meet the quality expectations of our customers and our ability to develop effective sales, advertising and marketing programs. In addition, our continued success in selling products that appeal to our customers is dependent on leading-edge innovation, with respect to both products and operations, and on the availability and effectiveness of legal protection for our innovation. Failure to continue to deliver quality and competitive products to the marketplace, to supply products that meet applicable regulatory requirements or to predict market demands for, or gain market acceptance of, our products, could have a material impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition. In addition, the global demand for our products generally depends on our customers ability to pay for our products, which, in turn, depends on their access to funds. Due to global economic conditions many of our customers may be experiencing increased difficulty in generating funds from operations. Further, due to capital and credit market volatility and uncertainty, many financial institutions have revised their lending standards, thereby decreasing access to capital. If the capital and credit market volatility continues or worsens, the liquidity of our customers may decline which, in turn, would reduce their ability to purchase our products. Competition We operate in a highly competitive environment, and our outlook depends on a forecast of the companys share of industry sales based on our ability to compete with others in the marketplace. The company competes on the basis of product performance, customer service, quality and price. There can be no assurance that our products will be able to compete successfully with these other companies. Thus, our share of industry sales could be reduced due to aggressive pricing or product strategies pursued by competitors, unanticipated product or manufacturing difficulties, our failure to price our products competitively, our failure to produce our products at a competitive cost or an unexpected buildup in competitors new machine or dealer-owned rental fleets, leading to severe downward pressure on machine rental rates and/or used equipment prices. The environment remains competitive from a pricing standpoint. Our sales outlook assumes certain price increases that we announce from time to time will hold in the marketplace. Changes in market acceptance of price increases, changes in market requirements for price discounts or changes in our competitors behavior could have a material impact on the companys business, results of operations and financial condition. In addition, our results and ability to compete may be impacted positively or negatively by changes in our sales mix. Our outlook assumes a certain geographic mix of sales as well as a product mix of sales. If actual results vary from this projected geographic and product mix of sales, our results could be negatively impacted. Caterpillar Production System In 2006, we launched a significant productivity initiative, CPS to improve our order-to-delivery processes and factory efficiency. CPS aims to reduce waste and maximize value for our customers. Inability or failure to implement and utilize CPS or other productivity initiatives would have an adverse impact on our business and our results of operations. There can be no assurance that this initiative will be completed or beneficial to the company, or that any estimated cost savings from CPS will be realized. Page 15  International Trade Policy Government policies on international trade and investment such as import quotas, capital controls or tariffs, whether adopted by individual governments or addressed by regional trade blocs, can affect the demand for our products and services, impact the competitive position of our products or prevent us from being able to sell products in certain countries. The implementation of more restrictive trade policies, such as more detailed inspections, higher tariffs or new barriers to entry, in countries in which we sell large quantities of products and services could negatively impact our business, results of operations and financial condition. For example, a governments adoption of buy national policies or retaliation by another government against such policies could have a negative impact on our results of operations. Risks Due to Debt Covenants We maintain a number of credit facilities to support (i) our commercial paper program and (ii) general corporate purposes (facilities) and have issued debt securities to manage liquidity and fund operations (debt securities). The agreements relating to a number of the facilities and the debt securities contain certain restrictive covenants applicable to us and certain of our subsidiaries, including Cat Financial. These covenants include maintaining a consolidated net worth (defined as the consolidated stockholders equity including preferred stock but excluding the pension and other post-retirement benefits balance within accumulated other comprehensive income (loss)) of not less than $9 billion, limitations on the incurrence of liens and certain restrictions on consolidation and merger. Cat Financial has also agreed under certain of these agreements to maintain a leverage ratio (consolidated debt to consolidated net worth, calculated (1) on a monthly basis as the average of the leverage ratios determined on the last day of each of the six preceding calendar months and (2) at each December 31) not greater than 10.0 to 1, to maintain a minimum interest coverage ratio (profit excluding income taxes, interest expense and net gain/(loss) from interest rate derivatives to interest expense, calculated at the end of each calendar quarter for the rolling four quarter period then most recently ended) of not less than 1.15 to 1 and not to terminate, amend or modify its support agreement with us. Although we do not believe any of these covenants presently materially restrict our operations, a breach of one or more of the covenants could result in material adverse consequences that could negatively impact our business, results of operations and financial condition. These consequences may include the acceleration of amounts outstanding under certain of the facilities, triggering of an obligation to redeem certain debt securities, termination of existing unused commitments by our lenders, refusal by our lenders to extend further credit under one or more of the facilities or to enter into new facilities or the lowering or modification of our credit ratings or those of one or more of our subsidiaries. In 2008, we received the consent of lenders under certain of our facilities to our lower consolidated net worth of $6.087 billion as of December 31, 2008 and to Cat Financials lower quarterly interest coverage ratio of 0.97 as of December 31, 2008. In consideration of these consents, we agreed to increase the upper range of interest rates applicable to amounts that may be drawn by us and Cat Financial under certain of our facilities. Dealer/Original Equipment Manufacturers Sourcing Practices We sell finished products through an independent dealer network and directly to OEMs. Both carry inventories of finished products as part of ongoing operations and adjust those inventories based on their assessments of future needs. Such adjustments can impact our results either positively or negatively. In particular, some of our engine customers are OEMs that manufacture or could in the future manufacture engines for their own products. Despite their engine manufacturing abilities, these customers have chosen to outsource certain types of engine production to us due to the quality of our engine products and in order to reduce costs, eliminate production risks and maintain company focus. However, we cannot assure that these customers will continue to outsource engine manufacture in the future. Increased levels of production insourcing by these customers could result from a number of factors, such as shifts in our customers business strategies, acquisition by a customer of another engine manufacturer, the inability of third-party suppliers to meet specifications and the emergence of low-cost production opportunities in foreign countries. A significant reduction in the level of engine production outsourcing from our OEM customers could significantly impact our revenues and, accordingly, have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Page 16  Additional Tax Expense or Additional Tax Exposure We are subject to income taxes in the United States and numerous foreign jurisdictions, and our domestic and international tax liabilities are dependent upon the distribution of income among these different jurisdictions. Our provision for income taxes and cash tax liability in the future could be adversely affected by numerous factors including, but not limited to, income before taxes being lower than anticipated in countries with lower statutory tax rates and higher than anticipated in countries with higher statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities and changes in tax laws and regulations. We are also subject to the continuous examination of our income tax returns by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities. The results of audits and examinations of previously filed tax returns and continuing assessments of our tax exposures may have an adverse effect on the companys provision for income taxes and cash tax liability. Risks to Global Operations Our global operations are dependent upon products manufactured, purchased and sold in the U.S. and internationally and in countries with political and economic instability including, without limitation, Brazil, PRC and India, which exposes our business operations to certain political and economic risks inherent in operating globally. These risks include: ##TABLE_START   changes in local government laws, regulations and policies; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START   imposition of currency restrictions, restrictions on repatriation of earnings or other restraints; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START   imposition of burdensome tariffs or quotas; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START   national and international conflict, including terrorist acts; and ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START   political and economic instability or civil unrest may severely disrupt economic activity in affected countries. ##TABLE_END As a normal practice, we do not assume such events in our outlooks unless they are already happening when the outlook is issued. As a result, the occurrence of one or more of these events has the potential to negatively impact our business, results of operations and financial condition. Currency Fluctuations The reporting currency for our financial statements is the U.S. dollar. Certain of our assets, liabilities, expenses and revenues, are denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. To prepare our consolidated financial statements, we must translate those assets, liabilities, expenses and revenues into U.S. dollars at the applicable exchange rates. As a result, increases and decreases in the value of the U.S. dollar vis--vis other currencies will affect the U.S. dollar amounts of these items in our consolidated financial statements, even if their value has not changed in their original currency. This could have a significant impact on our results of operations and financial condition if such increases or decreases in the value of the U.S. dollar are substantial. Risk Due to Funding Obligations Under Pension Plans We maintain certain defined benefit pension plans for our employees, which impose on us certain funding obligations. In determining our future payment obligations under the plans, we assume certain rates of return on the plan assets and growth rates of certain costs. Significant adverse changes in credit or capital markets could result in actual rates of return being materially lower than projected. Our cost growth rates may also be materially higher than projected. These factors could significantly increase our payment obligations under the plans, require us to take a significant charge on our balance sheet and, as a result, adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. Impact of Acquisitions We may from time to time engage in acquisitions involving risks, including failure to successfully integrate and realize the expected benefits of such acquisitions. For example, with any past or future acquisitions, there is the possibility that: ##TABLE_START   The business culture of the acquired business may not match well with our culture; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START   Technological and product synergies, economies of scale and cost reductions may not occur as expected; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START   The company may acquire or assume unexpected liabilities; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START   Unforeseen difficulties may arise in integrating operations and systems; ##TABLE_END Page 17 ##TABLE_START   The company may fail to retain and assimilate employees of the acquired business; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START   Higher than expected finance costs may arise due to unforeseen changes in tax, trade, environmental, labor, safety, payroll or pension policies in any jurisdiction in which the acquired business conducts its operations; and ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START   The company may experience problems in retaining customers and integrating customer bases. ##TABLE_END Failure to continue implementing the companys acquisition strategy, including successfully integrating acquired businesses, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, in order to conserve cash for operations, we may undertake acquisitions that would be financed in part through public offerings or private placements of debt or equity securities, or other arrangements. Such acquisition financing could result in a decrease of our ratio of earnings to fixed charges and adversely affect other leverage measures. We cannot guarantee any such acquisition financing would be available to us on acceptable terms if and when required. If we were to undertake an acquisition by issuing equity securities or equity-linked securities, the issued securities may have a dilutive effect on the interests of the holders of our common shares. Litigation and Contingency We face an inherent business risk of exposure to various types of claims and lawsuits. We are involved in various intellectual property, product liability, product warranty and environmental claims and lawsuits and other legal proceedings that arise in and outside of the ordinary course of our business. Although it is not possible to predict with certainty the outcome of every claim and lawsuit, we believe these lawsuits and claims will not individually or in the aggregate have a material impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition. However, we could in the future incur judgments or enter into settlements of lawsuits and claims that could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition in any particular period. In addition, while we maintain insurance coverage with respect to certain claims, we may not be able to obtain such insurance on acceptable terms in the future, if at all, and any such insurance may not provide adequate coverage against any such claims. As required by U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), we establish reserves based on our assessment of such contingencies. Subsequent developments in legal proceedings may affect our assessment and estimates of the loss contingency recorded as a reserve, requiring us to make additional material payments, which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations. Healthcare Reform Legislation Healthcare reform is currently a high priority for the U.S. Presidential Administration and U.S. Congress. Both the U.S. House and the U.S. Senate have passed healthcare reform bills. However, this legislation remains subject to modification during the process of harmonizing the House and Senate bills and its content and potential impact remain uncertain. Should any final legislation impose significant costs on the company, including, without limitation, by making government subsidies received for Medicare-equivalent prescription drug coverage taxable, this could have a material impact upon the companys results of operations and competitive position. Changes in Accounting Standards Our financial statements are subject to the application of GAAP, which are periodically revised and/or expanded. Accordingly, from time to time we are required to adopt new or revised accounting standards issued by recognized authoritative bodies, including the Financial Accounting Standards Board. Market conditions have prompted accounting standard setters to issue new guidance which further interprets or seeks to revise accounting pronouncements related to financial instruments, structures or transactions as well as to issue new standards expanding disclosures. The impact of accounting pronouncements that have been issued but not yet implemented is disclosed in our annual and quarterly reports on Form 10-K and Form 10-Q. An assessment of proposed standards is not provided, as such proposals are subject to change through the exposure process and, therefore, their effects on our financial statements cannot be meaningfully assessed. It is possible that future accounting standards we are required to adopt could change the current accounting treatment that we apply to our consolidated financial statements and that such changes could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Page 18  Natural Disasters The occurrence of one or more natural disasters, such as tornadoes, hurricanes, earthquakes and other forms of severe weather in the U.S. or in a country in which we operate or in which our suppliers are located could adversely affect our operations and financial performance. Such events could result in physical damage to and complete or partial closure of one or more of our manufacturing facilities or distribution centers, temporary or long-term disruption in the supply of component products from some local and overseas suppliers, disruption in the transport of our products to dealers and end-users and delay in the delivery of our products to our distribution centers. ##TABLE_START ", "1B": " Item 1B.

Properties . ##TABLE_END General Information Caterpillars operations are highly integrated. Although the majority of our plants are involved primarily in production relating to our Machinery or Engines lines of business, several plants are involved in manufacturing relating to both lines of business. In addition, several plants are involved in the manufacturing of components which are used in the assembly of both machines and engines. Caterpillars parts distribution centers are involved in the storage and distribution of parts for machines and engines. Also, the research and development activities carried on at our Technical Center involve both machines and engines. Page 19  Properties we own are believed to be generally well maintained and adequate for present use. Through planned capital expenditures, we expect these properties to remain adequate for future needs. Properties we lease are covered by leases expiring over terms of generally one to ten years. We anticipate no difficulty in retaining occupancy of any leased facilities, either by renewing leases prior to expiration or by replacing them with equivalent leased facilities. Headquarters and Other Key Offices Our corporate headquarters are in Peoria, Illinois. Additional marketing and operating headquarters are located both inside and outside the United States including Miami, Florida, San Diego, California, Geneva, Switzerland, Beijing, PRC, Singapore, Piracicaba, Brazil and Tokyo, Japan. The Financial Products Division is headquartered in leased offices located in Nashville, Tennessee. Parts Distribution Centers Distribution of our parts is conducted from parts distribution centers inside and outside the United States. Cat Logistics distributes other companies products, using both Caterpillar and non-Caterpillar facilities located both inside and outside the United States. We also own or lease other storage facilities that support distribution activities. Technical Center, Training Centers, Demonstration Areas and Proving Grounds We own a Technical Center located in Mossville, Illinois, and various other technical and training centers, demonstration areas and proving grounds located both inside and outside the United States. Manufacturing, Remanufacturing and Overhaul Manufacturing, remanufacturing and overhaul of our products are conducted primarily at the following locations. These facilities are believed to be suitable for their intended purposes with adequate capacities for current and projected needs for existing products.

Legal Proceedings. ##TABLE_END We have disclosed certain individual legal proceedings in this filing. Additionally, we are involved in other unresolved legal actions that arise in the normal course of business. The most prevalent of these unresolved actions involve disputes related to product design, manufacture and performance liability (including claimed asbestos and welding fumes exposure), contracts, employment issues or intellectual property rights. Although it is not possible to predict with certainty the outcome of these unresolved legal actions, we believe that these actions will not individually or in the aggregate have a material adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations, financial position or liquidity. On May 14, 2007, the EPA issued a Notice of Violation to Caterpillar Inc. alleging various violations of Clean Air Act Sections 203, 206 and 207. The EPA claims that Caterpillar violated such sections by shipping engines and catalytic converter after-treatment devices separately, introducing into commerce a number of uncertified and/or misbuilt engines, and failing to timely report emissions-related defects. Caterpillar is currently engaging in negotiations with the EPA to resolve these issues, but it is too early in the process to place precise estimates on the potential exposure to penalties. However, Caterpillar is cooperating with the EPA and, based upon initial discussions, and although penalties could potentially exceed $100,000, management does not believe that this issue will have a material adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations, financial position or liquidity. On February 8, 2009, an incident at Caterpillars Joliet, Illinois facility resulted in the release of approximately 3,000 gallons of wastewater into the Des Plaines River. In coordination with state and federal authorities, appropriate remediation measures have been taken. On February 23, 2009 the Illinois Attorney General filed a Complaint in Will County Circuit Court containing seven counts of violations of state environmental laws and regulations. Each count seeks injunctive relief, as well as statutory penalties of $50,000 per violation and $10,000 per day of violation. In addition, on March 5, 2009 the EPA served Caterpillar with a Notice of Intent to file a Civil Administrative Action (notice), indicating the EPAs intent to seek civil penalties for violations of the Clean Water Act and Oil Pollution Act. On January 25, 2010, the EPA issued a revised notice seeking civil penalties in the amount of $167,800, and Caterpillar is preparing a response to the revised notice. At this time, we do not believe these proceedings will have a material adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations, financial position or liquidity. ##TABLE_START ", "4": " Item 4.

Based on this evaluation, our chief executive officer and our chief financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of the end of the period covered by this annual report. Managements Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting The management of Caterpillar Inc. is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Our internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of our financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Our internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.  Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.  Management assessed the effectiveness of the company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2009. In making this assessment, we used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework . Based on our assessment we concluded that, as of December 31, 2009, the company's internal control over financial reporting was effective based on those criteria.  The effectiveness of the company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2009 has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm. Their report appears on page A-4 of Exhibit 13. Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting During the last fiscal quarter, there has been no significant change in the companys internal control over financial reporting that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the companys internal control over financial reporting. ##TABLE_START ", "9B": " Item 9B.

Business.  General  The company was originally organized as Caterpillar Tractor Co. in 1925 in the State of California. In 1986, the company reorganized as Caterpillar Inc. in the State of Delaware. As used herein, the term Caterpillar, we, us, our, or the company refers to Caterpillar Inc. and its subsidiaries unless designated or identified otherwise.  Principal Lines of Business / Nature of Operations  We operate in three principal lines of business:  1.  Machinery  A principal line of business which includes the design, manufacture, marketing and sales of construction, mining and forestry machinerytrack and wheel tractors, track and wheel loaders, pipelayers, motor graders, wheel tractor-scrapers, track and wheel excavators, backhoe loaders, log skidders, log loaders, off-highway trucks, articulated trucks, paving products, skid steer loaders, underground mining equipment, tunnel boring equipment and related parts. In addition, this line of business also includes Electro-Motive Diesel, Inc. (EMD), a manufacturer of diesel-electric locomotives, which we acquired in 2010. Also includes the design, manufacture, remanufacture, maintenance and services of rail-related products and logistics services for other companies.  2.  Engines  A principal line of business including the design, manufacture, marketing and sales of engines for Caterpillar machinery; electric power generation systems; marine, petroleum, construction, industrial, agricultural and other applications and related parts. Also includes remanufacturing of Caterpillar engines and a variety of Caterpillar machine and engine components and remanufacturing services for other companies. Reciprocating engines meet power needs ranging from 10 to 21,700 horsepower (8 to over 16 000 kilowatts). Turbines range from 1,600 to 30,000 horsepower (1 200 to 22 000 kilowatts).  3.  Financial Products  A principal line of business consisting primarily of Caterpillar Financial Services Corporation (Cat Financial), Caterpillar Insurance Holdings Inc. (Cat Insurance) and their respective subsidiaries. Cat Financial provides a wide range of financing alternatives to customers and dealers for Caterpillar machinery and engines, Solar gas turbines as well as other equipment and marine vessels. Cat Financial also extends loans to customers and dealers. Cat Insurance provides various forms of insurance to customers and dealers to help support the purchase and lease of our equipment.  Due to financial information required by accounting guidance on segment reporting , we have also divided our business into 12 reportable segments for financial reporting purposes. Information about our reportable segments, including geographic information, appears in Note 22  Segment information of Exhibit 13.  Other information about our operations in 2010, including certain risks associated with our operations, is incorporated by reference from Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations of Exhibit 13.  Company Strengths  For more than 85 years, Caterpillar has been making sustainable progress possible and driving positive change on every continent. With 2010 sales and revenues of $42.588 billion, Caterpillar is the worlds leading manufacturer of construction and mining equipment, diesel and natural gas engines, industrial gas turbines and diesel-electric locomotives. The company also is a leading services provider through Cat Financial, Caterpillar Remanufacturing Services, Caterpillar Logistics Services, Inc. (Cat Logistics) and Progress Rail Services Corporation (Progress Rail). Caterpillar is also a leading U.S. exporter. Through a global network of independent dealers and direct sales of certain products, Caterpillar builds long-term relationships with customers around the world.  Competitive Environment  Caterpillar products and product support services are sold worldwide into a variety of highly competitive markets. In all markets, we compete on the basis of product performance, customer service, quality and price. From time to time, the intensity of competition results in price discounting in a particular industry or region. Such price discounting puts pressure on margins and can negatively impact operating profit.  Outside of the United States, certain of our competitors enjoy competitive advantages inherent to operating in their home countries or regions.   Machinery  The competitive environment for Caterpillars machinery business consists of some global competitors and many regional and specialized local competitors. Examples of global competitors include, but are not limited to, Komatsu Ltd., Volvo Construction Equipment (part of the Volvo Group AB), CNH Global N.V., Deere  Co., Hitachi Construction Machinery Co., J.C.Bamford Ltd., Doosan Infracore Co., Ltd. and LiuGong Construction Machinery N.A., LLC. Each of these companies have varying numbers of product lines that compete with Caterpillar products, and each have varying degrees of regional focus.  The world economy started to recover from its worst postwar recession in 2009 and that recovery continued throughout 2010. Developing countries had the strongest recoveries, which increased the need for construction and commodities. End users increased equipment purchases to meet this increased demand and dealers began rebuilding their inventories to support higher deliveries. Economic recoveries in the developed economies were weak and unemployment remained near record highs. Most construction continued to decline in developed economies. Despite weak economic recoveries and construction declines, end users purchased more equipment to slow deterioration in their fleets. In response, dealers added to their inventories. Worldwide, the change in dealer inventory practices and increased deliveries to end users resulted in a significant increase in machine sales volume in 2010.  Caterpillars logistics business provides integrated supply chain services for Caterpillar and approximately 50 customers worldwide. It competes with global, regional and local logistics competitors, including companies such as DHL International, CEVA Logistics and Kuehne + Nagel Inc. The unit has grown significantly since its inception in 1987.  Caterpillar also provides rail-related products and services through its wholly owned subsidiary, Progress Rail. Progress Rail is a leading provider of a broad range of products and services to the railroad industry, including new and remanufactured locomotives, railcar and track products and design and maintenance services. It competes with global, regional and local competitors, including companies such as GE Transportation, Bombardier, Siemens and VAE Nortrak North America, Inc.  Engines  Caterpillar operates in a very competitive engine/turbine manufacturing and packaging environment. The company designs, manufactures, markets and sells diesel, heavy fuel and natural gas reciprocating engines for Caterpillar machinery, electric power generation systems, locomotives, marine, petroleum, construction, industrial, agricultural and other applications. In addition, Caterpillar provides industrial turbines and turbine-related services for oil and gas and power generation applications.  The global competitive environment for reciprocating engines in marine, petroleum, construction, industrial, agriculture and electric power generation systems along with turbines consists of a few larger global competitors who compete in a variety of markets that Caterpillar serves, and a substantial number of smaller companies who compete in a limited-size product range, geographic region and/or application. Principal global competitors include, but are not limited to, Cummins Inc., Tognum AG, GE Energy Infrastructure, Siemens Energy and Wartsila Corp. Other competitors, such as John Deere Power Systems, MAN Diesel SE, Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Ltd., Volvo Penta (part of Volvo Group AB), Kawasaki Heavy Industries, multiple emerging Chinese competitors and Rolls Royce Group plc compete in certain markets in which Caterpillar competes. An additional set of competitors, including Generac Power Systems, Inc., Kohler Co., and others, are packagers who source engines and/or other components from domestic and international suppliers and market products regionally and internationally through a variety of distribution channels.  As previously announced, Caterpillar no longer provides new engines for trucks and other on-highway original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) subject to current U.S. and European emissions regulations. Caterpillar will continue to service our previous on-highway engine customers through Caterpillar and truck OEM dealer channels.  Since the introduction of Caterpillars ACERT Technology in 2003, Caterpillar has continued to focus investment and resources on leveraging this technology. The building blocks for ACERT Technology are flexible and scalable and are being applied as needed based on engine platform and application. Caterpillar is adding several new technologies to our portfolio of ACERT Technologies to meet Tier 4 Interim/Stage IIIB non-road emissions regulations. We believe ACERT provides Caterpillar with a valuable foundation to meet emissions and performance requirements.  Caterpillars remanufacturing business provides services for a variety of products to Caterpillar and other external clients. The remanufacturing business competes on a regional basis with similarly sized or smaller companies. The company launched the remanufacturing business in the 1970s with engines/turbines and is now one of the worlds largest remanufacturers, processing   more than two million units annually and recycling more than 150 million pounds of remanufactured products each year. The business continues to grow at rates well above that of the global economy as a whole.  Financial Products  Our financial products business is primarily conducted by Cat Financial. Cat Financial, incorporated in Delaware, is a wholly owned finance subsidiary of Caterpillar. Cat Financials primary business is to provide retail and wholesale financing alternatives for Caterpillar products to customers and dealers around the world. Retail financing is primarily comprised of financing of Caterpillar equipment, machinery and engines. Cat Financial also provides financing for vehicles, power generation facilities and marine vessels that, in most cases, incorporate Caterpillar products. In addition to retail financing, Cat Financial provides wholesale financing to Caterpillar dealers and purchases short-term dealer receivables from Caterpillar and its subsidiaries. The various financing plans offered by Cat Financial are primarily designed to increase the opportunity for sales of Caterpillar products and generate financing income for Cat Financial. A significant portion of Cat Financials activities is conducted in North America. However, Cat Financial has additional offices and subsidiaries in Asia, Australia, Europe and Latin America.  For over 25 years, Cat Financial has been providing financing in the various markets in which it participates, contributing to its knowledge of asset values, industry trends, product structuring and customer needs.  In certain instances, Cat Financials operations are subject to supervision and regulation by state, federal and various foreign governmental authorities, and may be subject to various laws and judicial and administrative decisions imposing requirements and restrictions which, among other things, (i) regulate credit granting activities and the administration of loans, (ii) establish maximum interest rates, finance charges and other charges, (iii) require disclosures to customers and investors, (iv) govern secured transactions, (v) set collection, foreclosure, repossession and other trade practices and (vi) regulate the use and reporting of information related to a borrowers credit experience. Cat Financials ability to comply with these governmental and legal requirements and restrictions affects its operations.  Cat Financials retail leases and installment sale contracts (totaling 56 percent*) include:    Tax leases that are classified as either operating or finance leases for financial accounting purposes, depending on the characteristics of the lease. For tax purposes, Cat Financial is considered the owner of the equipment (16 percent*).    Finance (non-tax) leases, where the lessee for tax purposes is considered to be the owner of the equipment during the term of the lease, that either require or allow the customer to purchase the equipment for a fixed price at the end of the term (21 percent*).    Installment sale contracts, which are equipment loans that enable customers to purchase equipment with a down payment or trade-in and structure payments over time (18 percent*).    Governmental lease-purchase plans in the U.S. that offer low interest rates and flexible terms to qualified non-federal government agencies (1 percent*).  Cat Financials wholesale notes receivable, finance leases and installment sale contracts (totaling 12 percent*) include:    Inventory/rental programs, which provide assistance to dealers by financing their new Caterpillar inventory and rental fleets (5 percent*).    Short-term dealer receivables we purchase from Caterpillar at a discount (7 percent*).  Cat Financials retail notes receivables (32 percent*) include:    Loans that allow customers and dealers to use their Caterpillar equipment or other assets as collateral to obtain financing.  *Indicates the percentage of Cat Financials total portfolio at December 31, 2010. We define total portfolio as total finance receivables (net of unearned income and allowance for credit losses) plus equipment on operating leases, less accumulated depreciation. For more information on the above and Cat Financials concentration of credit risk, please refer to Note 6  Cat Financial Financing Activities of Exhibit 13.   Cat Financial operates in a highly competitive environment, with financing for users of Caterpillar equipment available through a variety of sources, principally commercial banks and finance and leasing companies. Cat Financials competitors include Wells Fargo Equipment Finance Inc., General Electric Capital Corporation and various local banks and finance companies. In addition, many of our manufacturing competitors own financial subsidiaries such as Volvo Financial Services, Komatsu Financial L.P. and John Deere Capital Corporation that utilize below-market interest rate programs (subsidized by the manufacturer) to assist machine sales. Caterpillar and Cat Financial work together to provide a broad array of financial merchandising programs around the world to meet these competitive offers.  Cat Financials financial results are largely dependent upon the ability of Caterpillar dealers to sell equipment and customers willingness to enter into financing or leasing agreements. It is also affected by, among other things, the availability of funds from its financing sources, general economic conditions such as inflation and market interest rates and its cost of funds relative to its competitors.  Cat Financial has a match funding policy that addresses interest rate risk by aligning the interest rate profile (fixed rate or floating rate) of its debt portfolio with the interest rate profile of its receivables portfolio (loans and leases with customers and dealers) within predetermined ranges on an ongoing basis. In connection with that policy, Cat Financial issues debt with a similar interest rate profile to its receivables, and also uses interest rate swap agreements to manage its interest rate risk exposure to interest rate changes and in some cases to lower its cost of borrowed funds. For more information regarding match funding, please see Note 3 Derivative financial instruments and risk management of Exhibit 13. See also the risk factor titled Risks to Financial Products Line of Business for general risks associated with our financial products business included in Item 1A. of this Form 10-K.  In managing foreign currency risk for Cat Financials operations, the objective is to minimize earnings volatility resulting from conversion and the remeasurement of net foreign currency balance sheet positions. This policy allows the use of foreign currency forward and option contracts to address the risk of currency mismatch between the receivable and debt portfolios. None of these foreign currency forward and option contracts are designated as a hedge.  Cat Financial provides financing only when certain criteria are met. Credit decisions are based on, among other factors, the customers credit history, financial strength and equipment application. Cat Financial typically maintains a security interest in retail-financed equipment and requires physical damage insurance coverage on financed equipment. Cat Financial finances a significant portion of Caterpillar dealers sales and inventory of Caterpillar equipment throughout the world. Cat Financials competitive position is improved by marketing programs offered in conjunction with Caterpillar and/or Caterpillar dealers. Under these programs, Caterpillar, or the dealer, subsidizes an amount at the outset of the transaction, which Cat Financial then recognizes as revenue over the term of the financing. We believe that these marketing programs provide Cat Financial a significant competitive advantage in financing Caterpillar products.

Business Developments in 2010  Economic and Market Conditions  Global economic conditions continued to improve throughout 2010, resulting in an increased demand for Caterpillar products. Our focus in 2009 on reducing costs, maintaining solid profitability and cash flow and improving our balance sheet prepared us to ramp up production and add capacity to accommodate current and expected growth in the future. During 2010, improving economies in both the developing and developed countries, replenishment of inventories and rental fleets and an increase in commodity prices all contributed to our increased sales.  Financial Results and Stockholder Value  Full year 2010 results marked a significant increase from 2009 in both sales and revenues and profit for Caterpillar. The company realized 2010 sales and revenues of $42.588 billion, a 31 percent increase from 2009, and profit of $2.7 billion, a 202 percent increase from 2009. Our profit per share in 2010 was $4.15, up from $1.43 in 2009.  Sustainability  The company has a long-standing commitment to sustainable development and in 2010, we continued to align our sustainability efforts with our business strategy. We were selected as a member of the Dow Jones Sustainability World Index (DJSI World) for the tenth consecutive year and were recognized as a leader in the Industrial Engineering sector. DJSI World uses a best-in-class approach designed to identify best practices across the economic, social and environmental dimensions of corporate sustainability.  Caterpillar Production System (CPS)  We have continued our focus on deploying CPS with 6 Sigma. Through the implementation of CPS, we believe we have made continued progress on our safety and quality goals, reduced inventory and improved cost performance. CPS continues to be an important component in achieving our near-term goals and our Vision 2020.  Strategy Update  In June 2010, we updated our Vision 2020 strategy, which was first introduced in 2005. Our updated strategy is focused on executing our business model to ensure that our customers succeed, delivering superior returns to stockholders and attracting and developing the best people. In addition, we have established key areas of focus that we believe will help us reach our goals, including increasing product development, reducing our cost structure, achieving our profit and cash pull through goals, achieving leadership positions in key industries, products and regions and continued growth in strategic markets. Our updated strategy coincided with the election of Douglas R. Oberhelman as our Chief Executive Officer and an internal reorganization that streamlined our corporate structure and realigned executive responsibilities to provide increased visibility and accountability toward reaching our goals.   Growth Initiatives  As the global economy continued to improve in 2010, the demand for our products increased substantially. In response to increased demand and improving economic conditions, we announced plans to increase capacity, expand production and make strategic acquisitions, including, but not limited to the following:  Mining    In November 2010, Caterpillar announced that it entered into an agreement to purchase Bucyrus International, Inc. (Bucyrus). Bucyrus designs and manufactures mining equipment for the surface and underground mining industries and provides service for its equipment. The acquisition is part of our strategy to grow our mining business. The transaction is subject to customary closing conditions and regulatory approvals.    A manufacturing and component assembly facility in Winston-Salem, North Carolina to provide increased capacity for our mining business. The facility will be primarily used for the machining, assembly, test and painting of axle assemblies for large mining machines.    Additional investments in our mining business relating to capacity expansion for trucks produced in Decatur, Illinois and Chennai, India.  Rail    In August 2010, Caterpillar acquired EMD. This acquisition continued our strategic plan to grow our presence in the rail industry and enables us to provide rail and transit customers with locomotive, engine and emissions solutions, aftermarket product and parts support and a broad line of rail-related services and solutions.    In May 2010, Caterpillar acquired FCM Rail Ltd. (FCM). FCM is a lessor of maintenance of way (MOW) equipment in the United States and expands our service offerings in the MOW industry.    In March 2010, Caterpillar acquired the Inspection Products business from GE Transportations Intelligent Control Systems division. This acquisition expands the scope and product range of our rail signaling business. The acquired business has operations primarily in the United States, Germany and Italy.    A manufacturing facility in Muncie, Indiana to produce diesel-electric locomotives. The facility is expected to begin production in 2012. In addition to increasing our ability to serve the diesel-electric locomotive market, we also expect to be able to pursue transit-rail opportunities, particularly in the United States.  Engines    In October 2010, Caterpillar announced that it entered into an agreement to acquire MWM Holding GmbH (MWM), headquartered in Mannheim, Germany. MWM is a supplier of engines that are capable of operating on a wide range of gaseous fuels including natural gas, biogas, mine gas and industrial waste gas. MWM focuses on generator setups, combined heat and power, trigeneration (heat, power and cooling), as well as complete turnkey solutions, and its engines cover a range of 400 to 4 300 kilowatts. The transaction is subject to customary closing conditions and regulatory approvals.    A manufacturing facility in Tianjin, China to increase worldwide capacity for our 3500 series engines. The facility is expected to begin production in 2013 and will become our third global source for these engines, with a focus on producing engines for customers in China and the Asia-Pacific region.  Excavators    Increased production capacity of excavators in China by acquiring the remaining ownership interest in Caterpillar Xuzhou Limited (CXL), a joint venture between Caterpillar and Xuzhou Construction Machinery Group (XCMG). We also announced facility expansions for small, medium and large excavators at our Xuzhou, China facility.     A manufacturing facility in Victoria, Texas to produce hydraulic excavators. The facility is expected to begin production in mid-2012 and, once fully operational, is projected to triple our current capacity for hydraulic excavators produced in the United States. The new facility will manufacture the two models of excavators now made in Aurora, Ill. as well as several additional excavator models produced in Akashi, Japan and exported to the United States.    A manufacturing facility in Wujiang, China to produce mini hydraulic excavator models in the under 8-ton range for Chinese customers. Currently, Caterpillar supplies Chinese customers with mini excavators produced at Caterpillars facility in Xuzhou, China and with machines produced in Sagami, Japan. This facility is expected to increase capacity for other Caterpillar products at our Xuzhou and Sagami operations.    An alliance agreement with Wacker Neuson SE (Wacker), located in Munich, Germany, for the design, manufacture, sale and support of Caterpillar mini hydraulic excavators in the under three-ton category. The agreement calls for Wacker to produce these excavators at its facility in Linz, Austria.  Backhoe and Wheel Loaders    A manufacturing facility in Brazil to produce backhoe loaders and small wheel loaders which are currently made at Caterpillars facility in Piracicaba, Brazil. The new facility will allow us to increase capacity for other machines produced in Piracicaba.  Compact Construction Equipment    Expansion of our compact construction equipment operations located in Sanford, North Carolina to provide increased logistics and fabrications capacity to meet the growing global demand for our skid steer, compact track and multi-terrain loaders. The expansion will facilitate increased logistics capabilities and robotic welding technology for fabrication production.  Components    A joint-venture agreement with AVIC Liyuan Hydraulics Co., Ltd. to establish a company to design and manufacture medium- and heavy-duty hydraulic pumps and motors for the construction equipment industry. The joint venture is expected to provide components for use in Caterpillar products as well as third-party machinery and equipment, and enhance our supply base and key component capacity in support of our expansion plans in China.  Engineering Design    An engineering design center in Rapid City, South Dakota to provide additional engineering support services for our U.S. operations. This center will complement the companys existing engineering design centers.  Distribution and Logistics    Completion of a new logistics center in Suzhou, China to provide inbound logistics support for our growing manufacturing footprint in China and other manufacturing operations in the Asia-Pacific region. In addition, the facility will serve as a consolidation/deconsolidation hub and provide warehousing and distribution support.    A parts distribution center in Dubai, United Arab Emirates. The new distribution center is the third facility added to Caterpillars global service parts distribution network in the last five years and is part of our multi-year expansion and enhancement of the Europe, Africa and Middle East Caterpillar parts distribution network. During the past five years, distribution capacity has been added in Shanghai, China, Moscow, Russia and Waco, Texas.  Business Combinations  Information related to acquisitions and alliances appears in Note 23  Business combinations and alliances of Exhibit 13.  Raw Materials and Component Products  We source our raw materials and manufactured components from suppliers both domestically and internationally. These purchases include unformed materials and rough and finished parts. Unformed materials include a variety of steel products, which are then cut or formed to shape and machined in our facilities. Rough parts include various sized steel and iron castings and forgings, which are machined to final specification levels inside our facilities. Finished parts are ready to assemble components, which are made either to Caterpillar specifications or to the supplier developed specifications. We machine and assemble some of the components used in our machines, engines and power generation units and to support our after-market dealer parts sales. We also purchase   various goods and services used in production, logistics, offices and product development processes. We maintain global strategic sourcing models to meet our global facilities production needs while building long-term supplier relationships and leveraging enterprise spend. We expect our suppliers to maintain, at all times, industry-leading levels of quality and the ability to timely deliver raw materials and component products for our machine and engine products. We use a variety of agreements with suppliers to protect our intellectual property and processes to monitor and mitigate risks of the supply base causing a business disruption. The risks monitored include supplier financial viability, the ability to increase or decrease production levels, business continuity, quality and delivery.  Order Backlog  The dollar amount of backlog believed to be firm was approximately $18.7 billion, $9.6 billion and $14.7 billion at December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. Of the total backlog, approximately $2.8 billion, $2.5 billion and $2.2 billion at December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively, was not expected to be filled in the following year. The backlog decrease during 2009 reflects the impact of weak global economic conditions. In 2010, order backlog increased by approximately $1 billion due to the acquisition of EMD. The remaining increase for 2010 compared to 2009 and 2008 year end is primarily due to an increase in order volume across most business units.  Dealers and Distributors  Our machines are distributed principally through a worldwide organization of dealers (dealer network), 50 located in the United States and 138 located outside the United States, serving 182 countries and operating 3,475 places of business, including dealer rental outlets. Reciprocating engines are sold principally through the dealer network and to other manufacturers for use in their products. Some of the reciprocating engines manufactured by Perkins Engines Company Limited (Perkins) are also sold through its worldwide network of 142 distributors located in 183 countries. Most of the electric power generation systems manufactured by F.G. Wilson Engineering Limited (FG Wilson) are sold through its worldwide network of 154 distributors located in 179 countries. Some of the large, medium speed reciprocating engines are also sold under the MaK brand through a worldwide network of 19 distributors located in 130 countries.  Our dealers do not deal exclusively with our products; however, in most cases sales and servicing of our products are the dealers principal business. Turbines are sold through sales forces employed by the company. At times, these employees are assisted by independent sales representatives.  The companys relationship with each of its independent dealers is memorialized in a standard sales and service agreement. Pursuant to this agreement, the company grants the dealer the right to purchase and sell its products and to service the products in a specified geographic service territory. Prices to dealers are established by the company after receiving input from dealers on transactional pricing in the marketplace. The company also agrees to defend its intellectual property and to provide warranty and technical support to the dealer. The agreement further grants the dealer a non-exclusive license to use the companys trademarks, service marks and brand names. In some instances a separate trademark agreement exists between the company and a dealer.  In exchange for these rights, the agreement obligates the dealer to develop and promote the sale of the companys products to current and prospective customers in the dealers service territory. Each dealer agrees to employ adequate sales and support personnel to market, sell and promote the companys products, demonstrate and exhibit the products, perform the companys product improvement programs, inform the company concerning any features that might affect the safe operation of any of the companys products and maintain detailed books and records of the dealers financial condition, sales and inventories and make these books and records available at the companys reasonable request.  These sales and service agreements are terminable at will by either party upon 90 days written notice and provide for termination automatically if the dealer files for bankruptcy protection or upon the occurrence of comparable action seeking protection from creditors.  Patents and Trademarks  Our products are sold primarily under the brands Caterpillar, CAT, design versions of CAT and Caterpillar, Electro-Motive, FG Wilson, MaK, Olympian, Perkins, Progress Rail and Solar Turbines. We own a number of patents and trademarks, which have been obtained over a period of years and relate to the products we manufacture and the services we provide. These patents and trademarks have been of value in the growth of our business and may continue to be of value in the future. We do not regard any of our business as being dependent upon any single patent or group of patents.  Research and Development  We have always placed strong emphasis on product-oriented research and development relating to the development of new or improved machines, engines and major components. In 2010, 2009 and 2008, we spent $1,905 million, $1,421 million and $1,728 million, or 4.5 percent, 4.4 percent, and 3.4 percent of our sales and revenues, respectively, on our research and development programs. RD expense is expected to increase about 20 percent in 2011, primarily related to the roll-out of products designed to meet applicable emissions requirements.     Employment  As of December 31, 2010, we employed 104,490 persons of whom 57,171 were located outside the United States. From a global enterprise perspective, we believe our relationship with our employees is very good. We build and maintain a productive, motivated workforce by striving to treat all employees fairly and equitably.  In the United States, most of our 47,319 employees are at-will employees and, therefore, not subject to any type of employment contract or agreement. At select business units, certain highly specialized employees have been hired under employment contracts that specify a term of employment and specify pay and other benefits.  As of December 31, 2010, there were 12,496 U.S. hourly production employees who were covered by collective bargaining agreements with various labor unions. The United Automobile, Aerospace and Agricultural Implement Workers of America represents 9,423 Caterpillar employees under a six-year central labor agreement that expires on March 1, 2011 and that we are currently in the process of renegotiating. The International Association of Machinists represents 1,814 employees under labor agreements that will expire on April 30, 2012 and May 17, 2015.  Outside the United States, the company enters into employment contracts and agreements in those countries in which such relationships are mandatory or customary. The provisions of these agreements correspond in each case with the required or customary terms in the subject jurisdiction.  Sales  Sales outside the United States were 68 percent of consolidated sales for 2010, 69 percent for 2009 and 67 percent for 2008.  Environmental Matters  The company is regulated by federal, state and international environmental laws governing our use, transport and disposal of substances and control of emissions. In addition to governing our manufacturing and other operations, these laws often impact the development of our products, including, but not limited to, required compliance with air emissions standards applicable to internal combustion engines. Compliance with these existing laws has not had a material impact on our capital expenditures, earnings or global competitive position.  We are engaged in remedial activities at a number of locations, often with other companies, pursuant to federal and state laws. When it is reasonably probable we will pay remedial costs at a site, and those costs can be reasonably estimated, the costs are charged against our earnings. In formulating that estimate, we do not consider amounts expected to be recovered from insurance companies or others. The amount recorded for environmental remediation is not material and is included in the line item Accrued expenses in Statement 2  Consolidated Financial Position at December 31 of Exhibit 13.  We cannot reasonably estimate costs at sites in the very early stages of remediation. Currently, we have a few sites in the very early stages of remediation, and there is no more than a remote chance that a material amount for remedial activities at any individual site, or at all sites in the aggregate, will be required.

Risk Factors.  The statements in this section describe the most significant risks to our business and should be considered carefully in conjunction with Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements of Exhibit 13 to this Form 10-K. In addition, the statements in this section include forward-looking statements as that term is defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. The discussion and analysis contained in the Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and other items in this Form 10-K are forward-looking and involve uncertainties that could significantly impact results. From time to time, we also provide forward-looking statements in oral presentations to the public or in other materials we issue to the public. Forward-looking statements give current expectations or forecasts of future events about the company or our outlook. You can identify these statements by the fact they do not relate to historical or current facts and by the use of words such as believe, expect, estimate, anticipate, will be, should, plan, project, intend, could and similar words or expressions that identify forward-looking statements made on behalf of Caterpillar.  In particular, these forward-looking statements include statements relating to future actions, prospective products, product approvals, future performance or results of current and anticipated products, sales efforts, expenses, interest rates, foreign exchange rates, the outcome of contingencies, economic conditions, potential returns, financial condition and financial results. Such statements are based on assumptions and on known risks and uncertainties. Although we believe we have been prudent in our assumptions, any or all of our forward-looking statements may prove to be inaccurate, and we can make no guarantees about our future performance. Achievement of future results is subject to risks, uncertainties and potentially inaccurate assumptions. Should known or unknown risks or uncertainties materialize or underlying assumptions prove inaccurate, actual results could materially differ from past results and/or those anticipated, estimated or projected. Uncertainties include factors that affect international businesses, as well as matters specific to the company and the markets it serves.  The company undertakes no obligation to publicly update forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. You may, however, consult any related disclosures we make in subsequent Form 10-Q or Form 8-K filings with the SEC.  The following is a cautionary discussion of risks, uncertainties and assumptions that we believe are significant to our business. In addition to the factors discussed elsewhere in this report, the following are some of the important factors that, individually or in the aggregate, we believe could make our actual results differ materially from those described in any forward-looking statements. You should note it is impossible to predict or identify all such factors and, as a result, you should not consider the following factors to be a complete discussion of risks and uncertainties.  Our business is highly sensitive to global economic conditions and economic conditions in the industries and markets we serve.  Our results of operations are materially affected by the conditions in the global economy generally and various capital markets. The demand for our products and services tends to be cyclical and can be significantly reduced in an economic environment characterized by higher unemployment, lower consumer spending, lower corporate earnings and lower levels of government and business investment.  The energy and mining industries are major users of our machines and engines. Decisions to purchase our machines and engines are dependent upon the performance of the industries in which our customers operate. If demand or output in these industries increases, the demand for our products would likely increase. Likewise, if demand or output in these industries declines, the demand for our products would likely decrease. Prices of commodities in these industries are frequently volatile and change in response to general economic conditions, economic growth, commodity inventories and any disruptions in production. We assume certain prices for key commodities in preparing the general economic and financial outlooks we disclose each quarter (our   outlooks). Commodity prices lower than those assumed in our outlooks may negatively impact our business, results of operations and financial condition.  The rates of infrastructure spending, housing starts and commercial construction play a significant role in our results. Our products are an integral component of these activities, and as these activities increase or decrease inside or outside of the United States, demand for our products may be significantly impacted, which could negatively impact our results. Slower rates of economic growth than anticipated in our outlooks could also adversely impact our business, results of operations and financial condition.  Changes in government monetary or fiscal policies may negatively impact our results .  Most countries have established central banks to regulate monetary systems and influence economic activities, generally by adjusting interest rates. Interest rate changes affect overall economic growth, which affects demand for residential and nonresidential structures, energy and mined products, which in turn affects sales of our products that serve these activities. Interest rate changes also affect customers abilities to finance machine purchases, can change the optimal time to keep machines in a fleet and can impact the ability of our suppliers to finance the production of parts and components necessary to manufacture and support our products. Our outlooks typically include assumptions about interest rates in a number of countries. Interest rates higher than those contained in our assumptions could result in lower sales than anticipated and supply chain inefficiencies.  Economic events have reduced the availability of liquidity to fund investments in many markets that we serve. Central banks and other policy arms of many countries have implemented various actions to restore liquidity and increase the availability of credit. The continuing effectiveness of these and related government actions is uncertain and could have an impact on the customers and markets we serve and our business, results of operations and financial condition.  Government policies on taxes and spending affect our business. Throughout the world, government spending finances much infrastructure development, such as highways, airports, sewer and water systems and dams. Tax regulations determine depreciation lives and the amount of money users of our products can retain, both of which influence investment decisions. Unfavorable developments, such as declines in government revenues, decisions to reduce public spending or increases in taxes, could negatively impact our results.  Commodity or component price increases and significant shortages of component products may adversely impact our financial results or our ability to meet commitments to customers.  We are a significant user of steel and many other commodities required for the manufacture of our products. As a result, unanticipated increases in the prices of such commodities would increase our costs more than expected, negatively impacting our business, results of operations and financial condition if we are unable to fully offset the effect of these increased costs through price increases, productivity improvements or cost reduction programs.  We rely on suppliers to secure component products, particularly steel, required for the manufacture of our products. During the global economic downturn, we reduced our own production levels and, as a result, our suppliers experienced significant decreases in demand for their products. Although we monitor the ability of key suppliers to ramp up production in the event that demand continues to grow, we cannot guarantee that they will be able to timely increase production to meet our demands. A disruption in deliveries to or from suppliers or decreased availability of such components or commodities could have an adverse effect on our ability to meet our commitments to customers or increase our operating costs. We believe our sources of raw materials and component products will generally be sufficient for our needs in the foreseeable future. However, our business, results of operations or financial condition could be negatively impacted if supply is insufficient for our operations.  Disruptions or volatility in global financial markets could limit our sources of liquidity, or the liquidity of our customers, dealers and suppliers.  Global economic conditions may cause volatility and disruptions in the capital and credit markets. During the 2008-2009 global economic downturn, financial markets decreased the availability of liquidity, credit and credit capacity for certain issuers, including certain of our customers, dealers and suppliers. Although we generally generate funds from our operations to pay our operating expenses, fund our capital expenditures, buy back stock, pay dividends and fund our employee retirement benefit programs, continuing to meet these cash requirements over the long-term requires substantial liquidity and access to sources of funds, including capital and credit markets. Changes in global economic conditions, including material cost increases and decreases in economic activity in many of the markets that we serve, and the success of plans to manage cost increases, inventory and other important elements of our business may significantly impact our ability to generate funds from operations. Market volatility, changes in counterparty credit risk, the impact of government intervention in financial markets and general economic conditions may also adversely impact our ability to access capital and credit markets to fund operating needs. An inability to access capital and credit markets may have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and competitive position.   In addition, the global demand for our products generally depends on our customers ability to pay for our products, which, in turn, depends on their access to funds. Subject to global economic conditions, many of our customers may experience increased difficulty in generating funds from operations. Further, following capital and credit market volatility and uncertainty, many financial institutions have revised their lending standards, thereby decreasing access to capital. If capital and credit market volatility occurs, the liquidity of our customers may decline which, in turn, would reduce their ability to purchase our products.  Our global operations are exposed to political and economic risks, commercial instability and events beyond our control in the countries in which we operate.  Our global operations are dependent upon products manufactured, purchased and sold in the U.S. and internationally, including in countries with political and economic instability. In some cases, these countries have greater political and economic volatility and greater vulnerability to infrastructure and labor disruptions than in our other markets. Operating and seeking to expand business in a number of different regions and countries exposes us to a number of risks, including:    multiple and potentially conflicting laws, regulations and policies that are subject to change;    imposition of currency restrictions, restrictions on repatriation of earnings or other restraints;    imposition of burdensome tariffs or quotas;    national and international conflict, including terrorist acts; and    political and economic instability or civil unrest that may severely disrupt economic activity in affected countries.  The occurrence of one or more of these events may negatively impact our business, results of operations and financial condition.  Failure to maintain our credit ratings would increase our cost of borrowing and could adversely affect our access to capital markets.  Caterpillars and Cat Financials costs of borrowing and ability to access the capital markets are affected not only by market conditions but also by the short- and long-term debt ratings assigned to their debt by the major credit rating agencies. These ratings are based, in significant part, on Caterpillars and Cat Financials performance as measured by financial metrics such as net worth and interest coverage and leverage ratios, as well as transparency with rating agencies and timeliness of financial reporting. In 2009, each of the major credit rating agencies either modified their outlook for the company and Cat Financial or downgraded the rating. While the rating agencies subsequently improved their outlooks to stable, there can be no assurance that Caterpillars or Cat Financials credit ratings will not be lowered in the future.  Although the company and Cat Financial have committed credit facilities to provide liquidity, any downgrades of our credit ratings may increase our cost of borrowing and could have an adverse effect on our access to the capital markets, including restricting, in whole or in part, our access to the commercial paper market. There can be no assurance that the commercial paper market will continue to be a reliable source of short-term financing for the company. An inability to access the capital markets could have a material adverse effect on our cash flow, results of operations and financial condition.  Our Financial Products line of business is subject to risks associated with the financial services industry.  Difficult and volatile market conditions may have an adverse effect upon the financial industry in which Cat Financial operates. Cat Financial is significant to our operations and provides financing support to a significant share of our global sales. The inability of Cat Financial to access funds to support its financing activities to our customers could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.  Inherent in the operation of Cat Financial is the credit risk associated with its customers. The creditworthiness of each customer and the rate of delinquencies, repossessions and net losses on customer obligations are directly impacted by several factors, including relevant industry and economic conditions, the availability of capital, the experience and expertise of the customers management team, commodity prices, political events and the sustained value of the underlying collateral.  Changes in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and market liquidity conditions could have a material adverse effect on Cat Financials and our earnings and cash flows. Because a significant number of the loans made by Cat Financial are made at fixed interest rates, its business is subject to fluctuations in interest rates. Changes in market interest rates may influence its financing costs, returns on financial investments and the valuation of derivative contracts and could reduce its and our earnings and cash flows. In addition, because Cat Financial makes a significant number of loans in currencies other than the U.S. dollar, fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could also reduce its and our earnings and cash flows. Although Cat Financial manages interest rate, foreign currency exchange rate and market liquidity risks through a variety of techniques, including a match funding program, the selective use of derivatives and a broadly diversified funding program, there can be no assurance that fluctuations in interest rates, currency exchange rates and market liquidity conditions will not have a material adverse effect on its and our earnings and cash flows. If any of the variety of instruments and strategies Cat Financial uses to hedge its exposure to these various types of risk is ineffective, we may incur losses. With respect to Cat Insurances investment activities, changes in the   equity and bond markets could cause an impairment of the value of its investment portfolio, requiring a negative adjustment to earnings.  The U.S. Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act was signed into law in July 2010 and includes extensive provisions regulating the financial services industry. The impact of this legislation remains uncertain, as regulators continue to propose and adopt implementing rules. If the rules, as adopted, impose significant costs or restrictions on the company, including, without limitation, costs or restrictions on our or Cat Financials use of derivatives or asset backed securitizations, we could experience an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.  Cat Financial relies on a number of diversified global debt markets and funding programs to provide liquidity for its global operations, including commercial paper, medium term notes, retail notes, variable denomination floating rate demand notes, asset-backed securitizations and bank loans. Significant changes in market liquidity conditions could impact Cat Financials access to funding, increase the associated funding costs and reduce its and our earnings and cash flows. A large portion of Cat Financials borrowings have been issued in the medium term note and commercial paper markets. While Cat Financial has maintained access to key global medium term note and commercial paper markets, there can be no assurance that such markets will continue to represent a reliable source of financing for Cat Financial. Should global economic conditions deteriorate or access to debt markets be reduced, Cat Financial could experience materially higher financing costs and become unable to access adequate funding to operate and grow its business and/or meet its debt service obligations as they mature, or it could be required to draw upon contractually committed lending agreements primarily provided by global banks and/or by seeking other funding sources. However, under extreme market conditions, there can be no assurance such agreements and other funding sources would be available or sufficient. Any of these events could negatively impact Cat Financials business, results of operations and financial condition. The extent of any impact on our ability to meet funding or liquidity needs would depend on several factors, including our operating cash flows, the duration of any future market disruptions, the effects of governmental intervention in the financial markets including the effects of any programs or legislation designed to increase or restrict liquidity for certain areas of the market, general credit conditions, the volatility of equity and debt markets, our credit ratings and credit capacity and the cost of financing and other general economic and business conditions.  Market disruption and volatility may also lead to a number of other risks, including:    Market developments that may affect customer confidence levels and cause declines in the demand for financing and adverse changes in payment patterns, causing increases in delinquencies and default rates, which could impact Cat Financials write-offs and provision for credit losses.    The process Cat Financial uses to estimate losses inherent in its credit exposure requires a high degree of managements judgment regarding numerous subjective qualitative factors, including forecasts of economic conditions and how economic predictors might impair the ability of its borrowers to repay their loans. Financial market disruption and volatility may impact the accuracy of these judgments.    Cat Financials ability to engage in routine funding transactions or borrow from other financial institutions on acceptable terms or at all could be adversely affected by disruptions in the capital markets or other events, including actions by rating agencies and deteriorating investor expectations.    As Cat Financials counterparties are primarily financial institutions, their ability to perform in accordance with any of its underlying agreements could be adversely affected by market volatility and/or disruptions in financial markets.  We engage in acquisitions and divestitures, including the recently announced acquisition of Bucyrus; we may not realize all of the anticipated benefits of these transactions or these benefits may take longer to realize than expected.  From time to time we engage in strategic transactions involving risks, including the possible failure to successfully integrate and realize the expected benefits of such transactions. On November 14, 2010, we entered into an agreement to acquire Bucyrus, subject to the satisfaction or waiver of certain closing conditions and regulatory approvals. If the merger with Bucyrus is consummated, the combined companys ability to realize the anticipated benefits of the merger, including the expected synergies and cost savings, will depend, to a large extent, on our ability to integrate the mining businesses of both companies. Our management will be required to devote significant attention and resources to this integration process, which may disrupt the business of either or both of the companies and, if implemented ineffectively, could preclude realization of the full benefits we expect. Failure to successfully integrate the operations of the Caterpillar and Bucyrus mining businesses or otherwise to realize the anticipated benefits of the merger could cause an interruption of, or a loss of momentum in, the mining operations of the combined company. In addition, the integration may result in material unanticipated problems, expenses, liabilities, competitive responses, loss of customer relationships, and the diversion of managements attention, and may cause our stock price to decline. The risks associated with the Bucyrus acquisition and our other past or future acquisitions include:     The business culture of the acquired business may not match well with our culture;    Technological and product synergies, economies of scale and cost reductions may not occur as expected;    Unforeseen expenses, delays or conditions may be imposed upon the acquisition, including due to required regulatory approvals or consents;    The company may acquire or assume unexpected liabilities;    Faulty assumptions may be made regarding the integration process;    Unforeseen difficulties may arise in integrating operations and systems;    The company may fail to retain, motivate and integrate key management and other employees of the acquired business;    Higher than expected finance costs may arise due to unforeseen changes in tax, trade, environmental, labor, safety, payroll or pension policies in any jurisdiction in which the acquired business conducts its operations; and    The company may experience problems in retaining customers and integrating customer bases.  Many of these factors will be outside of the combined companys control and any one of them could result in increased costs, decreases in the amount of expected revenues and diversion of managements time and energy. With respect to the Bucyrus acquisition specifically, it is possible that regulators will impose conditions on required antitrust approvals, including by requiring dispositions. Even if the mining businesses are successfully integrated, the combined company may not realize the full benefits of the transaction, including the synergies, cost savings or sales or growth opportunities that the combined company expects. These benefits may not be achieved within the anticipated time frame, or at all. If we fail to complete the Bucyrus acquisition or to achieve the anticipated benefits of the acquisition, this could have an adverse effect on the market price of our common stock.  In addition, in order to conserve cash for operations, we may undertake acquisitions financed in part through public offerings or private placements of debt or equity securities, or other arrangements. In connection with the announcement of the Bucyrus acquisition, we announced that we intend to issue debt and equity securities to fund the acquisition of Bucyrus. Such acquisition financing could result in a decrease of our ratio of earnings to fixed charges and adversely affect other leverage measures. If we issue equity securities or equity-linked securities, the issued securities may have a dilutive effect on the interests of the holders of our common shares.  Failure to implement the companys acquisition strategy, including successfully integrating acquired businesses, could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Furthermore, we make strategic divestitures from time to time. These divestitures may result in continued financial involvement in the divested businesses, including through guarantees or other financial arrangements, following the transaction. Lower performance by those divested businesses could affect our future financial results.  International trade policies may impact demand for our products and our competitive position.  Government policies on international trade and investment such as import quotas, capital controls or tariffs, whether adopted by individual governments or addressed by regional trade blocs, can affect the demand for our products and services, impact the competitive position of our products or prevent us from being able to sell products in certain countries. The implementation of more restrictive trade policies, such as more detailed inspections, higher tariffs or new barriers to entry, in countries in which we sell large quantities of products and services could negatively impact our business, results of operations and financial condition. For example, a governments adoption of buy national policies or retaliation by another government against such policies could have a negative impact on our results of operations.  Our introduction of Tier 4 emissions compliant machines and engines may not be successful.  The EPA has adopted new and more stringent emission standards, including Tier 4 nonroad diesel emission requirements applicable to the majority of our nonroad machinery and engine products commencing in 2011. We previously announced our intent to make our nonroad engines compliant with the new emission standards, including the Tier 4 emission requirements, by the stated deadline. We intend to use certain technology with state of the art integrated systems, as well as the transitional provisions provided by the regulations in order to comply with the Tier 4 emissions requirements.  Although we are executing comprehensive plans designed to meet Tier 4 emissions requirements, these plans are subject to many variables, including the timing of our Tier 4 engine development and new machine product introduction. If we are unable to meet our plans as projected, it could delay or inhibit our ability to continue placing certain products on the market, which could negatively impact our financial results and competitive position. We are incurring research and development costs to design and introduce products to meet Tier 4 requirements. We plan to include costs associated with Tier 4 development and production in   prices of our products. The level of market acceptance of prices for products that meet Tier 4 requirements could negatively impact our financial results and competitive position.  The success of our business depends on our ability to develop, produce and market quality products that meet our customers needs.  Our business relies on continued global demand for our brands and products. To achieve business goals, we must develop and sell products that appeal to our dealers, OEMs and customers. This is dependent on a number of factors, including our ability to manage and maintain key dealer relationships, our ability to produce products that meet the quality expectations of our customers and our ability to develop effective sales, advertising and marketing programs. In addition, our continued success in selling products that appeal to our customers is dependent on leading-edge innovation, with respect to both products and operations, and on the availability and effectiveness of legal protection for our innovation. Failure to continue to deliver quality and competitive products to the marketplace, to adequately protect our intellectual property rights, to supply products that meet applicable regulatory requirements or to predict market demands for, or gain market acceptance of, our products, could have a negative impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition.  We operate in a highly competitive environment, which could adversely affect our sales and pricing .  We operate in a highly competitive environment, and our outlook depends on a forecast of the companys share of industry sales based on our ability to compete with others in the marketplace. The company competes on the basis of product performance, customer service, quality and price. There can be no assurance that our products will be able to compete successfully with other companies. Thus, our share of industry sales could be reduced due to aggressive pricing or product strategies pursued by competitors, unanticipated product or manufacturing difficulties, our failure to price our products competitively, our failure to produce our products at a competitive cost or an unexpected buildup in competitors new machine or dealer-owned rental fleets, leading to severe downward pressure on machine rental rates and/or used equipment prices.  The environment remains competitive from a pricing standpoint. Our sales outlook assumes certain price increases that we announce from time to time will hold in the marketplace. Changes in market acceptance of price increases, changes in market requirements for price discounts or changes in our competitors behavior could have an adverse impact on the companys business, results of operations and financial condition.  In addition, our results and ability to compete may be impacted positively or negatively by changes in our sales mix. Our outlook assumes a certain geographic mix of sales as well as a product mix of sales. If actual results vary from this projected geographic and product mix of sales, our results could be negatively impacted.  Union disputes or other employee relations issues could adversely affect our operations and financial results .  Some of our employees are represented by labor unions in a number of countries under various collective bargaining agreements with varying durations and expiration dates. While we do not expect to be impacted by employee relations issues, there can be no assurance that future issues with our employees will be resolved or that we will not encounter future strikes, work stoppages or other types of conflicts with labor unions or our employees. We may not be able to satisfactorily renegotiate collective bargaining agreements in the United States and other countries when they expire, including the master collective bargaining agreement with the United Automobile, Aerospace and Agricultural Implement Workers, which is scheduled to expire on March 1, 2011. If we fail to renegotiate our existing collective bargaining agreements, we could encounter strikes or work stoppages or other types of conflicts with labor unions. In addition, existing collective bargaining agreements may not prevent a strike or work stoppage at our facilities in the future. We may also be subject to general country strikes or work stoppages unrelated to our business or collective bargaining agreements. Any such work stoppages (or potential work stoppages) could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.  We may not realize all of the anticipated benefits from the implementation of the Caterpillar Production System (CPS) or other productivity initiatives.  CPS is a significant productivity initiative that aims to improve our order-to-delivery processes and factory efficiency, as well as to reduce waste and maximize value for our customers. Inability or failure to implement and utilize CPS or other productivity initiatives could have an adverse impact on our business and our results of operations. There can be no assurance that this initiative or others will be beneficial to the extent anticipated, or that the estimated cost savings will be realized.  Our business is subject to the sourcing practices of our dealers and our Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) customers.  We sell finished products through an independent dealer network and directly to OEMs. Both carry inventories of finished products as part of ongoing operations and adjust those inventories based on their assessments of future needs. Such adjustments can impact our results either positively or negatively. In particular, some of our engine customers are OEMs that manufacture or could in the future manufacture engines for their own products. Despite their engine manufacturing abilities, these customers have chosen to outsource certain types of engine production to us due to the quality of our engine products and in order to reduce costs, eliminate production risks and maintain company focus. However, we cannot assure that these customers will continue to   outsource engine manufacture in the future. Decreased levels of production outsourcing by these customers could result from a number of factors, such as shifts in our customers business strategies, acquisition by a customer of another engine manufacturer, the inability of third-party suppliers to meet specifications and the emergence of low-cost production opportunities in foreign countries. A significant reduction in the level of engine production outsourcing from our OEM customers could significantly impact our revenues and, accordingly, have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.  We are subject to stringent environmental laws and regulations that impose significant compliance costs.  Our facilities, operations and products are subject to increasingly stringent environmental laws and regulations, including laws and regulations governing emissions to air, discharges to water and the generation, handling, storage, transportation, treatment and disposal of non-hazardous and hazardous waste materials. While we believe we are in compliance in all material respects with these environmental laws and regulations, we cannot provide assurances that we will not be adversely affected by costs, liabilities or claims with respect to existing or subsequently acquired operations or under present laws and regulations or those that may be adopted or imposed in the future.  In particular, our engines are subject to extensive statutory and regulatory requirements governing exhaust emissions and noise, including standards imposed by the EPA, state regulatory agencies in the United States and other regulatory agencies around the world. For instance, national, state or local governments may set new emissions standards that could impact our products and operations in ways that are difficult to anticipate with accuracy. Thus, significant changes in standards, or the adoption of new standards, have the potential to negatively impact our business, results of operations, financial condition and competitive position.  Our global operations are subject to extensive trade and anti-corruption laws and regulations.  Due to the international scope of our operations, we are subject to a complex system of import- and export-related laws and regulations, including U.S. regulations issued by Customs and Border Protection, the Bureau of Industry and Security, the Office of Antiboycott Compliance, the Directorate of Defense Trade Controls and the Office of Foreign Assets Control, as well as the counterparts of these agencies in other countries. Any alleged or actual violations may subject us to government scrutiny, investigation and civil and criminal penalties, and may limit our ability to import or export our products or to provide services outside the United States. We cannot predict the nature, scope or effect of future regulatory requirements to which our operations might be subject or the manner in which existing laws might be administered or interpreted.  In addition, the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and similar foreign anti-corruption laws generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments or providing anything of value to improperly influence foreign government officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business, or obtaining an unfair advantage. Recent years have seen a substantial increase in the global enforcement of anti-corruption laws. Our continued operation and expansion outside the United States, including in developing countries, could increase the risk of such violations. Violations of these laws may result in severe criminal or civil sanctions, could disrupt our business, and result in a material adverse effect on our reputation, business and results of operations or financial condition.  Moreover, several of our joint venture partners are domiciled in areas of the world with laws, rules and business practices that differ from those in the United States. Although we strive to select joint venture partners who share our values and understand our reporting requirements as a U.S.-domiciled company and to ensure that an appropriate business culture exists within these ventures to minimize and mitigate our risk, we nonetheless face the reputational and legal risk that our joint venture partners will violate applicable laws, rules and business practices.  We may incur additional tax expense or become subject to additional tax exposure.  We are subject to income taxes in the United States and numerous foreign jurisdictions, and our domestic and international tax liabilities are dependent upon the distribution of income among these different jurisdictions. Our provision for income taxes and cash tax liability in the future could be adversely affected by numerous factors, including income before taxes being lower than anticipated in countries with lower statutory tax rates and higher than anticipated in countries with higher statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities and changes in tax laws and regulations. We are also subject to the continuous examination of our income tax returns by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities. The results of audits and examinations of previously filed tax returns and continuing assessments of our tax exposures may have an adverse effect on the companys provision for income taxes and cash tax liability.  Currency exchange rate fluctuations affect our results of operations, as reported in our financial statements.  We conduct operations in many areas of the world, involving transactions denominated in a variety of currencies. We are subject to currency exchange rate risk to the extent that our costs are denominated in currencies other than those in which we earn revenues. In addition, because our financial statements are denominated in U.S. dollars, changes in currency exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and other currencies have had, and will continue to have, an impact on our results of operations. While we customarily enter into financial transactions to address these risks, there can be no assurance that currency exchange rate fluctuations will not adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. In addition, while the use of   currency hedging instruments may provide us with protection from adverse fluctuations in currency exchange rates, by utilizing these instruments we potentially forego the benefits that might result from favorable fluctuations in currency exchange rates.  We also face risks arising from the imposition of exchange controls and currency devaluations. Exchange controls may limit our ability to convert foreign currencies into U.S. dollars or to remit dividends and other payments by our foreign subsidiaries or businesses located in or conducted within a country imposing controls. Currency devaluations result in a diminished value of funds denominated in the currency of the country instituting the devaluation.  Restrictive covenants in our debt agreements could limit our financial and operating flexibility.  We maintain a number of credit facilities to support (i) our commercial paper program and (ii) general corporate purposes (facilities) and have issued debt securities to manage liquidity and fund operations (debt securities). The agreements relating to a number of the facilities and the debt securities contain certain restrictive covenants applicable to us and certain of our subsidiaries, including Cat Financial. These covenants include maintaining a consolidated net worth (defined as the consolidated stockholders equity including preferred stock but excluding the pension and other post-retirement benefits balance within accumulated other comprehensive income (loss)) of not less than $9 billion, limitations on the incurrence of liens and certain restrictions on consolidation and merger. Cat Financial has also agreed under certain of these agreements to maintain a leverage ratio (consolidated debt to consolidated net worth, calculated (1) on a monthly basis as the average of the leverage ratios determined on the last day of each of the six preceding calendar months and (2) at each December 31) not greater than 10.0 to 1, to maintain a minimum interest coverage ratio (profit excluding income taxes, interest expense and net gain/(loss) from interest rate derivatives to interest expense, calculated at the end of each calendar quarter for the rolling four quarter period then most recently ended) of not less than 1.15 to 1 and not to terminate, amend or modify its support agreement with us.  Although we do not believe any of these covenants presently materially restrict our operations, a breach of one or more of the covenants could result in adverse consequences that could negatively impact our business, results of operations and financial condition. These consequences may include the acceleration of amounts outstanding under certain of the facilities, triggering of an obligation to redeem certain debt securities, termination of existing unused commitments by our lenders, refusal by our lenders to extend further credit under one or more of the facilities or to enter into new facilities or the lowering or modification of our credit ratings or those of one or more of our subsidiaries.  In 2008, we received the consent of lenders under certain of our facilities to our lower consolidated net worth of $6.087 billion as of December 31, 2008 and to Cat Financials lower quarterly interest coverage ratio of 0.97 as of December 31, 2008. In consideration of these consents, we agreed to increase the upper range of interest rates applicable to amounts that may be drawn by us and Cat Financial under certain of our facilities.  Sustained increases in funding obligations under our pension plans may reduce our profitability.  We maintain certain defined benefit pension plans for our employees, which impose on us certain funding obligations. In determining our future payment obligations under the plans, we assume certain rates of return on the plan assets and growth rates of certain costs. Significant adverse changes in credit or capital markets could result in actual rates of return being materially lower than projected and increased pension expense in future years. We may be required to make contributions to our pension plans in the future, and these contributions could be material. Our cost growth rates may also be materially higher than projected. These factors could significantly increase our payment obligations under the plans, require us to take a significant charge on our balance sheet and, as a result, adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.  Costs associated with lawsuits or increases in the reserves we establish based on our assessment of contingencies may have an adverse effect on our results of operations.  We face an inherent business risk of exposure to various types of claims and lawsuits. We are involved in various intellectual property, product liability, product warranty and environmental claims and lawsuits and other legal proceedings that arise in and outside of the ordinary course of our business. Although it is not possible to predict with certainty the outcome of every claim and lawsuit, we believe these lawsuits and claims will not individually or in the aggregate have a material impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition. However, we could in the future incur judgments or enter into settlements of lawsuits and claims that could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition in any particular period. In addition, while we maintain insurance coverage with respect to certain claims, we may not be able to obtain such insurance on acceptable terms in the future, if at all, and any such insurance may not provide adequate coverage against any such claims.   As required by U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), we establish reserves based on our assessment of contingencies, including contingencies related to legal claims asserted against us. Subsequent developments in legal proceedings may affect our assessment and estimates of the loss contingency recorded as a reserve and require us to make additional material payments, which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations.  National governments or inter-governmental organizations may impose carbon emissions regulations.  The potential for government-mandated reductions of carbon emissions from our facilities and products is increasing. Mandatory reductions being considered by many jurisdictions may take the form of new legislation and/or regulations. For example, in the United States, the EPA has stated that it plans to promulgate regulations governing carbon emissions from automobiles, which may lead to regulation of other mobile sources, as well as stationary sources. Additionally, the American Clean Energy and Security Act has passed the U.S. House of Representatives, and similar legislation has been introduced in the U.S. Senate. This legislation is also designed to restrict and reduce carbon emissions from U.S. stationary and mobile sources. The final details and scope of these legislative and regulatory measures are unclear and their potential impact is still uncertain, so we cannot fully predict the impact on the company. Should final legislation or regulations be adopted imposing significant operational restrictions and compliance requirements upon us or our products, they could negatively impact the companys capital expenditures, results of operations and competitive position.  Changes in accounting guidance could have an adverse effect on our results of operations, as reported in our financial statements.  Our financial statements are prepared in accordance with GAAP, which is periodically revised and/or expanded. Accordingly, from time to time we are required to adopt new or revised accounting guidance issued by recognized authoritative bodies, including the Financial Accounting Standards Board. Market conditions have prompted accounting guidance setters to issue new guidance that further interprets or seeks to revise accounting pronouncements related to various transactions as well as to issue new guidance expanding disclosures. The impact of accounting pronouncements that have been issued but not yet implemented is disclosed in our annual and quarterly reports on Form 10-K and Form 10-Q. An assessment of proposed standards is not provided, as such proposals are subject to change through the exposure process and, therefore, their effects on our financial statements cannot be meaningfully assessed. It is possible that future accounting guidance we are required to adopt could change the current accounting treatment that we apply to our consolidated financial statements and that such changes could have an adverse effect on our results of operations, as reported in our consolidated financial statements.  Unexpected events, including natural disasters, may increase our cost of doing business or disrupt our operations.  The occurrence of one or more unexpected events, including fires, tornadoes, hurricanes, earthquakes, floods and other forms of severe weather in the United States or in other countries in which we operate or in which our suppliers are located could adversely affect our operations and financial performance. Natural disasters, pandemic illness, equipment failures, power outages or other unexpected events could result in physical damage to and complete or partial closure of one or more of our manufacturing facilities or distribution centers, temporary or long-term disruption in the supply of component products from some local and international suppliers, disruption in the transport of our products to dealers and end-users and delay in the delivery of our products to our distribution centers. Existing insurance arrangements may not provide protection for all of the costs that may arise from such events.  ", "1B": " Item 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments as of December 31, 2010.  None.

Properties.  General Information  Caterpillars operations are highly integrated. Although the majority of our plants are involved primarily in production relating to our Machinery or Engines lines of business, several plants are involved in manufacturing relating to both lines of business. In addition, several plants are involved in the manufacturing of components which are used in the assembly of both machines and engines. Caterpillars parts distribution centers are involved in the storage and distribution of parts for machines and engines. Also, the research and development activities carried on at our Technical Center in Mossville, Illinois involve both machines and engines.  We believe the properties we own to be generally well maintained and adequate for present use. Through planned capital expenditures, we expect these properties to remain adequate for future needs. Properties we lease are covered by leases expiring over terms of generally one to ten years. We do not anticipate any difficulty in retaining occupancy of any leased facilities, either by renewing leases prior to expiration or by replacing them with equivalent leased facilities.  Headquarters and Other Key Offices  Our corporate headquarters are in Peoria, Illinois. Additional marketing and operating headquarters are located both inside and outside the United States including Miami, Florida; San Diego, California; Geneva, Switzerland; Beijing, China; Singapore, Republic of Singapore; Piracicaba, Brazil and Tokyo, Japan. The Financial Products Division is headquartered in leased offices located in Nashville, Tennessee.  Parts Distribution Centers  Distribution of our parts is conducted from parts distribution centers inside and outside the United States. Cat Logistics distributes other companies products, using both Caterpillar and non-Caterpillar facilities located both inside and outside the United States. We also own or lease other storage facilities that support distribution activities.  Technical Center, Training Centers, Demonstration Areas and Proving Grounds  We own a Technical Center located in Mossville, Illinois, and various other technical and training centers, demonstration areas and proving grounds located both inside and outside the United States.  Manufacturing, Remanufacturing and Overhaul  Manufacturing, remanufacturing and overhaul of our products are conducted primarily at the following locations. These facilities are believed to be suitable for their intended purposes with adequate capacities for current and projected needs for existing products. As discussed under Item 1.

Legal Proceedings.  We have disclosed certain individual legal proceedings in this filing. Additionally, we are involved in other unresolved legal actions that arise in the normal course of business. The most prevalent of these unresolved actions involve disputes related to product design, manufacture and performance liability (including claimed asbestos and welding fumes exposure), contracts, employment issues or intellectual property rights. Although it is not possible to predict with certainty the outcome of these unresolved legal actions, we believe that these actions will not individually or in the aggregate have a material adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations, financial position or liquidity.  On May 14, 2007, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) issued a Notice of Violation to Caterpillar alleging various violations of Clean Air Act Sections 203, 206 and 207. EPA claims that Caterpillar violated such sections by shipping engines and catalytic converter after-treatment devices separately, introducing into commerce a number of uncertified and/or misbuilt engines, and failing to timely report emissions-related defects. Caterpillar is currently engaged in negotiations with EPA and the U.S. Department of Justice to resolve these issues. On July 9, 2010, the Department of Justice issued a penalty demand to Caterpillar seeking a civil penalty of $3.2 million and implementation of injunctive relief involving expanded use of certain technologies. Caterpillar continues to cooperate with EPA and the Department of Justice and, while penalties will likely exceed $100,000, management does not believe that this issue will have a material adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations, financial position or liquidity.  On February 8, 2009, an incident at Caterpillars Joliet, Illinois facility resulted in the release of approximately 3,000 gallons of wastewater into the Des Plaines River. In coordination with state and federal authorities, appropriate remediation measures have been taken. On February 23, 2009, the Illinois Attorney General filed a Complaint in Will County Circuit Court containing seven counts of violations of state environmental laws and regulations. Caterpillar recently settled this matter with the State of Illinois, resolving all allegations in the Complaint. This settlement does not have a material adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations, financial position, or liquidity. In addition, on March 5, 2009, the EPA served Caterpillar with a Notice of Intent to file a Civil Administrative Action (notice), indicating the EPAs intent to seek civil penalties for alleged violations of the Clean Water Act and Oil Pollution Act. On January 25, 2010, the EPA issued a revised notice seeking civil penalties in the amount of $167,800, and Caterpillar responded to the revised notice and is engaged in follow up discussions with the EPA. At this time, we do not believe this remaining proceeding will have a material adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations, financial position or liquidity.  In May 2010, an incident at Caterpillars Gosselies, Belgium facility resulted in the release of wastewater into the Perupont River. In coordination with local authorities, appropriate remediation measures have been taken. In January 2011, Caterpillar learned that the public prosecutor for the Belgian administrative district of Charleroi had referred the matter to an examining magistrate of the civil court of Charleroi for further investigation. Caterpillar is cooperating with the Belgian authorities on this investigation. At this time, it is uncertain whether penalties will be assessed, and any penalties could potentially exceed $100,000. Management does not believe this matter will have a material adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations, financial position or liquidity.  Item 4.

Based on this evaluation, our chief executive officer and our chief financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of the end of the period covered by this annual report.  Managements Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting  The management of Caterpillar is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as such term is defined under Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f). Our internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of our financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Our internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.  Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.  Management assessed the effectiveness of the companys internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2010. In making this assessment, we used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework . Based on our assessment we concluded that, as of December 31, 2010, the companys internal control over financial reporting was effective based on those criteria.  Management has excluded Electro-Motive Diesel, Inc. (EMD) from our assessment of internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2010 because we acquired EMD in August 2010. EMD is a wholly owned subsidiary of Caterpillar Inc. whose total assets and total revenues represent approximately 2 percent and 1 percent, respectively, of the related consolidated financial statement amounts as of and for the year ended December 31, 2010.  The effectiveness of the companys internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2010 has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm. Their report appears on page A-4 of Exhibit 13.  Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting  During the last fiscal quarter, there has been no significant change in the companys internal control over financial reporting that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the companys internal control over financial reporting.

Business.  General  Originally organized as Caterpillar Tractor Co. in 1925 in the State of California, our company was reorganized as Caterpillar Inc. in 1986 in the State of Delaware. As used herein, the term Caterpillar, we, us, our, or the company refers to Caterpillar Inc. and its subsidiaries unless designated or identified otherwise.  Overview  With 2011 sales and revenues of $60.138 billion, Caterpillar is the worlds leading manufacturer of construction and mining equipment, diesel and natural gas engines, industrial gas turbines and diesel-electric locomotives. The company is also a leading services provider through Caterpillar Financial Services Corporation (Cat Financial), Caterpillar Remanufacturing Services, Caterpillar Logistics Inc. (Cat Logistics) and Progress Rail Services Corporation (Progress Rail). Caterpillar is also a leading U.S. exporter. Through a global network of independent dealers and direct sales of certain products, Caterpillar builds long-term relationships with customers around the world.  In 2010, we announced a revised strategy and reorganization of our business into strategic business units. Our reorganization was implemented in 2011 and resulted in the creation of seven operating segments, of which four are reportable segments and are described below. Further information about our reportable segments, including geographic information, appears in Note 22  Segment information of Exhibit 13.  Categories of Business Organization  1.  Machinery and Power Systems  Represents the aggregate total of Construction Industries, Resource Industries, Power Systems and All Other segments and related corporate items and eliminations.  2.  Financial Products  Primarily includes the companys Financial Products Segment. This category includes Cat Financial, Caterpillar Insurance Holdings Inc. (Cat Insurance) and their respective subsidiaries.  Other information about our operations in 2011, including certain risks associated with our operations, is incorporated by reference from our Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in Exhibit 13.  Construction Industries  Our Construction Industries segment is primarily responsible for supporting customers using machinery in infrastructure and building construction applications. The majority of machine sales in this segment are made in the heavy construction, general construction, mining and quarry and aggregates markets. As the global economy has returned to growth, demand for construction machinery increased in 2011 over 2010, especially in developing economies where new machine sales were close to or above record levels. Sales also increased in developed economies, driven primarily by the need for customers to upgrade machine fleets and replace older equipment. As we continued to ramp up production to meet demand, sales of some machines were limited by our capacity.   Customer demand for construction machinery has been characterized over the past decade by a shift from developed to developing economies. Customers in developing economies often prioritize purchase price in making their investment decisions, while customers in developed economies generally weigh productivity and other performance criteria that contribute to lower lifetime owning and operating costs of a machine. In response to increased demand in developing economies, Caterpillar has developed differentiated product offerings that target customers in those markets, including our SEM brand machines. We believe that these customer-driven product innovations enable us to compete more effectively in developing economies.  In response to customer demand and our expectations for industry growth, we are investing to increase our production of construction machinery, especially in the United States, Brazil and Asia. These investments are designed to better align our regional production capacity with customer demand. In 2011, we announced new facilities in North Carolina, Texas, China and Thailand. We also announced expansions of our existing facilities in Arkansas, Texas, Brazil and India. In addition to capacity constraints for certain machines, we experienced some supply chain constraints related to the tsunami and earthquake that struck Japan on March 11, 2011. Our employees worked closely with our suppliers, dealers and customers to mitigate the effects of this disaster and almost all negative impacts experienced in the second quarter were recovered in the second half of the year, with minimal profit impact.  The competitive environment for construction machinery is characterized by some global competitors and many regional and specialized local competitors. Examples of global competitors include Komatsu Ltd., Volvo Construction Equipment (part of the Volvo Group AB), CNH Global N.V., Deere  Co., Hitachi Construction Machinery Co., J.C. Bamford Ltd., Doosan Infracore Co., Ltd. and Hyundai. As an example of regional and local competitors, our competitors in China also include LiuGong Machinery Co., Ltd., Longking Group, Sany Heavy Industry Co., Ltd, XiaGong Machinery Co. Ltd., and XCMG Group. Each of these companies has varying product lines that compete with Caterpillar products, and each has varying degrees of regional focus.  The Construction Industries product portfolio includes the following machines and related parts:  ##TABLE_START   backhoe loaders    compact wheel loaders    medium track-type tractors   small wheel loaders    select work tools    small track-type tractors    small, medium and large track excavators    track-type loaders   skid steer loaders     motor graders   multi-terrain loaders    wheel excavators    pipelayers   mini excavators    medium wheel loaders   ##TABLE_END   Resource Industries  The Resource Industries segment is primarily responsible for supporting customers using machinery in mine and quarry applications. It also serves forestry, paving and tunneling customers. Our Resource Industries business was transformed by the acquisition of Bucyrus International, Inc. (Bucyrus) in July 2011, and now offers mining customers the broadest product range in the industry. We subsequently announced our intention to transition the Bucyrus distribution business to the independent Caterpillar dealers who support mining customers. We are expediting integration of the acquired company and working closely with our dealers to transition the distribution business.  Resource Industries sales grew significantly in 2011, both with and without the impact of Bucyrus, as our mining customers responded to attractive commodity prices and an economic environment that favored capital investment. For certain products, including large mining trucks, our sales were constrained by capacity. We have announced investments in new facilities and the expansion of existing facilities to increase capacity, including in Illinois, Kansas, North Dakota, China, India, Indonesia, Russia and Thailand. These investments reflect our belief that long-term trends of urbanization and related infrastructure development will support continued mining industry growth.  The competitive environment for Resource Industries consists of a few larger global competitors that compete in several of the markets that we serve and a substantial number of smaller companies that compete in a more limited range of products and/or applications or in regional markets. Our global competitors include Komatsu Ltd., Joy Global Inc., Hitachi Construction Machinery Co., Ltd., Volvo Construction Equipment (part of the Volvo Group AB), Atlas Copco, Wirtgen and Deere  Co.  The Resource Industries product portfolio includes the following machines and related parts:  ##TABLE_START   electric rope shovels    large mining trucks    wheel dozers   draglines    large electric drive mining trucks    compactors   hydraulic shovels    tunnel boring equipment    select work tools   drills    large wheel loaders    forestry products   highwall miners    off-highway trucks    paving products   underground mining equipment    articulated trucks    machinery components   large track-type tractors    wheel tractor scrapers    electronics and control systems ##TABLE_END  Power Systems  Our Power Systems segment is primarily responsible for supporting customers using reciprocating engines, turbines and related parts across industries serving electric power, industrial, petroleum and marine applications as well as rail-related businesses. Power Systems sales increased globally in 2011, driven by increased customer demand, and included a full year of sales by Electro-Motive Diesel, Inc. (EMD).  The Power Systems portfolio includes:   reciprocating engine powered generator sets   integrated systems used in the electric power generation industry   reciprocating engines and integrated systems and solutions for the marine and petroleum industries   reciprocating engines supplied to the industrial industry as well as Caterpillar machinery   turbines and turbine-related services   diesel-electric locomotives and components and other rail-related products and services.  As in our other segments, customer demand for most Power Systems products and services has increased significantly in the developing world, and we have announced investments to increase our production in line with regional demand. In 2011, we announced investments in engine facilities in Brazil, China and India; two new EMD manufacturing facilities commenced operations in Indiana and Mexico, and we announced plans to open an EMD manufacturing facility in   Brazil. We also see increasing customer demand for sustainable power alternatives and in October 2011 acquired MWM Holding GmbH (MWM), a leading supplier of natural gas and alternative-fuel engines. Power Systems is focused on increasing its product offerings and further integrating its products and services to provide complete systems and solutions to its customers.  Regulatory emissions standards of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and similar standards in other developed economies have required us to make significant investments in research and development that will continue as new products are phased in over the next several years. This new product introduction process is the most extensive in the companys history. We believe that our emissions technology provides a competitive advantage in connection with emissions standards compliance and performance.  The competitive environment for reciprocating engines in marine, petroleum, construction, industrial, agriculture and electric power generation systems along with turbines consists of a few larger global competitors that compete in a variety of markets that Caterpillar serves, and a substantial number of smaller companies that compete in a limited-size product range, geographic region and/or application. Principal global competitors include Cummins Inc., Tognum AG, GE Energy Infrastructure, Siemens Energy and Wartsila Corp. Other competitors, such as John Deere Power Systems, MAN Diesel  Turbo SE, Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Ltd., Volvo Penta (part of Volvo Group AB), Kawasaki Heavy Industries, multiple emerging Chinese competitors and Rolls Royce Group plc compete in certain markets in which Caterpillar competes. An additional set of competitors, including Generac Power Systems, Inc., Kohler Co., and others, are packagers who source engines and/or other components from domestic and international suppliers and market products regionally and internationally through a variety of distribution channels. In rail-related businesses, our global competitors include GE Transportation, Vossloh AG, Siemens AG and Alstom Transport. We also compete with other companies on a more limited range of products, services and/or geographic regions.  Financial Products Segment  The business of our Financial Products segment is primarily conducted by Cat Financial, a wholly owned finance subsidiary of Caterpillar. Cat Financials primary business is to provide retail and wholesale financing alternatives for Caterpillar products to customers and dealers around the world. Retail financing is primarily comprised of the financing of Caterpillar equipment, machinery and engines. Cat Financial also provides financing for vehicles, power generation facilities and marine vessels that, in most cases, incorporate Caterpillar products. In addition to retail financing, Cat Financial provides wholesale financing to Caterpillar dealers and purchases short-term receivables from Caterpillar and its subsidiaries. The various financing plans offered by Cat Financial are primarily designed to increase the opportunity for sales of Caterpillar products and generate financing income for Cat Financial. A significant portion of Cat Financials activities is conducted in North America. However, Cat Financial has additional offices and subsidiaries in Asia, Australia, Europe and Latin America.  For over 30 years, Cat Financial has been providing financing in the various markets in which it participates, contributing to its knowledge of asset values, industry trends, product structuring and customer needs.  In certain instances, Cat Financials operations are subject to supervision and regulation by state, federal and various foreign governmental authorities, and may be subject to various laws and judicial and administrative decisions imposing requirements and restrictions which, among other things, (i) regulate credit granting activities and the administration of loans, (ii) establish maximum interest rates, finance charges and other charges, (iii) require disclosures to customers and investors, (iv) govern secured transactions, (v) set collection, foreclosure, repossession and other trade practices and (vi) regulate the use and reporting of information related to a borrowers credit experience. Cat Financials ability to comply with these governmental and legal requirements and restrictions affects its operations.   Cat Financials retail leases and installment sale contracts (totaling 50 percent*) include:    Tax leases that are classified as either operating or finance leases for financial accounting purposes, depending on the characteristics of the lease. For tax purposes, Cat Financial is considered the owner of the equipment (14 percent*).    Finance (non-tax) leases, where the lessee for tax purposes is considered to be the owner of the equipment during the term of the lease, that either require or allow the customer to purchase the equipment for a fixed price at the end of the term (20 percent*).    Installment sale contracts, which are equipment loans that enable customers to purchase equipment with a down payment or trade-in and structure payments over time (15 percent*).    Governmental lease-purchase plans in the U.S. that offer low interest rates and flexible terms to qualified non-federal government agencies (1 percent*).  Cat Financials wholesale notes receivable, finance leases and installment sale contracts (totaling 18 percent*) include:    Inventory/rental programs, which provide assistance to dealers by financing their new Caterpillar inventory and rental fleets (7 percent*).    Short-term receivables we purchase from Caterpillar at a discount (11 percent*).  Cat Financials retail notes receivables (32 percent*) include:    Loans that allow customers and dealers to use their Caterpillar equipment or other assets as collateral to obtain financing.  *Indicates the percentage of Cat Financials total portfolio at December 31, 2011. We define total portfolio as total finance receivables (net of unearned income and allowance for credit losses) plus equipment on operating leases, less accumulated depreciation. For more information on the above and Cat Financials concentration of credit risk, please refer to Note 6  Cat Financial Financing Activities of Exhibit 13.  Cat Financial operates in a highly competitive environment, with financing for users of Caterpillar equipment available through a variety of sources, principally commercial banks and finance and leasing companies. Cat Financials competitors include Wells Fargo Equipment Finance Inc., General Electric Capital Corporation and various other banks and finance companies. In addition, many of our manufacturing competitors own financial subsidiaries such as Volvo Financial Services, Komatsu Financial L.P. and John Deere Capital Corporation that utilize below-market interest rate programs (subsidized by the manufacturer) to assist machine sales. Caterpillar and Cat Financial work together to provide a broad array of financial merchandising programs around the world to meet these competitive offers.  Cat Financials financial results are largely dependent upon the ability of Caterpillar dealers to sell equipment and customers willingness to enter into financing or leasing agreements. It is also affected by, among other things, the availability of funds from its financing sources, general economic conditions such as inflation and market interest rates and its cost of funds relative to its competitors.  Cat Financial has a match funding policy that addresses interest rate risk by aligning the interest rate profile (fixed rate or floating rate) of its debt portfolio with the interest rate profile of its receivables portfolio (loans and leases with customers and dealers) within predetermined ranges on an ongoing basis. In connection with that policy, Cat Financial issues debt with a similar interest rate profile to its receivables, and also uses interest rate swap agreements to manage its interest rate risk exposure to interest rate changes and in some cases to lower its cost of borrowed funds. For more information regarding match funding, please see Note 3  Derivative financial instruments and risk management of Exhibit 13. See also the risk factor titled Our Financial Products line of business is subject to risks associated with the financial service industry for general risks associated with our financial products business included in Item 1A. of this Form 10-K.   In managing foreign currency risk for Cat Financials operations, the objective is to minimize earnings volatility resulting from conversion and the remeasurement of net foreign currency balance sheet positions. This policy allows the use of foreign currency forward and option contracts to address the risk of currency mismatch between the receivable and debt portfolios. None of these foreign currency forward and option contracts are designated as a hedge.  Cat Financial provides financing only when certain criteria are met. Credit decisions are based on, among other factors, the customers credit history, financial strength and equipment application. Cat Financial typically maintains a security interest in retail-financed equipment and requires physical damage insurance coverage on financed equipment. Cat Financial finances a significant portion of Caterpillar dealers sales and inventory of Caterpillar equipment throughout the world. Cat Financials competitive position is improved by marketing programs offered in conjunction with Caterpillar and/or Caterpillar dealers. Under these programs, Caterpillar, or the dealer, subsidizes an amount at the outset of the transaction, which Cat Financial then recognizes as revenue over the term of the financing. We believe that these marketing programs provide Cat Financial a significant competitive advantage in financing Caterpillar products.

Business Combinations  Information related to business combinations appears in Note 23  Business combinations of Exhibit 13.  Competitive Environment  Caterpillar products and product support services are sold worldwide into a variety of highly competitive markets. In all markets, we compete on the basis of product performance, customer service, quality and price. From time to time, the intensity of competition results in price discounting in a particular industry or region. Such price discounting puts pressure on margins and can negatively impact operating profit. Outside the United States, certain of our competitors enjoy competitive advantages inherent to operating in their home countries or regions.  Raw Materials and Component Products  We source our raw materials and manufactured components from suppliers both domestically and internationally. These purchases include unformed materials and rough and finished parts. Unformed materials include a variety of steel products, which are then cut or formed to shape and machined in our facilities. Rough parts include various sized steel and iron castings and forgings, which are machined to final specification levels inside our facilities. Finished parts are ready to assemble components, which are made either to Caterpillar specifications or to the supplier developed specifications. We machine and assemble some of the components used in our machines, engines and power generation units and to support our after-market dealer parts sales. We also purchase various goods and services used in production, logistics, offices and product development processes. We maintain global strategic sourcing models to meet our global facilities production needs while building long-term supplier relationships and leveraging enterprise spend. We expect our suppliers to maintain, at all times, industry-leading levels of quality and the ability to timely deliver raw materials and component products for our machine and engine products. We use a variety of agreements with suppliers to protect our intellectual property and processes to monitor and mitigate risks of the supply base causing a business disruption. The risks monitored include supplier financial viability, the ability to increase or decrease production levels, business continuity, quality and delivery.  Order Backlog  The dollar amount of backlog believed to be firm was approximately $29.8 billion, $18.7 billion and $9.6 billion at December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. Of the total backlog, approximately $4.0 billion, $2.8 billion and $2.5 billion at December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively, was not expected to be filled in the following year. In 2011, order backlog increased by approximately $4.1 billion due to the acquisition of Bucyrus. The remaining increase for 2011 compared to 2010 and 2009 year end is primarily due to an increase in volume across most business units.  Dealers and Distributors  Our machines are distributed principally through a worldwide organization of dealers (dealer network), 50 located in the United States and 141 located outside the United States, serving 182 countries and operating 3,504 places of business, including dealer rental outlets. Reciprocating engines are sold principally through the dealer network and to other manufacturers for use in their products. Some of the reciprocating engines manufactured by Perkins Engines   Company Limited (Perkins) are also sold through its worldwide network of 118 distributors located in 183 countries. Most of the electric power generation systems manufactured by F.G. Wilson Engineering Limited (FG Wilson) are sold through its worldwide network of 168 distributors located in 179 countries. Some of the large, medium speed reciprocating engines are also sold under the MaK brand through a worldwide network of 19 distributors located in 130 countries.  Our dealers do not deal exclusively with our products; however, in most cases sales and servicing of our products are the dealers principal business. Turbines, locomotives and certain global mining products are sold through sales forces employed by the company. At times, these employees are assisted by independent sales representatives.  For Caterpillar branded products, the companys relationship with each of its independent dealers is memorialized in a standard sales and service agreement. Pursuant to this agreement, the company grants the dealer the right to purchase and sell its products and to service the products in a specified geographic service territory. Prices to dealers are established by the company after receiving input from dealers on transactional pricing in the marketplace. The company also agrees to defend its intellectual property and to provide warranty and technical support to the dealer. The agreement further grants the dealer a non-exclusive license to use the companys trademarks, service marks and brand names. In some instances, a separate trademark agreement exists between the company and a dealer.  In exchange for these rights, the agreement obligates the dealer to develop and promote the sale of the companys products to current and prospective customers in the dealers service territory. Each dealer agrees to employ adequate sales and support personnel to market, sell and promote the companys products, demonstrate and exhibit the products, perform the companys product improvement programs, inform the company concerning any features that might affect the safe operation of any of the companys products and maintain detailed books and records of the dealers financial condition, sales and inventories and make these books and records available at the companys reasonable request.  These sales and service agreements are terminable at will by either party upon 90 days written notice and provide for termination automatically if the dealer files for bankruptcy protection or upon the occurrence of comparable action seeking protection from creditors.  Patents and Trademarks  Our products are sold primarily under the brands Caterpillar, CAT, design versions of CAT and Caterpillar, Electro-Motive, FG Wilson, MaK, MWM, Olympian, Perkins, Progress Rail, SEM and Solar Turbines. We own a number of patents and trademarks, which have been obtained over a period of years and relate to the products we manufacture and the services we provide. These patents and trademarks have been of value in the growth of our business and may continue to be of value in the future. We do not regard any of our business as being dependent upon any single patent or group of patents.  Research and Development  We have always placed strong emphasis on product-oriented research and development relating to the development of new or improved machines, engines and major components. In 2011, 2010 and 2009, we spent $2,297 million, $1,905 million and $1,421 million, or 3.8 percent, 4.4 percent, and 4.4 percent of our sales and revenues, respectively, on our research and development programs. Research and development expense is expected to increase about 15 percent in 2012, primarily related to the introduction of products designed to meet applicable emissions requirements.  Employment  As of December 31, 2011, we employed 125,099 persons of whom 71,863 were located outside the United States. We build and maintain a productive, motivated workforce by striving to treat all employees fairly and equitably.  In the United States, most of our 53,236 employees are at-will employees and, therefore, not subject to any type of employment contract or agreement. At select business units, certain highly specialized employees have been hired under employment contracts that specify a term of employment and specify pay and other benefits.   As of December 31, 2011, there were 14,367 U.S. hourly production employees who were covered by collective bargaining agreements with various labor unions. The United Automobile, Aerospace and Agricultural Implement Workers of America (UAW) represents 9,684 Caterpillar employees under a six-year central labor agreement that expires on March 1, 2017. The International Association of Machinists (IAM) represents 2,000 employees under labor agreements that will expire on April 30, 2012 and May 17, 2015.  Outside the United States, the company enters into employment contracts and agreements in those countries in which such relationships are mandatory or customary. The provisions of these agreements correspond in each case with the required or customary terms in the subject jurisdiction.  Sales  Sales outside the United States were 70 percent of consolidated sales for 2011, 68 percent for 2010 and 69 percent for 2009.  Environmental Matters  The company is regulated by federal, state and international environmental laws governing our use, transport and disposal of substances and control of emissions. In addition to governing our manufacturing and other operations, these laws often impact the development of our products, including, but not limited to, required compliance with air emissions standards applicable to internal combustion engines. Compliance with these existing laws has not had a material impact on our capital expenditures, earnings or global competitive position.  We are engaged in remedial activities at a number of locations, often with other companies, pursuant to federal and state laws. When it is reasonably probable we will pay remedial costs at a site, and those costs can be reasonably estimated, the costs are accrued against our earnings. In formulating that estimate, we do not consider amounts expected to be recovered from insurance companies or others. The amount recorded for environmental remediation is not material and is included in the line item Accrued expenses in Statement 2  Consolidated Financial Position at December 31 of Exhibit 13.  We cannot reasonably estimate costs at sites in the very early stages of remediation. Currently, we have a few sites in the very early stages of remediation, and there is no more than a remote chance that a material amount for remedial activities at any individual site, or at all sites in the aggregate, will be required.

Risk Factors.  The statements in this section describe the most significant risks to our business and should be considered carefully in conjunction with Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements of Exhibit 13 to this Form 10-K. In addition, the statements in this section and other sections of this Form 10-K include forward-looking statements as that term is defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and involve uncertainties that could significantly impact results. Forward-looking statements give current expectations or forecasts of future events about the company or our outlook. You can identify forward-looking statements by the fact they do not relate to historical or current facts and by the use of words such as believe, expect, estimate, anticipate, will be, should, plan, project, intend, could and similar words or expressions.  Forward-looking statements may include statements relating to future actions, prospective products, product approvals, future performance or results of current and anticipated products, sales efforts, expenses, interest rates, foreign exchange rates, the outcome of contingencies, economic conditions, potential returns, financial condition and financial results. Such statements are based on assumptions and on known risks and uncertainties. Although we believe we have been prudent in our assumptions, any or all of our forward-looking statements may prove to be inaccurate, and we can make no guarantees about our future performance. Should known or unknown risks or uncertainties materialize or underlying assumptions prove inaccurate, actual results could materially differ from past results and/or those anticipated, estimated or projected.   The company undertakes no obligation to publicly update forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. You should, however, consult any subsequent disclosures we make in our filings with the SEC on Form 10-Q or Form 8-K.  The following is a cautionary discussion of risks, uncertainties and assumptions that we believe are significant to our business. In addition to the factors discussed elsewhere in this report, the following are some of the important factors that, individually or in the aggregate, we believe could make our actual results differ materially from those described in any forward-looking statements. It is impossible to predict or identify all such factors and, as a result, you should not consider the following factors to be a complete discussion of risks, uncertainties and assumptions.  Our business is highly sensitive to global economic conditions and economic conditions in the industries and markets we serve.  Our results of operations are materially affected by conditions in the global economy generally and in various capital markets. The demand for our products and services tends to be cyclical and can be significantly reduced in an economic environment characterized by higher unemployment, lower consumer spending, lower corporate earnings and lower levels of government and business investment. A prolonged period of slow growth may also reduce demand for our products and services. Economic conditions vary across regions and countries, and demand for our products generally increases in those regions and countries experiencing economic growth and investment. A change in the global mix of regions and countries experiencing economic growth and investment could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.  The energy and mining industries are major users of our products, including the coal, iron ore, gold, copper, oil and natural gas industries. Decisions to purchase our products are dependent upon the performance of the industries in which our customers operate. If demand or output in these industries increases, the demand for our products will generally increase. Likewise, if demand or output in these industries declines, the demand for our products will generally decrease. Prices of commodities in these industries are frequently volatile and change in response to general economic conditions, economic growth, government actions, regulatory actions, commodity inventories and any disruptions in production or distribution. We assume certain prices for key commodities in preparing our general economic and financial outlooks (outlooks). Commodity prices lower than those assumed in our outlooks may negatively impact our business, results of operations and financial condition.  The rates of infrastructure spending, housing starts and commercial construction also play a significant role in our results. Our products are an integral component of these activities, and as these activities increase or decrease inside or outside of the United States, demand for our products may be significantly impacted, which could negatively impact our results. Slower rates of economic growth than anticipated in our outlooks could also adversely impact our business, results of operations and financial condition.  Changes in government monetary or fiscal policies may negatively impact our results .  Most countries have established central banks to regulate monetary systems and influence economic activities, generally by adjusting interest rates. Interest rate changes affect overall economic growth, which affects demand for residential and nonresidential structures, energy and mined products, which in turn affects sales of our products that serve these activities. Interest rate changes also affect our customers ability to finance machine purchases, can change the optimal time to keep machines in a fleet and can impact the ability of our suppliers to finance the production of parts and components necessary to manufacture and support our products. Our outlooks typically include assumptions about interest rates in a number of countries. Interest rates higher than those contained in our assumptions could result in lower sales than anticipated and supply chain inefficiencies.  Central banks and other policy arms of many countries take actions to vary the amount of liquidity and credit available in an economy. Liquidity and credit policies different from those assumed in our outlooks could impact the customers and markets we serve or our suppliers, which could adversely impact our business, results of operations and financial condition.   Government policies on taxes and spending also affect our business. Throughout the world, government spending finances a significant portion of infrastructure development, such as highways, airports, sewer and water systems and dams. Tax regulations determine depreciation lives and the amount of money users of our products can retain, both of which influence investment decisions. Unfavorable developments, such as declines in government revenues, decisions to reduce public spending or increases in taxes, could negatively impact our results.  Commodity or component price increases and significant shortages of component products may adversely impact our financial results or our ability to meet commitments to customers.  We are a significant user of steel and many other commodities required for the manufacture of our products. As a result, unanticipated increases in the prices of such commodities would increase our costs more than expected, negatively impacting our business, results of operations and financial condition if we are unable to fully offset the effect of these increased costs through price increases, productivity improvements or cost reduction programs.  We rely on suppliers to secure component products, particularly steel, required for the manufacture of our products. During the 2008-2009 global economic downturn, we reduced our own production levels and, as a result, our suppliers experienced significant decreases in demand for their products. Since 2010, we have significantly increased production levels and have announced a number of capacity expansion programs. We cannot guarantee that key suppliers will increase production in time to meet growing demand for our products. A disruption in deliveries to or from suppliers or decreased availability of components or commodities could have an adverse effect on our ability to meet our commitments to customers or increase our operating costs. Our business, competitive position, results of operations or financial condition could be negatively impacted if supply is insufficient for our operations.  Disruptions or volatility in global financial markets could limit our sources of liquidity, or the liquidity of our customers, dealers and suppliers.  Global economic conditions may cause volatility and disruptions in the capital and credit markets. During the 2008-2009 global economic downturn, financial markets decreased the availability of liquidity, credit and credit capacity for certain issuers, including certain of our customers, dealers and suppliers. Although we generally generate funds from our operations to pay our operating expenses, fund our capital expenditures, fund our employee retirement benefit programs, pay dividends and buy back stock, continuing to meet these cash requirements over the long-term requires substantial liquidity and access to sources of funds, including capital and credit markets. Changes in global economic conditions, including material cost increases and decreases in economic activity in the markets that we serve, and the success of plans to manage cost increases, inventory and other important elements of our business may significantly impact our ability to generate funds from operations. Market volatility, changes in counterparty credit risk, the impact of government intervention in financial markets and general economic conditions may also adversely impact our ability to access capital and credit markets to fund operating needs. An inability to access capital and credit markets may have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and competitive position.  In addition, the global demand for our products generally depends on customers ability to pay for our products, which, in turn, depends on their access to funds. Subject to global economic conditions, customers may experience increased difficulty in generating funds from operations. Further, following capital and credit market volatility and uncertainty, many financial institutions have revised their lending standards, thereby decreasing access to capital. If capital and credit market volatility occurs, customers liquidity may decline which, in turn, would reduce their ability to purchase our products.   Our global operations are exposed to political and economic risks, commercial instability and events beyond our control in the countries in which we operate.  Our global operations are dependent upon products manufactured, purchased and sold in the U.S. and internationally, including in countries with political and economic instability. In some cases, these countries have greater political and economic volatility and greater vulnerability to infrastructure and labor disruptions than in our other markets. Operating and seeking to expand business in a number of different regions and countries exposes us to a number of risks, including:    multiple and potentially conflicting laws, regulations and policies that are subject to change;    imposition of currency restrictions, restrictions on repatriation of earnings or other restraints;    imposition of burdensome tariffs or quotas;    national and international conflict, including terrorist acts; and    political and economic instability or civil unrest that may severely disrupt economic activity in affected countries.  The occurrence of one or more of these events may negatively impact our business, results of operations and financial condition.  Failure to maintain our credit ratings would increase our cost of borrowing and could adversely affect our access to capital markets.  Caterpillars and Cat Financials costs of borrowing and ability to access the capital markets are affected not only by market conditions but also by the short- and long-term debt ratings assigned to their debt by the major credit rating agencies. These ratings are based, in significant part, on Caterpillars and Cat Financials performance as measured by financial metrics such as net worth and interest coverage and leverage ratios, as well as transparency with rating agencies and timeliness of financial reporting. In 2009, each of the major credit rating agencies either modified their outlook for the company and Cat Financial or downgraded the rating. While the rating agencies subsequently improved their outlooks to stable, there can be no assurance that Caterpillars or Cat Financials credit ratings will not be lowered in the future.  Although the company and Cat Financial have committed credit facilities to provide liquidity, any downgrades of our credit ratings may increase our cost of borrowing and could have an adverse effect on our access to the capital markets, including restricting, in whole or in part, our access to the commercial paper market. There can be no assurance that the commercial paper market will continue to be a reliable source of short-term financing for the company. An inability to access the capital markets could have an adverse effect on our cash flow, results of operations and financial condition.  Our Financial Products line of business is subject to risks associated with the financial services industry.  Difficult and volatile market conditions may have an adverse effect upon the financial industry in which Cat Financial operates. Cat Financial is significant to our operations and provides financing support to a significant share of our global sales. The inability of Cat Financial to access funds to support its financing activities to our customers could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.   Inherent in the operation of Cat Financial is the credit risk associated with its customers. The creditworthiness of each customer and the rate of delinquencies, repossessions and net losses on customer obligations are directly impacted by several factors, including relevant industry and economic conditions, the availability of capital, the experience and expertise of the customers management team, commodity prices, political events and the sustained value of the underlying collateral.  Changes in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and market liquidity conditions could have an adverse effect on Cat Financials and our earnings and cash flows. Because a significant number of the loans made by Cat Financial are made at fixed interest rates, its business is subject to fluctuations in interest rates. Changes in market interest rates may influence its financing costs, returns on financial investments and the valuation of derivative contracts and could reduce its and our earnings and cash flows. In addition, because Cat Financial makes a significant number of loans in currencies other than the U.S. dollar, fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could also reduce its and our earnings and cash flows. Although Cat Financial manages interest rate, foreign currency exchange rate and market liquidity risks through a variety of techniques, including a match funding program, the selective use of derivatives and a broadly diversified funding program, there can be no assurance that fluctuations in interest rates, currency exchange rates and market liquidity conditions will not have an adverse effect on its and our earnings and cash flows. If any of the variety of instruments and strategies Cat Financial uses to hedge its exposure to these various types of risk is ineffective, we may incur losses. With respect to Cat Insurances investment activities, changes in the equity and bond markets could cause an impairment of the value of its investment portfolio, requiring a negative adjustment to earnings.  The U.S. Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Dodd-Frank) was signed into law in July 2010 and includes extensive provisions regulating the financial services industry. We continue to monitor and evaluate the impact of this legislation as regulators propose, adopt and enforce the implementing rules. We are also monitoring other U.S. and international initiatives to further regulate the financial services industry. If the Dodd-Frank rules, as implemented, or other laws or regulations impose significant costs or restrictions on the company or Cat Financial, we could experience an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.  Cat Financial relies on a number of diversified global debt markets and funding programs to provide liquidity for its global operations, including commercial paper, medium term notes, retail notes, variable denomination floating rate demand notes, asset-backed securitizations and bank loans. Significant changes in market liquidity conditions could impact Cat Financials access to funding, increase the associated funding costs and reduce its and our earnings and cash flows. A large portion of Cat Financials borrowings have been issued in the medium term note and commercial paper markets. While Cat Financial has maintained access to key global medium term note and commercial paper markets, there can be no assurance that such markets will continue to represent a reliable source of financing for Cat Financial. Should global economic conditions deteriorate or access to debt markets be reduced, Cat Financial could experience materially higher financing costs and become unable to access adequate funding to operate and grow its business and/or meet its debt service obligations as they mature, or it could be required to draw upon contractually committed lending agreements primarily provided by global banks and/or by seeking other funding sources. However, under extreme market conditions, there can be no assurance such agreements and other funding sources would be available or sufficient. Any of these events could negatively impact Cat Financials business, results of operations and financial condition. The extent of any impact on our ability to meet funding or liquidity needs would depend on several factors, including our operating cash flows, the duration of any future market disruptions, the effects of governmental intervention in the financial markets including the effects of any programs or legislation designed to increase or restrict liquidity for certain areas of the market, general credit conditions, the volatility of equity and debt markets, our credit ratings and credit capacity and the cost of financing and other general economic and business conditions.  Market disruption and volatility may also lead to a number of other risks, including:    Market developments that may affect customer confidence levels and cause declines in the demand for financing and adverse changes in payment patterns, causing increases in delinquencies and default rates, which could impact Cat Financials write-offs and provision for credit losses.    The process Cat Financial uses to estimate losses inherent in its credit exposure requires a high degree of   managements judgment regarding numerous subjective qualitative factors, including forecasts of economic conditions and how economic predictors might impair the ability of its borrowers to repay their loans. Financial market disruption and volatility may impact the accuracy of these judgments.    Cat Financials ability to engage in routine funding transactions or borrow from other financial institutions on acceptable terms or at all could be adversely affected by disruptions in the capital markets or other events, including actions by rating agencies and deteriorating investor expectations.    As Cat Financials counterparties are primarily financial institutions, their ability to perform in accordance with any of its underlying agreements could be adversely affected by market volatility and/or disruptions in financial markets.  We engage in acquisitions and divestitures, including the acquisition of Bucyrus; we may not realize all of the anticipated benefits of these transactions or these benefits may take longer to realize than expected.  From time to time we engage in strategic transactions involving risks, including the possible failure to successfully integrate acquired businesses or realize the expected benefits of such transactions. On July 8, 2011, we acquired Bucyrus, and subsequently announced our intention to sell the Bucyrus distribution business to Caterpillar dealers who support mining customers. We are working to integrate the mining businesses of both companies, to transition the Bucyrus distribution business to our dealers and to realize the benefits of this acquisition. We may not receive sufficient proceeds from the sale of the Bucyrus distribution business to offset the sales and service revenues we will forego as a result of this transfer. Even if the mining businesses are successfully integrated and the Bucyrus distribution business is successfully transferred to our dealers, we may not realize the full benefits of the transaction, including the synergies, cost savings or sales or growth opportunities that we expect. These benefits may not be achieved within the anticipated time frame, or at all. In addition, the integration may result in material unanticipated problems, expenses, liabilities or competitive responses. The risks associated with this acquisition and our other past or future acquisitions include:    The business culture of the acquired business may not match well with our culture;    Technological and product synergies, economies of scale and cost reductions may not occur as expected;    Unforeseen expenses, delays or conditions may be imposed upon the acquisition, including due to required regulatory approvals or consents;    The company may acquire or assume unexpected liabilities or be subject to unexpected penalties or other enforcement actions;    Faulty assumptions may be made regarding the integration process;    Unforeseen difficulties may arise in integrating operations, processes and systems;    Higher than expected investments may be required to implement necessary compliance processes and related systems, including IT systems, accounting systems and internal controls over financial reporting;    The company may fail to retain, motivate and integrate key management and other employees of the acquired business;    Higher than expected finance costs may arise due to unforeseen changes in tax, trade, environmental, labor, safety, payroll or pension policies in any jurisdiction in which the acquired business conducts its operations; and    The company may experience problems in retaining customers and integrating customer bases.   Many of these factors will be outside of the companys control and any one of them could result in increased costs, decreases in the amount of expected revenues and diversion of managements time and attention.  In addition, in order to conserve cash for operations, we may undertake acquisitions financed in part through public offerings or private placements of debt or equity securities, or other arrangements. Such acquisition financing could result in a decrease of our ratio of earnings to fixed charges and adversely affect other leverage measures. If we issue equity securities or equity-linked securities, the issued securities may have a dilutive effect on the interests of the holders of our common shares.  Failure to implement the companys acquisition strategy, including successfully integrating acquired businesses, could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Furthermore, we make strategic divestitures from time to time. These divestitures may result in continued financial involvement in the divested businesses, including through guarantees or other financial arrangements, following the transaction. Lower performance by those divested businesses could affect our future financial results.  International trade policies may impact demand for our products and our competitive position.  Government policies on international trade and investment such as import quotas, capital controls or tariffs, whether adopted by individual governments or addressed by regional trade blocs, can affect the demand for our products and services, impact the competitive position of our products or prevent us from being able to sell products in certain countries. The implementation of more restrictive trade policies, such as more detailed inspections, higher tariffs or new barriers to entry, in countries in which we sell large quantities of products and services could negatively impact our business, results of operations and financial condition. For example, a governments adoption of buy national policies or retaliation by another government against such policies could have a negative impact on our results of operations.  Our introduction of Tier 4 emissions compliant machines and engines may not be successful.  Regulatory agencies have adopted new and more stringent emission standards, including EPA Tier 4 Interim and Tier 4 Final nonroad diesel emission requirements and equivalent standards in the EU, Japan and Canada (Tier 4). The first phase of these standards, Tier 4 Interim, applied to the majority of our nonroad machinery and engine products commencing in 2011. We are using certain technology with state of the art integrated systems, as well as the transitional provisions provided by the regulations in order to comply with the Tier 4 emissions requirements.  Our plans to meet Tier 4 emissions requirements are subject to many variables, including the timing of our Tier 4 engine development and new machine product introduction. If we are unable to meet our plans as projected, it could delay or inhibit our ability to continue placing certain products on the market, which could negatively impact our financial results and competitive position. We are incurring research and development costs to design and introduce products to meet Tier 4 requirements. We are including costs associated with Tier 4 development and production in prices of our products. The level of market acceptance of prices for products that meet Tier 4 requirements could negatively impact our financial results and competitive position.  The success of our business depends on our ability to develop, produce and market quality products that meet our customers needs.  Our business relies on continued global demand for our brands and products. To achieve business goals, we must develop and sell products that appeal to our dealers, OEMs and customers. This is dependent on a number of factors, including our ability to manage and maintain key dealer relationships, our ability to produce products that meet the quality, performance and price expectations of our customers and our ability to develop effective sales, advertising and marketing programs. In addition, our continued success in selling products that appeal to our customers is dependent on leading-edge innovation, with respect to both products and operations, and on the availability and effectiveness of legal protection for our innovation. Failure to continue to deliver quality and competitive products to the marketplace, to adequately protect our intellectual property rights, to supply products that meet applicable regulatory requirements or to predict market demands for, or gain market acceptance of, our products, could have a negative impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition.   We operate in a highly competitive environment, which could adversely affect our sales and pricing.  We operate in a highly competitive environment, and our outlook depends on a forecast of the companys share of industry sales based on our ability to compete with others in the marketplace. The company competes on the basis of product performance, customer service, quality and price. There can be no assurance that our products will be able to compete successfully with other companies products. Thus, our share of industry sales could be reduced due to aggressive pricing or product strategies pursued by competitors, unanticipated product or manufacturing difficulties, our failure to price our products competitively, our failure to produce our products at a competitive cost or an unexpected buildup in competitors new machine or dealer-owned rental fleets, leading to severe downward pressure on machine rental rates and/or used equipment prices.  Our sales outlook assumes that certain price increases we announce from time to time will hold in the marketplace. Changes in market acceptance of price increases, changes in market requirements for price discounts or changes in our competitors behavior could have an adverse impact on the companys business, results of operations and financial condition.  In addition, our results and ability to compete may be impacted negatively by changes in our sales mix. Our outlook assumes a certain geographic mix of sales as well as a product mix of sales. If actual results vary from this projected geographic and product mix of sales, our results could be negatively impacted.  We may not realize all of the anticipated benefits from capacity expansion projects, cost-reduction initiatives, cash flow improvement initiatives and efficiency or productivity initiatives, including the Caterpillar Production System (CPS).  We have announced a number of capacity expansion projects to meet growing demand and to expand our share of industry sales. There can be no assurance that the benefits expected from these projects will be realized as anticipated or at all. Certain of our competitors have also announced investments to increase capacity. Industry overcapacity could contribute to a weak pricing environment, which could have an adverse impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition.  We are also actively engaged in a number of initiatives to increase our productivity, efficiency and cash flow and to reduce costs, which have had a positive effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. CPS is a productivity initiative that aims to improve our order-to-delivery processes and factory efficiency, as well as to reduce waste and maximize value for our customers. We are also in the process of implementing a new operating and financial reporting system in many of our businesses to increase efficiency and harmonize our operations and reporting. There can be no assurance that these systems and initiatives or others will continue to be beneficial to the extent anticipated, or that the estimated efficiency improvements, incremental cost savings or cash flow improvements will be realized as anticipated or at all. If our new operating and reporting system is not implemented successfully, it could have an adverse effect on our operations and results of operations, including our ability to report accurate and timely financial results.  Our business is subject to the sourcing practices of our dealers and our OEM customers.  We sell finished products through an independent dealer network and directly to OEMs. Both carry inventories of finished products as part of ongoing operations and adjust those inventories based on their assessments of future needs. Such adjustments can impact our results either positively or negatively. In particular, some of our engine customers are OEMs that manufacture or could in the future manufacture engines for their own products. Despite their engine manufacturing abilities, these customers have chosen to outsource certain types of engine production to us due to the quality of our engine products and in order to reduce costs, eliminate production risks and maintain company focus. However, we cannot assure that these customers will continue to outsource engine manufacture in the future. Decreased levels of production outsourcing by these customers could result from a number of factors, such as shifts in our customers business strategies, acquisition by a customer of another engine manufacturer, the inability of third-party suppliers to meet specifications and the emergence of low-cost production opportunities in foreign countries. A significant reduction in the level of engine production outsourcing from our OEM customers could significantly impact our revenues and, accordingly, have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.   We are subject to stringent environmental laws and regulations that impose significant compliance costs.  Our facilities, operations and products are subject to increasingly stringent environmental laws and regulations, including laws and regulations governing emissions to air, discharges to water and the generation, handling, storage, transportation, treatment and disposal of non-hazardous and hazardous waste materials. While we believe we are in compliance in all material respects with these environmental laws and regulations, we cannot provide assurances that we will not be adversely affected by costs, liabilities or claims with respect to existing or subsequently acquired operations or under present laws and regulations or those that may be adopted or imposed in the future.  In particular, our engines are subject to extensive statutory and regulatory requirements governing exhaust emissions and noise, including standards imposed by the EPA, state regulatory agencies in the United States and other regulatory agencies around the world. For instance, national, state or local governments may set new emissions standards that could impact our products and operations in ways that are difficult to anticipate with accuracy. Thus, significant changes in standards, or the adoption of new standards, have the potential to negatively impact our business, results of operations, financial condition and competitive position.  Our global operations are subject to extensive trade and anti-corruption laws and regulations.  Due to the international scope of our operations, we are subject to a complex system of import- and export-related laws and regulations, including U.S. regulations issued by Customs and Border Protection, the Bureau of Industry and Security, the Office of Antiboycott Compliance, the Directorate of Defense Trade Controls and the Office of Foreign Assets Control, as well as the counterparts of these agencies in other countries. Any alleged or actual violations may subject us to government scrutiny, investigation and civil and criminal penalties, and may limit our ability to import or export our products or to provide services outside the United States. We cannot predict the nature, scope or effect of future regulatory requirements to which our operations might be subject or the manner in which existing laws might be administered or interpreted.  In addition, the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and similar foreign anti-corruption laws generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments or providing anything of value to improperly influence foreign government officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business, or obtaining an unfair advantage. Recent years have seen a substantial increase in the global enforcement of anti-corruption laws. Our continued operation and expansion outside the United States, including in developing countries, could increase the risk of such violations. Violations of these laws may result in severe criminal or civil sanctions, could disrupt our business, and result in an adverse effect on our reputation, business and results of operations or financial condition.  Moreover, several of our joint venture partners are domiciled in areas of the world with laws, rules and business practices that differ from those in the United States. Although we strive to select joint venture partners who share our values and understand our reporting requirements as a U.S.-domiciled company and to ensure that an appropriate business culture exists within these ventures to minimize and mitigate our risk, we nonetheless face the reputational and legal risk that our joint venture partners will violate applicable laws, rules and business practices.  We may incur additional tax expense or become subject to additional tax exposure.  We are subject to income taxes in the United States and numerous foreign jurisdictions, and our domestic and international tax liabilities are dependent upon the distribution of income among these different jurisdictions. Our provision for income taxes and cash tax liability in the future could be adversely affected by numerous factors, including income before taxes being lower than anticipated in countries with lower statutory tax rates and higher than anticipated in countries with higher statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities and changes in tax laws and regulations. We are also subject to the continuous examination of our income tax returns by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities. The results of audits and examinations of previously filed tax returns and continuing assessments of our tax exposures may have an adverse effect on the companys provision for income taxes and cash tax liability.   Currency exchange rate fluctuations affect our results of operations, as reported in our financial statements.  We conduct operations in many areas of the world, involving transactions denominated in a variety of currencies. We are subject to currency exchange rate risk to the extent that our costs are denominated in currencies other than those in which we earn revenues. In addition, because our financial statements are reported in U.S. dollars, changes in currency exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and other currencies have had, and will continue to have, an impact on our results of operations. While we customarily enter into financial transactions to address these risks, there can be no assurance that currency exchange rate fluctuations will not adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. In addition, while the use of currency hedging instruments may provide us with protection from adverse fluctuations in currency exchange rates, by utilizing these instruments we potentially forego the benefits that might result from favorable fluctuations in currency exchange rates.  We also face risks arising from the imposition of exchange controls and currency devaluations. Exchange controls may limit our ability to convert foreign currencies into U.S. dollars or to remit dividends and other payments by our foreign subsidiaries or businesses located in or conducted within a country imposing controls. Currency devaluations result in a diminished value of funds denominated in the currency of the country instituting the devaluation.  Restrictive covenants in our debt agreements could limit our financial and operating flexibility.  We maintain a number of credit facilities to support (i) our commercial paper program and (ii) general corporate purposes (facilities) and have issued debt securities to manage liquidity and fund operations (debt securities). The agreements relating to a number of the facilities and the debt securities contain certain restrictive covenants applicable to us and certain of our subsidiaries, including Cat Financial. These covenants include maintaining a consolidated net worth (defined as the consolidated stockholders equity including preferred stock but excluding the pension and other post-retirement benefits balance within accumulated other comprehensive income (loss)) of not less than $9 billion, limitations on the incurrence of liens and certain restrictions on consolidation and merger. Cat Financial has also agreed under certain of these agreements to maintain a leverage ratio (consolidated debt to consolidated net worth, calculated (1) on a monthly basis as the average of the leverage ratios determined on the last day of each of the six preceding calendar months and (2) at each December 31) not greater than 10.0 to 1, to maintain a minimum interest coverage ratio (profit excluding income taxes, interest expense and net gain/(loss) from interest rate derivatives to interest expense, calculated at the end of each calendar quarter for the rolling four quarter period then most recently ended) of not less than 1.15 to 1 and not to terminate, amend or modify its support agreement with us.  Although we do not believe any of these covenants presently materially restrict our operations, a breach of one or more of the covenants could result in adverse consequences that could negatively impact our business, results of operations and financial condition. These consequences may include the acceleration of amounts outstanding under certain of the facilities, triggering of an obligation to redeem certain debt securities, termination of existing unused commitments by our lenders, refusal by our lenders to extend further credit under one or more of the facilities or to enter into new facilities or the lowering or modification of our credit ratings or those of one or more of our subsidiaries.  Sustained increases in funding obligations under our pension plans may reduce our profitability.  We maintain certain defined benefit pension plans for our employees, which impose on us certain funding obligations. In determining our future payment obligations under the plans, we assume certain rates of return on the plan assets and growth rates of certain costs. Significant adverse changes in credit or capital markets could result in actual rates of return being materially lower than projected and increased pension expense in future years. We may be required to make contributions to our pension plans in the future, and these contributions could be material. Our cost growth rates may also be materially higher than projected. These factors could significantly increase our payment obligations under the plans, require us to take a significant charge on our balance sheet and, as a result, adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.  Union disputes or other employee relations issues could adversely affect our operations and financial results .  Some of our employees are represented by labor unions in a number of countries under various collective bargaining agreements with varying durations and expiration dates. There can be no assurance that any current or future issues   with our employees will be resolved or that we will not encounter future strikes, work stoppages or other types of conflicts with labor unions or our employees. We may not be able to satisfactorily renegotiate collective bargaining agreements in the United States and other countries when they expire. If we fail to renegotiate our existing collective bargaining agreements, we could encounter strikes or work stoppages or other types of conflicts with labor unions. In addition, existing collective bargaining agreements may not prevent a strike or work stoppage at our facilities in the future. We may also be subject to general country strikes or work stoppages unrelated to our business or collective bargaining agreements. Any such work stoppages (or potential work stoppages) could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.  Costs associated with lawsuits or investigations or increases in the reserves we establish based on our assessment of contingencies may have an adverse effect on our results of operations.  We face an inherent business risk of exposure to various types of claims and lawsuits. We are involved in various intellectual property, product liability, product warranty and environmental claims and lawsuits and other legal proceedings that arise in and outside of the ordinary course of our business. The industries in which we operate are also periodically reviewed or investigated by regulators, which could lead to enforcement actions, fines and penalties or the assertion of private litigation claims. It is not possible to predict with certainty the outcome of claims, investigations and lawsuits, and we could in the future incur judgments, fines or penalties or enter into settlements of lawsuits and claims that could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition in any particular period. In addition, while we maintain insurance coverage with respect to certain claims, we may not be able to obtain such insurance on acceptable terms in the future, if at all, and any such insurance may not provide adequate coverage against any such claims.  As required by U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), we establish reserves based on our assessment of contingencies, including contingencies related to legal claims asserted against us. Subsequent developments in legal proceedings may affect our assessment and estimates of the loss contingency recorded as a reserve and require us to make payments in excess of our reserves, which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations.  Additional carbon emissions constraints may impact our capital expenditures, results of operations and competitive position.  The potential for government-mandated reductions of carbon emissions from our facilities and products is increasing. Mandatory legislative, regulatory and/or policy-based constraints are being implemented or considered by many jurisdictions. For example, the EPA has promulgated regulations governing carbon emissions from automobiles and heavy-duty on-highway diesel vehicles, which may lead to regulation of other mobile sources. Although various attempts to pass comprehensive legislation reducing carbon emissions have been unsuccessful in the United States, the EPA has also proceeded with regulating carbon emissions from stationary sources under existing law. The final details and scope of these various legislative, regulatory and policy measures around the world are unclear and their potential impact is still uncertain, so we cannot fully predict the impact on the company. However, should legislation or regulations be adopted imposing significant operational restrictions and compliance requirements upon us or our products, they could negatively impact the companys capital expenditures, results of operations and competitive position.  Changes in accounting guidance could have an adverse effect on our results of operations, as reported in our financial statements.  Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with GAAP, which is periodically revised and/or expanded. Accordingly, from time to time we are required to adopt new or revised accounting guidance and related interpretations issued by recognized authoritative bodies, including the Financial Accounting Standards Board and the SEC. Market conditions have prompted accounting guidance setters to issue new guidance that further interprets or seeks to revise accounting pronouncements related to various transactions as well as to issue new guidance expanding disclosures. The impact of accounting pronouncements that have been issued but not yet implemented is disclosed in this annual report on Form 10-K and our quarterly reports on Form 10-Q. An assessment of proposed standards is not provided, as such proposals are subject to change through the exposure process and, therefore, their effects on our financial statements cannot be meaningfully assessed. It is possible that future accounting guidance we   are required to adopt could change the current accounting treatment that we apply to our consolidated financial statements and that such changes could have an adverse effect on our results of operations, as reported in our consolidated financial statements.  Increased IT security threats and more sophisticated computer crime pose a risk to our systems, networks, products and services.  We rely upon IT systems and networks in connection with a variety of business activities, and we collect and store sensitive data. Increased IT security threats and more sophisticated computer crime, including advanced persistent threats, pose a risk to the security of our systems and networks and the confidentiality, availability and integrity of our data. A failure of or breach in security could expose the company and our customers, dealers and suppliers to risks of misuse of information or systems, the compromising of confidential information, manipulation and destruction of data, defective products, production downtimes and operations disruptions, which in turn could adversely affect our reputation, competitive position, business and results of operations. In addition, such breaches in security could result in litigation, regulatory action and potential liability and the costs and operational consequences of implementing further data protection measures.  Unexpected events, including natural disasters, may increase our cost of doing business or disrupt our operations.  The occurrence of one or more unexpected events, including fires, tornadoes, tsunamis, hurricanes, earthquakes, floods and other forms of severe weather in the United States or in other countries in which we operate or in which our suppliers are located could adversely affect our operations and financial performance. Natural disasters, pandemic illness, equipment failures, power outages or other unexpected events could result in physical damage to and complete or partial closure of one or more of our manufacturing facilities or distribution centers, temporary or long-term disruption in the supply of component products from some local and international suppliers, disruption in the transport of our products to dealers and end-users and delay in the delivery of our products to our distribution centers. Existing insurance arrangements may not provide protection for all of the costs that may arise from such events.  ", "1B": " Item 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments as of December 31, 2011.  None.

Legal Proceedings.  We have disclosed certain individual legal proceedings in this filing. Additionally, we are involved in other unresolved legal actions that arise in the normal course of business. The most prevalent of these unresolved actions involve disputes related to product design, manufacture and performance liability (including claimed asbestos and welding fumes exposure), contracts, employment issues, environmental matters or intellectual property rights. The aggregate range of reasonably possible losses in excess of accrued liabilities, if any, associated with these unresolved legal actions is not material. In some cases, we cannot reasonably estimate a range of loss because there is insufficient information regarding the matter. However, there is no more than a remote chance that any liability arising from these matters would be material. Although it is not possible to predict with certainty the outcome of these unresolved legal actions, we believe that these actions will not individually or in the aggregate have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations, financial position or liquidity.  On May 14, 2007, the EPA issued a Notice of Violation to Caterpillar Inc., alleging various violations of Clean Air Act Sections 203, 206 and 207. EPA claims that Caterpillar violated such sections by shipping engines and catalytic converter after-treatment devices separately, introducing into commerce a number of uncertified and/or misbuilt engines, and failing to timely report emissions-related defects. On July 9, 2010, the Department of Justice issued a penalty demand to Caterpillar seeking a civil penalty of $3.2 million and implementation of injunctive relief involving expanded use of certain technologies. On July 28, 2011, EPA and the U.S. Department of Justice filed and lodged a civil complaint and consent decree with the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia (Court) regarding the matter. Caterpillar has agreed to the terms of the consent decree, which require payment of a civil penalty of $2.55 million, retirement of a small number of emissions credits and expanded defect-related reporting. On September 7, 2011, the Court entered the consent decree, making it effective on that date, and Caterpillar has paid the penalty due to the United States in accordance with the decree terms. Under the terms of the consent decree, and subject to a settlement agreement, $510,000 of the stipulated $2.55 million penalty will be paid to the California Air Resources Board relating to engines covered by the consent decree that were placed into service in California.  In May 2010, an incident at Caterpillars Gosselies, Belgium facility resulted in the release of wastewater into the Perupont River. In coordination with local authorities, appropriate remediation measures have been taken. In January 2011, Caterpillar learned that the public prosecutor for the Belgian administrative district of Charleroi had referred the matter to an examining magistrate of the civil court of Charleroi for further investigation. Caterpillar cooperated fully with the Belgian authorities on this investigation. Caterpillar understands that this investigation is complete, that no proceeding was initiated, and that no further action is contemplated.  ", "4": " Item 4.

Disclosure Controls and Procedures  Under the supervision and with the participation of our chief executive officer and our chief financial officer, our management conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures, as such term is defined under Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(e). Based on this evaluation, our chief executive officer and our chief financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of the end of the period covered by this annual report.  Managements Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting  The management of Caterpillar is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as such term is defined under Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f). Our internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of our financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Our internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.  Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.  Management assessed the effectiveness of the companys internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2011. In making this assessment, we used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework . Based on our assessment we concluded that, as of December 31, 2011, the companys internal control over financial reporting was effective based on those criteria.  Management has excluded Bucyrus International, Inc. (Bucyrus) and MWM Holding GmbH (MWM) from our assessment of internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2011 because we acquired Bucyrus in July 2011 and MWM in October 2011. Bucyrus and MWM are wholly owned subsidiaries of Caterpillar Inc. whose combined total assets and total revenues represent approximately 17% and 4%, respectively, of the related consolidated financial statement amounts as of and for the year ended December 31, 2011.  The effectiveness of the companys internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2011 has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm. Their report appears on page A-4 of Exhibit 13.   Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting  During the last fiscal quarter, there has been no significant change in the companys internal control over financial reporting that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the companys internal control over financial reporting, except as noted below.  In October 2011, we acquired 100 percent of the equity in MWM. As part of the post-closing integration, we are engaged in refining and harmonizing the internal controls and processes of the acquired business with those of the company. Management has excluded the internal controls of MWM from its annual assessment of the effectiveness of the companys internal control over financial reporting (Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act) for 2011. This exclusion is in accordance with the general guidance issued by the SEC that an assessment of a recent business combination may be omitted from managements report on internal control over financial reporting in the year of consolidation.

Business. ##TABLE_END  General  Originally organized as Caterpillar Tractor Co. in 1925 in the State of California, our company was reorganized as Caterpillar Inc. in 1986 in the State of Delaware. As used herein, the term Caterpillar, we, us, our, or the company refers to Caterpillar Inc. and its subsidiaries unless designated or identified otherwise.  Overview  With 2012 sales and revenues of $65.875 billion, Caterpillar is the worlds leading manufacturer of construction and mining equipment, diesel and natural gas engines, industrial gas turbines and diesel-electric locomotives. The company is also a leading services provider through Caterpillar Financial Services Corporation (Cat Financial), Caterpillar Remanufacturing Services and Progress Rail Services Corporation (Progress Rail). Caterpillar is also a leading U.S. exporter. Through a global network of independent dealers and direct sales of certain products, Caterpillar builds long-term relationships with customers around the world.  In 2010, we announced a revised strategy and reorganization of our business into strategic business units. Currently, we have five operating segments, of which four are reportable segments and are described below. Further information about our reportable segments, including geographic information, appears in Note 22  Segment information of Exhibit 13.  Categories of Business Organization  1.   Machinery and Power Systems  Represents the aggregate total of Construction Industries, Resource Industries, Power Systems and All Other segments and related corporate items and eliminations.  2.   Financial Products  Primarily includes the companys Financial Products Segment. This category includes Cat Financial, Caterpillar Insurance Holdings Inc. (Cat Insurance) and their respective subsidiaries.  Other information about our operations in 2012, including certain risks associated with our operations, is incorporated by reference from our Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in Exhibit 13.  Construction Industries  Our Construction Industries segment is primarily responsible for supporting customers using machinery in infrastructure and building construction applications. The majority of machine sales in this segment are made in the heavy construction, general construction, mining and quarry and aggregates markets. After a strong start for our sales of construction machinery in 2012, uncertainties in the global economy had a moderating impact on customer demand. Dealer deliveries to end users were higher compared with 2011, but dealers began reducing their inventory in the second half of 2012 to align their inventory with end-user demand. As a result, our sales of construction machinery declined slightly when compared with 2011. Although our sales were higher in North America, lower sales in other regions, including Asia/Pacific, more than offset these increases. Customer demand for construction machinery has generally been characterized over the past decade by a shift from developed to developing economies. Customers in developing economies often prioritize purchase price in making their investment decisions, while customers in developed economies generally weigh productivity and other performance criteria that contribute to lower lifetime owning and operating costs of a machine. In response to increased demand in developing economies, Caterpillar has developed differentiated product offerings that target customers in those markets, including our SEM brand machines. We believe that these customer-driven product innovations enable us to compete more effectively in developing economies. In those developed economies that are subject to diesel engine emission requirements, we continued our multi-year roll out of products designed to meet those requirements. We believe that these products have been well-received by our customers and are providing us a competitive advantage.  In response to customer demand and our expectations for industry growth, we announced significant investment programs in 2010 and 2011 to increase our production of construction machinery, especially in the United States, Brazil and Asia. These investments are designed to better align our regional production capacity with customer demand. In August 2012, we began production of hydraulic excavators at a new facility in Victoria, Texas that will triple our U.S. production capacity for these machines when operating at full capacity. In light of global economic uncertainty and lower customer demand, we slowed other capacity increases and reduced production rates at several facilities. We also conducted targeted marketing programs to reduce inventory in certain markets, including China.  The competitive environment for construction machinery is characterized by some global competitors and many regional and specialized local competitors. Examples of global competitors include Komatsu Ltd., Volvo Construction Equipment (part of the Volvo Group), CNH Global N.V., Deere  Co., Hitachi Construction Machinery Co., J.C. Bamford Ltd., Doosan Infracore Co., Ltd. and Hyundai. As an example of regional and local competitors, our competitors in China also include LiuGong Machinery Co., Ltd., Longking Group, Sany Heavy Industry Co., Ltd., XiaGong Machinery Co. Ltd., XCMG Group, The Shandong Heavy Industry Group Co., Ltd. (Shantui Construction Machinery Co., Ltd., Strong Construction Machinery Co., Ltd., and Shandong JCM Construction Machinery Co., Ltd.), and Shandong Lingong Construction Machinery Co., Ltd. (part of Volvo Group). Each of these companies has varying product lines that compete with Caterpillar products, and each has varying degrees of regional focus.  The Construction Industries product portfolio includes the following machines and related parts:  ##TABLE_START    backhoe loaders    compact wheel loaders    small track-type tractors   small wheel loaders    track-type loaders   medium track-type tractors   skid steer loaders    mini excavators    select work tools   multi-terrain loaders    small, medium and large track excavators    motor graders  medium wheel loaders    wheel excavators    pipelayers ##TABLE_ENDResource Industries  The Resource Industries segment is primarily responsible for supporting customers using machinery in mine and quarry applications. It also serves forestry, paving, tunneling, industrial and waste customers. Our Resource Industries business was transformed by the acquisition of Bucyrus International, Inc. (Bucyrus) in July 2011, and now offers mining customers the broadest product range in the industry. We subsequently announced our intention to transition the Bucyrus distribution business to the independent Caterpillar dealers who support mining customers. We made significant progress integrating Bucyrus in 2012 and are working closely with our dealers to transition the distribution business, with twelve dealer transactions completed during the year.  Over the past two years, we have added capacity for mining products to better align production with expected demand. As a result of the increase in production capability, coupled with our existing mining order backlog, sales in 2012 were higher than 2011. However, in the second half of the year slow global growth and commodity prices that were off their 2012 highs resulted in some reductions, delays and cancellation of orders for mining products. We have continued our announced investments in new facilities and the expansion of existing facilities to increase capacity, but slowed the pace of these investments. We also completed the acquisition of ERA Mining Machinery Limited, including its wholly-owned subsidiary Zhengzhou Siwei Mechanical  Electrical Manufacturing Co., Ltd (Siwei), to pursue opportunities in the Chinese mid-tier market. Our investments reflect our belief that long-term trends of urbanization and related infrastructure development will support continued long-term mining industry growth.  The competitive environment for Resource Industries consists of a few larger global competitors that compete in several of the markets that we serve and a substantial number of smaller companies that compete in a more limited range of products and/or applications or in regional markets. Our global competitors include Komatsu Ltd., Joy Global Inc., Hitachi Construction Machinery Co., Ltd., Volvo Construction Equipment (part of Volvo Group), Atlas Copco, Wirtgen and Deere  Co. A number of Chinese companies are active in the mid-tier market, including Beijing Shougang Construction Group Co., Ltd., Chery Heavy Industry Co., Ltd., LiuGong Machinery Co., Ltd., Sany Heavy Industry Co., Ltd., XCMG Group and Zhengzhou Coal Mining Machinery Group Co., Ltd.  The Resource Industries product portfolio includes the following machines and related parts:  ##TABLE_START   electric rope shovels    large electric drive mining trucks    industrial swing machines   draglines    tunnel boring equipment    select work tools   hydraulic shovels    large wheel loaders    forestry products   drills    off-highway trucks    paving products   highwall miners    articulated trucks    machinery components   underground mining equipment    wheel tractor scrapers    electronics and control systems   large track-type tractors    wheel dozers     large mining trucks    compactors   ##TABLE_END Power Systems  Our Power Systems segment is primarily responsible for supporting customers using reciprocating engines, turbines and related parts across industries serving electric power, industrial, petroleum and marine applications as well as rail-related businesses. Power Systems sales increased globally in 2012, driven by increased customer demand, and included a full year of sales by MWM Holding GmbH (MWM).  The Power Systems portfolio includes: ##TABLE_START  reciprocating engine powered generator sets ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  integrated systems used in the electric power generation industry ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  reciprocating engines and integrated systems and solutions for the marine and petroleum industries ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  reciprocating engines supplied to the industrial industry as well as Caterpillar machinery ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  turbines and turbine-related services ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  diesel-electric locomotives and components and other rail-related products and services. ##TABLE_END  As in our other segments, customer demand for most Power Systems products and services has increased significantly in the developing world, and we have made investments to increase our production in line with regional demand. In 2012, we opened a new Electro-Motive Diesel, Inc. (EMD) manufacturing facility in Sete Lagoas, Brazil. In October 2011 we acquired MWM, a leading supplier of natural gas and alternative-fuel engines, in response to increasing customer demand for sustainable power alternatives. While sales of engines and turbines for petroleum applications increased in 2012, along with sales of our rail products and services, these increases were partially offset by lower sales for industrial and electric power generation, excluding MWM. In response to lower sales in certain markets, we announced reductions in our workforce at certain facilities. Power Systems remains focused on increasing its product offerings and further integrating its products and services to provide complete systems and solutions to its customers.  Regulatory emissions standards of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and similar standards in other developed economies have required us to make significant investments in research and development that will continue as new products are phased in over the next several years. This new product introduction process is the most extensive in the companys history. We believe that our emissions technology provides a competitive advantage in connection with emissions standards compliance and performance.  The competitive environment for reciprocating engines in marine, petroleum, construction, industrial, agriculture and electric power generation systems along with turbines consists of a few larger global competitors that compete in a variety of markets that Caterpillar serves, and a substantial number of smaller companies that compete in a limited-size product range, geographic region and/or application. Principal global competitors include Cummins Inc., Tognum AG, GE Oil  Gas, GE Power  Water, Deutz AG and Wartsila Corp. Other competitors, such as MAN Diesel  Turbo SE, Siemens Energy, Rolls Royce Group plc, Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Ltd., Volvo Penta (part of Volvo Group), Weichai Power Co., Ltd., Kirloskar Oil Engines Limited and other emerging market competitors compete in certain markets in which Caterpillar competes. An additional set of competitors, including Generac Power Systems, Inc., Kohler Co., and others, are packagers who source engines and/or other components from domestic and international suppliers and market products regionally and internationally through a variety of distribution channels. In rail-related businesses, our global competitors include GE Transportation, Vossloh AG, Siemens AG and Alstom Transport. We also compete with other companies on a more limited range of products, services and/or geographic regions.  Financial Products Segment  The business of our Financial Products segment is primarily conducted by Cat Financial, a wholly owned finance subsidiary of Caterpillar. Cat Financials primary business is to provide retail and wholesale financing alternatives for Caterpillar products to customers and dealers around the world. Retail financing is primarily comprised of the financing of Caterpillar equipment, machinery and engines. Cat Financial also provides financing for vehicles, power generation facilities and marine vessels that, in most cases, incorporate Caterpillar products. In addition to retail financing, Cat Financial provides wholesale financing to Caterpillar dealers and purchases short-term receivables from Caterpillar and its subsidiaries. The various financing plans offered by Cat Financial are primarily designed to increase the opportunity for sales of Caterpillar products and generate financing income for Cat Financial. A significant portion of Cat Financials activities is conducted in North America. However, Cat Financial has additional offices and subsidiaries in Asia, Australia, Europe and Latin America.  For over 30 years, Cat Financial has been providing financing in the various markets in which it participates, contributing to its knowledge of asset values, industry trends, product structuring and customer needs.  In certain instances, Cat Financials operations are subject to supervision and regulation by state, federal and various foreign governmental authorities, and may be subject to various laws and judicial and administrative decisions imposing requirements and restrictions which, among other things, (i) regulate credit granting activities and the administration of loans, (ii) establish maximum interest rates, finance charges and other charges, (iii) require disclosures to customers and investors, (iv) govern secured transactions, (v) set collection, foreclosure, repossession and other trade practices and (vi) regulate the use and reporting of information related to a borrowers credit experience. Cat Financials ability to comply with these and other governmental and legal requirements and restrictions affects its operations. Cat Financials retail leases and installment sale contracts (totaling 50 percent*) include:  ##TABLE_START  Tax leases that are classified as either operating or finance leases for financial accounting purposes, depending on the characteristics of the lease. For tax purposes, Cat Financial is considered the owner of the equipment (14 percent*). ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  Finance (non-tax) leases, where the lessee for tax purposes is considered to be the owner of the equipment during the term of the lease, that either require or allow the customer to purchase the equipment for a fixed price at the end of the term (19 percent*). ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  Installment sale contracts, which are equipment loans that enable customers to purchase equipment with a down payment or trade-in and structure payments over time (16 percent*). ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  Governmental lease-purchase plans in the U.S. that offer low interest rates and flexible terms to qualified non-federal government agencies (1 percent*). ##TABLE_END  Cat Financials wholesale notes receivable, finance leases and installment sale contracts (totaling 15 percent*) include:  ##TABLE_START  Inventory/rental programs, which provide assistance to dealers by financing their new Caterpillar inventory and rental fleets (5 percent*). ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  Short-term receivables Cat Financial purchased from Caterpillar at a discount (10 percent*). ##TABLE_END  Cat Financials retail notes receivables (35 percent*) include:  ##TABLE_START  Loans that allow customers and dealers to use their Caterpillar equipment or other assets as collateral to obtain financing. ##TABLE_END  _________________________________ *Indicates the percentage of Cat Financials total portfolio at December 31, 2012. We define total portfolio as total finance receivables (net of unearned income and allowance for credit losses) plus equipment on operating leases, less accumulated depreciation. For more information on the above and Cat Financials concentration of credit risk, please refer to Note 6  Cat Financial Financing Activities of Exhibit 13.  Cat Financial operates in a highly competitive environment, with financing for users of Caterpillar equipment available through a variety of sources, principally commercial banks and finance and leasing companies. Cat Financials competitors include Wells Fargo Equipment Finance Inc., General Electric Capital Corporation and various other banks and finance companies. In addition, many of our manufacturing competitors own financial subsidiaries such as Volvo Financial Services, Komatsu Financial L.P. and John Deere Capital Corporation that utilize below-market interest rate programs (funded by the manufacturer) to assist machine sales. Caterpillar and Cat Financial work together to provide a broad array of financial merchandising programs around the world to meet these competitive offers.  Cat Financials financial results are largely dependent upon the ability of Caterpillar dealers to sell equipment and customers willingness to enter into financing or leasing agreements. It is also affected by, among other things, the availability of funds from its financing sources, general economic conditions such as inflation and market interest rates and its cost of funds relative to its competitors.  Cat Financial has a match funding policy that addresses interest rate risk by aligning the interest rate profile (fixed rate or floating rate) of its debt portfolio with the interest rate profile of its receivables portfolio (loans and leases with customers and dealers) within predetermined ranges on an ongoing basis. In connection with that policy, Cat Financial issues debt with a similar interest rate profile to its receivables, and also uses interest rate swap agreements to manage its interest rate risk exposure to interest rate changes and in some cases to lower its cost of borrowed funds. For more information regarding match funding, please see Note 3  Derivative financial instruments and risk management of Exhibit 13. See also the risk factors on pages 9 through 18 for general risks associated with our financial products business included in Item 1A. of this Form 10-K. In managing foreign currency risk for Cat Financials operations, the objective is to minimize earnings volatility resulting from conversion and the remeasurement of net foreign currency balance sheet positions, and future transactions denominated in foreign currencies. This policy allows the use of foreign currency forward, option and cross currency contracts to offset the risk of currency mismatch between the receivable and debt portfolios, and exchange rate risk associated with future transactions denominated in foreign currencies. Substantially all such foreign currency forward, option and cross currency contracts are undesignated.  Cat Financial provides financing only when certain criteria are met. Credit decisions are based on, among other factors, the customers credit history, financial strength and intended use of equipment. Cat Financial typically maintains a security interest in retail-financed equipment and requires physical damage insurance coverage on financed equipment. Cat Financial finances a significant portion of Caterpillar dealers sales and inventory of Caterpillar equipment throughout the world. Cat Financials competitive position is improved by marketing programs offered in conjunction with Caterpillar and/or Caterpillar dealers. Under these programs, Caterpillar, or the dealer, funds an amount at the outset of the transaction, which Cat Financial then recognizes as revenue over the term of the financing. We believe that these marketing programs provide Cat Financial a significant competitive advantage in financing Caterpillar products.

Competitive Environment  Caterpillar products and product support services are sold worldwide into a variety of highly competitive markets. In all markets, we compete on the basis of product performance, customer service, quality and price. From time to time, the intensity of competition results in price discounting in a particular industry or region. Such price discounting puts pressure on margins and can negatively impact operating profit. Outside the United States, certain of our competitors enjoy competitive advantages inherent to operating in their home countries or regions.  Raw Materials and Component Products  We source our raw materials and manufactured components from suppliers both domestically and internationally. These purchases include unformed materials and rough and finished parts. Unformed materials include a variety of steel products, which are then cut or formed to shape and machined in our facilities. Rough parts include various sized steel and iron castings and forgings, which are machined to final specification levels inside our facilities. Finished parts are ready to assemble components, which are made either to Caterpillar specifications or to the supplier developed specifications. We machine and assemble some of the components used in our machines, engines and power generation units and to support our after-market dealer parts sales. We also purchase various goods and services used in production, logistics, offices and product development processes. We maintain global strategic sourcing models to meet our global facilities production needs while building long-term supplier relationships and leveraging enterprise spend. We expect our suppliers to maintain, at all times, industry-leading levels of quality and the ability to timely deliver raw materials and component products for our machine and engine products. We use a variety of agreements with suppliers to protect our intellectual property and processes to monitor and mitigate risks of the supply base causing a business disruption. The risks monitored include supplier financial viability, the ability to increase or decrease production levels, business continuity, quality and delivery.  Order Backlog  The dollar amount of backlog believed to be firm was approximately $19.6 billion, $29.8 billion and $18.7 billion at December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively. The total backlog decline occurred in Construction Industries, Resource Industries and Power Systems, with the most significant decrease in Resource Industries. Although dealer deliveries to end users were higher compared to 2011, Cat dealers lowered their order rates well below end-user demand to reduce their inventories. In 2011, order backlog increased by approximately $4.1 billion due to the acquisition of Bucyrus. The remaining increase for 2011 compared to 2010 year end was primarily due to an increase in volume across most business units. Of the total backlog, approximately $4.4 billion, $4.0 billion and $2.8 billion at December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively, was not expected to be filled in the following year. Dealers and Distributors  Our machines are distributed principally through a worldwide organization of dealers (dealer network), 48 located in the United States and 141 located outside the United States, serving 182 countries and operating 3,494 places of business, including 1,249 dealer rental outlets. Reciprocating engines are sold principally through the dealer network and to other manufacturers for use in their products. Some of the reciprocating engines manufactured by Perkins Engines Company Limited (Perkins) are also sold through its worldwide network of 107 distributors located in 189 countries. Most of the electric power generation systems manufactured by F.G. Wilson Engineering Limited (FG Wilson) are sold through its worldwide network of 172 distributors located in 116 countries. Some of the large, medium speed reciprocating engines are also sold under the MaK brand through a worldwide network of 19 distributors located in 130 countries.  Our dealers do not deal exclusively with our products; however, in most cases sales and servicing of our products are the dealers principal business. Turbines, locomotives and certain global mining products are sold through sales forces employed by the company. At times, these employees are assisted by independent sales representatives. While the large majority of our worldwide dealers are independently owned and operated, we own and operate three dealerships in Japan: Caterpillar East Japan Ltd., Caterpillar West Japan Ltd. and Caterpillar Tohoku Ltd. (Cat Tohoku) in the North. In March 2012, we completed the acquisition of Cat Tohoku. We are currently operating these Japanese dealers directly and their results are reported in the Construction Industries segment. There are also three independent dealers in the Southern Region of Japan.  For Caterpillar branded products, the companys relationship with each of its independent dealers is memorialized in a standard sales and service agreement. Pursuant to this agreement, the company grants the dealer the right to purchase and sell its products and to service the products in a specified geographic service territory. Prices to dealers are established by the company after receiving input from dealers on transactional pricing in the marketplace. The company also agrees to defend its intellectual property and to provide warranty and technical support to the dealer. The agreement further grants the dealer a non-exclusive license to use the companys trademarks, service marks and brand names. In some instances, a separate trademark agreement exists between the company and a dealer.  In exchange for these rights, the agreement obligates the dealer to develop and promote the sale of the companys products to current and prospective customers in the dealers service territory. Each dealer agrees to employ adequate sales and support personnel to market, sell and promote the companys products, demonstrate and exhibit the products, perform the companys product improvement programs, inform the company concerning any features that might affect the safe operation of any of the companys products and maintain detailed books and records of the dealers financial condition, sales and inventories and make these books and records available at the companys reasonable request.  These sales and service agreements are terminable at will by either party upon 90 days written notice and provide for termination automatically if the dealer files for bankruptcy protection or upon the occurrence of comparable action seeking protection from creditors.  Patents and Trademarks  Our products are sold primarily under the brands Caterpillar, CAT, design versions of CAT and Caterpillar, Electro-Motive, FG Wilson, MaK, MWM, Olympian, Perkins, Progress Rail, SEM and Solar Turbines. We own a number of patents and trademarks, which have been obtained over a period of years and relate to the products we manufacture and the services we provide. These patents and trademarks have been of value in the growth of our business and may continue to be of value in the future. We do not regard any of our business as being dependent upon any single patent or group of patents.  Research and Development  We have always placed strong emphasis on product-oriented research and development relating to the development of new or improved machines, engines and major components. In 2012, 2011 and 2010, we spent $2,466 million, $2,297 million and $1,905 million, or 3.7 percent, 3.8 percent, and 4.5 percent of our sales and revenues, respectively, on our research and development programs. Research and development expense is expected to decrease about 6 percent in 2013.  Employment  As of December 31, 2012, we employed 125,341 persons of whom 70,783 were located outside the United States. We build and maintain a productive, motivated workforce by striving to treat all employees fairly and equitably.  In the United States, most of our 54,558 employees are at-will employees and, therefore, not subject to any type of employment contract or agreement. At select business units, certain highly specialized employees have been hired under employment contracts that specify a term of employment and specify pay and other benefits. As of December 31, 2012, there were 13,666 U.S. hourly production employees who were covered by collective bargaining agreements with various labor unions. The United Automobile, Aerospace and Agricultural Implement Workers of America (UAW) represents 9,027 Caterpillar employees under a six-year central labor agreement that expires on March 1, 2017. The International Association of Machinists (IAM) represents 1,811 employees under labor agreements that will expire on May 17, 2015 and April 30, 2018. The United Steelworkers (USW) represents 1,213 employees under labor agreements that will expire on April 30, 2013, April 30, 2015 and August 19, 2018.  Outside the United States, the company enters into employment contracts and agreements in those countries in which such relationships are mandatory or customary. The provisions of these agreements correspond in each case with the required or customary terms in the subject jurisdiction.  Sales and Revenues  Sales and revenues outside the United States were 69 percent of consolidated sales and revenues for 2012, 70 percent for 2011 and 68 percent for 2010.  Environmental Matters  The company is regulated by federal, state and international environmental laws governing our use, transport and disposal of substances and control of emissions. In addition to governing our manufacturing and other operations, these laws often impact the development of our products, including, but not limited to, required compliance with air emissions standards applicable to internal combustion engines. We have made, and will continue to make, significant research and development and capital expenditures to comply with these emissions standards.  We are engaged in remedial activities at a number of locations, often with other companies, pursuant to federal and state laws. When it is reasonably probable we will pay remedial costs at a site, and those costs can be reasonably estimated, the costs are accrued against our earnings. In formulating that estimate, we do not consider amounts expected to be recovered from insurance companies or others. The amount recorded for environmental remediation is not material and is included in the line item Accrued expenses in Statement 3  Consolidated Financial Position at December 31 of Exhibit 13.  We cannot reasonably estimate costs at sites in the very early stages of remediation. Currently, we have a few sites in the very early stages of remediation, and there is no more than a remote chance that a material amount for remedial activities at any individual site, or at all sites in the aggregate, will be required.

Risk Factors. ##TABLE_END  The statements in this section describe the most significant risks to our business and should be considered carefully in conjunction with Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements of Exhibit 13 to this Form 10-K. In addition, the statements in this section and other sections of this Form 10-K include forward-looking statements as that term is defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and involve uncertainties that could significantly impact results. Forward-looking statements give current expectations or forecasts of future events about the company or our outlook. You can identify forward-looking statements by the fact they do not relate to historical or current facts and by the use of words such as believe, expect, estimate, anticipate, will be, should, plan, project, intend, could and similar words or expressions.  Forward-looking statements are based on assumptions and on known risks and uncertainties. Although we believe we have been prudent in our assumptions, any or all of our forward-looking statements may prove to be inaccurate, and we can make no guarantees about our future performance. Should known or unknown risks or uncertainties materialize or underlying assumptions prove inaccurate, actual results could materially differ from past results and/or those anticipated, estimated or projected. We undertake no obligation to publicly update forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. You should, however, consult any subsequent disclosures we make in our filings with the SEC on Form 10-Q or Form 8-K.  The following is a cautionary discussion of risks, uncertainties and assumptions that we believe are significant to our business. In addition to the factors discussed elsewhere in this report, the following are some of the important factors that, individually or in the aggregate, we believe could make our actual results differ materially from those described in any forward-looking statements. It is impossible to predict or identify all such factors and, as a result, you should not consider the following factors to be a complete discussion of risks, uncertainties and assumptions.  Our business is highly sensitive to global economic conditions and economic conditions in the industries and markets we serve.  Our results of operations are materially affected by conditions in the global economy generally and in various capital markets. The demand for our products and services tends to be cyclical and can be significantly reduced in an economic environment characterized by higher unemployment, lower consumer spending, lower corporate earnings and lower levels of government and business investment. A prolonged period of slow growth may also reduce demand for our products and services. Economic conditions vary across regions and countries, and demand for our products generally increases in those regions and countries experiencing economic growth and investment. A change in the global mix of regions and countries experiencing economic growth and investment could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.  The energy and mining industries are major users of our products, including the coal, iron ore, gold, copper, oil and natural gas industries. Decisions to purchase our products are dependent upon the performance of the industries in which our customers operate. If demand or output in these industries increases, the demand for our products will generally increase. Likewise, if demand or output in these industries declines, the demand for our products will generally decrease. Prices of commodities in these industries are frequently volatile and change in response to general economic conditions, economic growth, government actions, regulatory actions, commodity inventories and any disruptions in production or distribution. We assume certain prices for key commodities in preparing our general economic and financial outlooks (outlooks). Commodity prices lower than those assumed in our outlooks may negatively impact our business, results of operations and financial condition.  The rates of infrastructure spending, housing starts and commercial construction also play a significant role in our results. Our products are an integral component of these activities, and as these activities increase or decrease inside or outside of the United States, demand for our products may be significantly impacted, which could negatively impact our results. Slower rates of economic growth than anticipated in our outlooks could also adversely impact our business, results of operations and financial condition.  Changes in government monetary or fiscal policies may negatively impact our results .  Most countries have established central banks to regulate monetary systems and influence economic activities, generally by adjusting interest rates. Interest rate changes affect overall economic growth, which affects demand for residential and nonresidential structures, energy and mined products, which in turn affects sales of our products that serve these activities. Interest rate changes also affect our customers ability to finance machine purchases, can change the optimal time to keep machines in a fleet and can impact the ability of our suppliers to finance the production of parts and components necessary to manufacture and support our products. Our outlooks typically include assumptions about interest rates in a number of countries. Interest rates higher than those contained in our assumptions could result in lower sales than anticipated and supply chain inefficiencies.  Central banks and other policy arms of many countries take actions to vary the amount of liquidity and credit available in an economy. Liquidity and credit policies different from those assumed in our outlooks could impact the customers and markets we serve or our suppliers, which could adversely impact our business, results of operations and financial condition. Changes in monetary and fiscal policies, along with other factors, may cause currency exchange rates to fluctuate. Actions that lead the currency exchange rate of a country in which we manufacture products to increase relative to other currencies could reduce the competitiveness of products made in that country, which could adversely affect our competitive position, results of operations and financial condition. Government policies on taxes and spending also affect our business. Throughout the world, government spending finances a significant portion of infrastructure development, such as highways, airports, sewer and water systems and dams. Tax regulations determine depreciation lives and the amount of money users of our products can retain, both of which influence investment decisions. Unfavorable developments, such as declines in government revenues, decisions to reduce public spending or increases in taxes, could negatively impact our results.  Commodity or component price increases, fluctuations in demand for our products or significant shortages of component products may adversely impact our financial results or our ability to meet commitments to customers.  We are a significant user of steel and many other commodities required for the manufacture of our products. Unanticipated increases in the prices of such commodities would increase our costs, negatively impacting our business, results of operations and financial condition if we are unable to fully offset the effect of these increased costs through price increases, productivity improvements or cost reduction programs.  We rely on suppliers to secure component products, particularly steel, required for the manufacture of our products. A disruption in deliveries to or from suppliers or decreased availability of components or commodities could have an adverse effect on our ability to meet our commitments to customers or increase our operating costs. On the other hand, if demand for our products is less than we expect, we may experience excess inventories and be forced to incur additional charges and our profitability may suffer. Our business, competitive position, results of operations or financial condition could be negatively impacted if supply is insufficient for our operations. Our financial condition and results of operations may be negatively impacted if we experience excess inventories or we are unable to adjust our production schedules or our purchases from suppliers to reflect changes in customer demand and market fluctuations on a timely basis.  Disruptions or volatility in global financial markets could limit our sources of liquidity, or the liquidity of our customers, dealers and suppliers.  Global economic conditions may cause volatility and disruptions in the capital and credit markets. Although we generally generate funds from our operations to pay our operating expenses, fund our capital expenditures and support growth, fund our employee retirement benefit programs, pay dividends and buy back stock, continuing to meet these cash requirements over the long-term requires substantial liquidity and access to sources of funds, including capital and credit markets. Changes in global economic conditions, including material cost increases and decreases in economic activity in the markets that we serve, and the success of plans to manage cost increases, inventory and other important elements of our business may significantly impact our ability to generate funds from operations. Market volatility, changes in counterparty credit risk, the impact of government intervention in financial markets and general economic conditions may also adversely impact our ability to access capital and credit markets to fund operating needs. Global or regional economic downturns could cause financial markets to decrease the availability of liquidity, credit and credit capacity for certain issuers, including certain of our customers, dealers and suppliers. An inability to access capital and credit markets may have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and competitive position.  In addition, demand for our products generally depends on customers ability to pay for our products, which, in turn, depends on their access to funds. Subject to global economic conditions, customers may experience increased difficulty in generating funds from operations. Further, following capital and credit market volatility and uncertainty, many financial institutions have revised their lending standards, thereby decreasing access to capital. If capital and credit market volatility occurs, customers liquidity may decline which, in turn, would reduce their ability to purchase our products. Our global operations are exposed to political and economic risks, commercial instability and events beyond our control in the countries in which we operate.  Our global operations are dependent upon products manufactured, purchased and sold in the U.S. and internationally, including in countries with political and economic instability. In some cases, these countries have greater political and economic volatility and greater vulnerability to infrastructure and labor disruptions than in our other markets. Operating and seeking to expand business in a number of different regions and countries exposes us to a number of risks, including:  ##TABLE_START  multiple and potentially conflicting laws, regulations and policies that are subject to change; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  imposition of currency restrictions, restrictions on repatriation of earnings or other restraints; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  imposition of burdensome tariffs or quotas; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  national and international conflict, including terrorist acts; and ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  political and economic instability or civil unrest that may severely disrupt economic activity in affected countries. ##TABLE_END  The occurrence of one or more of these events may negatively impact our business, results of operations and financial condition.  Failure to maintain our credit ratings would increase our cost of borrowing and could adversely affect our access to capital markets.  Caterpillars and Cat Financials costs of borrowing and ability to access the capital markets are affected not only by market conditions but also by the short- and long-term debt ratings assigned to their debt by the major credit rating agencies. These ratings are based, in significant part, on Caterpillars and Cat Financials performance as measured by financial metrics such as net worth and interest coverage and leverage ratios, as well as transparency with rating agencies and timeliness of financial reporting. In 2009, two of the major credit rating agencies modified their outlook for Caterpillar and Cat Financial. Also in 2009, one major credit rating agency that had previously rated Caterpillar and Cat Financial slightly higher than the others downgraded its ratings to a comparable level and assigned a stable outlook. While the two rating agencies that had modified their outlooks subsequently improved their outlooks to stable, there can be no assurance that Caterpillars or Cat Financials credit ratings and/or outlooks will not be lowered in the future.  Although Caterpillar and Cat Financial have committed credit facilities to provide liquidity, any downgrades of our credit ratings may increase our cost of borrowing and could have an adverse effect on our access to the capital markets, including restricting, in whole or in part, our access to the commercial paper market. There can be no assurance that the commercial paper market will continue to be a reliable source of short-term financing for the company. An inability to access the capital markets could have an adverse effect on our cash flow, results of operations and financial condition.  Our Financial Products line of business is subject to risks associated with the financial services industry.  Cat Financial is significant to our operations and provides financing support to a significant share of our global sales. The inability of Cat Financial to access funds to support its financing activities to our customers could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. During the last global economic downturn, financial markets decreased the availability of liquidity, credit and credit capacity for certain issuers, including certain of Cat Financial's customers and our dealers and suppliers. Continuing to meet Cat Financial's cash requirements over the long-term could require substantial liquidity and access to sources of funds, including capital and credit markets. Cat Financial has continued to maintain access to key global medium term note and commercial paper markets, but there can be no assurance that such markets will continue to represent a reliable source of financing. If global economic conditions were to deteriorate, Cat Financial could face materially higher financing costs, become unable to access adequate funding to operate and grow its business and/or meet its debt service obligations as they mature, and be required to draw upon contractually committed lending agreements and/or by seeking other funding sources. However, under extreme market conditions, there can be no assurance that such agreements and other funding sources would be available or sufficient. Any of these events could negatively impact Cat Financials business, as well as our and Cat Financial's results of operations and financial condition.  Market disruption and volatility may also lead to a number of other risks in connection with these events, including but not limited to:  ##TABLE_START  Market developments that may affect customer confidence levels and cause declines in the demand for financing and adverse changes in payment patterns, causing increases in delinquencies and default rates, which could impact Cat Financials write-offs and provision for credit losses. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  The process Cat Financial uses to estimate losses inherent in its credit exposure requires a high degree of managements judgment regarding numerous subjective qualitative factors, including forecasts of economic conditions and how economic predictors might impair the ability of its borrowers to repay their loans. Financial market disruption and volatility may impact the accuracy of these judgments. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  Cat Financials ability to engage in routine funding transactions or borrow from other financial institutions on acceptable terms or at all could be adversely affected by disruptions in the capital markets or other events, including actions by rating agencies and deteriorating investor expectations. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  As Cat Financials counterparties are primarily financial institutions, their ability to perform in accordance with any of its underlying agreements could be adversely affected by market volatility and/or disruptions in financial markets. ##TABLE_END Changes in interest rates or market liquidity conditions could adversely affect Cat Financial's and our earnings and/or cash flow.  Changes in interest rates and market liquidity conditions could have an adverse effect on Cat Financial's and our earnings and cash flows. Because a significant number of the loans made by Cat Financial are made at fixed interest rates, its business is subject to fluctuations in interest rates. Changes in market interest rates may influence its financing costs, returns on financial investments and the valuation of derivative contracts and could reduce its and our earnings and cash flows. Although Cat Financial manages interest rate and market liquidity risks through a variety of techniques, including a match funding program, the selective use of derivatives and a broadly diversified funding program, there can be no assurance that fluctuations in interest rates and market liquidity conditions will not have an adverse effect on its and our earnings and cash flows. If any of the variety of instruments and strategies Cat Financial uses to hedge its exposure to these types of risk is ineffective, we may incur losses. With respect to Cat Insurance's investment activities, changes in the equity and bond markets could cause an impairment of the value of its investment portfolio, requiring a negative adjustment to earnings. An increase in delinquencies, repossessions or net losses of Cat Financial customers could adversely affect its results.  Inherent in the operation of Cat Financial is the credit risk associated with its customers. The creditworthiness of each customer and the rate of delinquencies, repossessions and net losses on customer obligations are directly impacted by several factors, including relevant industry and economic conditions, the availability of capital, the experience and expertise of the customer's management team, commodity prices, political events and the sustained value of the underlying collateral. Any increase in delinquencies, repossessions and net losses on customer obligations could have a material adverse effect on Cat Financial's and our earnings and cash flows. In addition, although Cat Financial evaluates and adjusts its allowance for credit losses related to past due and non-performing receivables on a regular basis, adverse economic conditions or other factors that might cause deterioration of the financial health of its customers could change the timing and level of payments received and thus necessitate an increase in Cat Financial's estimated losses, which could also have a material adverse effect on Cat Financial's and our earnings and cash flows.  Changes in financial services regulation could adversely impact Caterpillar and Cat Financial.  The U.S. Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Dodd-Frank) was signed into law in July 2010 and includes extensive provisions regulating the financial services industry. We continue to monitor and evaluate the impact of this legislation as regulators continue to propose, adopt and enforce the implementing rules. We are also monitoring other U.S. and international initiatives that further regulate the financial services industry. While many of the regulations implementing Dodd-Frank have not yet been adopted, these and other regulatory initiatives are expected to impose additional reporting, capital and other financial requirements that could result in significant costs or restrictions for Cat Financial or us and have an adverse effect on Cat Financial's and our results of operations and financial condition. We may not realize all of the anticipated benefits of our acquisitions, joint ventures or divestitures, or these benefits may take longer to realize than expected. In pursuing our business strategy, we routinely evaluate targets and enter into agreements regarding possible acquisitions, divestitures and joint ventures. We often compete with others for the same opportunities. To be successful, we conduct due diligence to identify valuation issues and potential loss contingencies, negotiate transaction terms, complete complex transactions and manage post-closing matters such as the integration of acquired businesses. Our due diligence reviews are subject to the completeness and accuracy of disclosures made by third parties. We may incur unanticipated costs or expenses following a completed acquisition, including post-closing asset impairment charges, expenses associated with eliminating duplicate facilities, litigation, and other liabilities. For example, as discussed in Note 23  \"Acquisitions\" of Exhibit 13, we recorded goodwill impairment of $580 million in 2012 related to our acquisition of Siwei. The risks associated with our past or future acquisitions also include the following:  ##TABLE_START  the business culture of the acquired business may not match well with our culture; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  technological and product synergies, economies of scale and cost reductions may not occur as expected; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  unforeseen expenses, delays or conditions may be imposed upon the acquisition, including due to required regulatory approvals or consents; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  we may acquire or assume unexpected liabilities or be subject to unexpected penalties or other enforcement actions; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  faulty assumptions may be made regarding the integration process; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  unforeseen difficulties may arise in integrating operations, processes and systems; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  higher than expected investments may be required to implement necessary compliance processes and related systems, including IT systems, accounting systems and internal controls over financial reporting; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  we may fail to retain, motivate and integrate key management and other employees of the acquired business; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  higher than expected costs may arise due to unforeseen changes in tax, trade, environmental, labor, safety, payroll or pension policies in any jurisdiction in which the acquired business conducts its operations; and ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  we may experience problems in retaining customers and integrating customer bases. ##TABLE_END Many of these factors will be outside of our control and any one of them could result in increased costs, decreases in the amount of expected revenues and diversion of managements time and attention. They may also delay the realization of the benefits we anticipate when we enter into a transaction.  In order to conserve cash for operations, we may undertake acquisitions financed in part through public offerings or private placements of debt or equity securities, or other arrangements. Such acquisition financing could result in a decrease of our ratio of earnings to fixed charges and adversely affect other leverage measures. If we issue equity securities or equity-linked securities, the issued securities may have a dilutive effect on the interests of the holders of our common shares.  Failure to implement our acquisition strategy, including successfully integrating acquired businesses, could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Furthermore, we make strategic divestitures from time to time, including the ongoing divestiture of the Bucyrus distribution business to our independent dealers. In the case of divestitures, we may agree to indemnify acquiring parties for certain liabilities arising from our former businesses. These divestitures may also result in continued financial involvement in the divested businesses, including through guarantees or other financial arrangements, following the transaction. Lower performance by those divested businesses could affect our future financial results.  International trade policies may impact demand for our products and our competitive position.  Government policies on international trade and investment such as import quotas, capital controls or tariffs, whether adopted by individual governments or addressed by regional trade blocs, can affect the demand for our products and services, impact the competitive position of our products or prevent us from being able to sell products in certain countries. The implementation of more restrictive trade policies, such as more detailed inspections, higher tariffs or new barriers to entry, in countries in which we sell large quantities of products and services could negatively impact our business, results of operations and financial condition. For example, a governments adoption of buy national policies or retaliation by another government against such policies could have a negative impact on our results of operations.  The success of our business depends on our ability to develop, produce and market quality products that meet our customers needs.  Our business relies on continued global demand for our brands and products. To achieve business goals, we must develop and sell products that appeal to our dealers, OEMs and customers. This is dependent on a number of factors, including our ability to maintain key dealer relationships, our ability to produce products that meet the quality, performance and price expectations of our customers and our ability to develop effective sales, advertising and marketing programs. In addition, our continued success in selling products that appeal to our customers is dependent on leading-edge innovation, with respect to both products and operations, and on the availability and effectiveness of legal protection for our innovation. Failure to continue to deliver high quality, innovative, competitive products to the marketplace, to adequately protect our intellectual property rights, to supply products that meet applicable regulatory requirements, including EPA Tier 4 Interim and Tier 4 Final diesel engine emission requirements and equivalent standards in the EU, Israel, Japan and Canada (Tier 4), or to predict market demands for, or gain market acceptance of, our products, could have a negative impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition. We operate in a highly competitive environment, which could adversely affect our sales and pricing.  We operate in a highly competitive environment, and our outlook depends on a forecast of our share of industry sales based on our ability to compete with others in the marketplace. We compete on the basis of product performance, customer service, quality and price. There can be no assurance that our products will be able to compete successfully with other companies products. Thus, our share of industry sales could be reduced due to aggressive pricing or product strategies pursued by competitors, unanticipated product or manufacturing difficulties, our failure to price our products competitively, our failure to produce our products at a competitive cost or an unexpected buildup in competitors new machine or dealer-owned rental fleets, leading to severe downward pressure on machine rental rates and/or used equipment prices.  Our sales outlook assumes that certain price increases we announce from time to time will hold in the marketplace. Changes in market acceptance of price increases, changes in market requirements for price discounts or changes in our competitors behavior could have an adverse impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition.  In addition, our results and ability to compete may be impacted negatively by changes in our sales mix. Our outlook assumes a certain geographic mix of sales as well as a product mix of sales. If actual results vary from this projected geographic and product mix of sales, our results could be negatively impacted.  We may not realize all of the anticipated benefits from capacity expansion projects, cost-reduction initiatives, cash flow improvement initiatives and efficiency or productivity initiatives, including the Caterpillar Production System (CPS).  We are implementing a number of capacity expansion projects to meet expected customer demand and to expand our share of industry sales. There can be no assurance that these projects will succeed in meeting customer demand or that the benefits expected from these projects will be realized as anticipated or at all. If we overestimate customer demand, we may have underutilized assets and we may experience reduced margins. Certain of our competitors have also announced investments to increase capacity. Industry overcapacity could contribute to a weak pricing environment, which could have an adverse impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition.  We are also actively engaged in a number of initiatives to increase our productivity, efficiency and cash flow and to reduce costs, which have had a positive effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. CPS is a productivity initiative that aims to improve our order-to-delivery processes and factory efficiency, as well as to reduce waste and maximize value for our customers. We are also in the process of implementing a new operating and financial reporting system in many of our businesses to increase efficiency and harmonize our operations and reporting. There can be no assurance that these systems and initiatives or others will continue to be beneficial to the extent anticipated, or that the estimated efficiency improvements, incremental cost savings or cash flow improvements will be realized as anticipated or at all. If our new operating and reporting system is not implemented successfully, it could have an adverse effect on our operations and results of operations, including our ability to report accurate and timely financial results.  Our business is subject to the inventory management decisions and sourcing practices of our dealers and our OEM customers.  We sell finished products through an independent dealer network and directly to OEMs and are subject to risks relating to their inventory management decisions and sourcing practices. Both carry inventories of finished products as part of ongoing operations and adjust those inventories based on their assessments of future needs. Such adjustments may impact our results positively or negatively. If the inventory levels of our dealers and OEM customers are higher than desired, they may postpone product purchases from us, which may negatively impact our results. Similarly, our results could be negatively impacted through the loss of time-sensitive sales if our dealers and OEM customers do not maintain inventory levels sufficient to meet customer demand. Additionally, some of our engine customers are OEMs that manufacture or could in the future manufacture engines for their own products. Despite their engine manufacturing abilities, these customers have chosen to outsource certain types of engine production to us due to the quality of our engine products and in order to reduce costs, eliminate production risks and maintain company focus. However, we cannot assure that these customers will continue to outsource engine manufacture in the future. Decreased levels of production outsourcing by these customers could result from a number of factors, such as shifts in our customers business strategies, acquisition by a customer of another engine manufacturer, the inability of third-party suppliers to meet specifications and the emergence of low-cost production opportunities in foreign countries. A significant reduction in the level of engine production outsourcing from our OEM customers could significantly impact our revenues and, accordingly, have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. We are subject to stringent environmental laws and regulations that impose significant compliance costs.  Our facilities, operations and products are subject to increasingly stringent environmental laws and regulations, including laws and regulations governing emissions to air, discharges to water and the generation, handling, storage, transportation, treatment and disposal of non-hazardous and hazardous waste materials. We cannot provide assurances that we will not be adversely affected by costs, liabilities or claims with respect to existing or subsequently acquired operations or under present laws and regulations or those that may be adopted or imposed in the future.  Our engines are subject to extensive statutory and regulatory requirements governing exhaust emissions and noise, including standards imposed by the EPA, state regulatory agencies in the United States and other regulatory agencies around the world. For instance, national, state or local governments may set new emissions standards that could impact our products and operations in ways that are difficult to anticipate with accuracy. Thus, significant changes in standards, or the adoption of new standards, have the potential to negatively impact our business, results of operations, financial condition and competitive position.  Our global operations are subject to extensive trade and anti-corruption laws and regulations.  Due to the international scope of our operations, we are subject to a complex system of import- and export-related laws and regulations, including U.S. regulations issued by Customs and Border Protection, the Bureau of Industry and Security, the Office of Antiboycott Compliance, the Directorate of Defense Trade Controls and the Office of Foreign Assets Control, as well as the counterparts of these agencies in other countries. Any alleged or actual violations may subject us to government scrutiny, investigation and civil and criminal penalties, and may limit our ability to import or export our products or to provide services outside the United States. We cannot predict the nature, scope or effect of future regulatory requirements to which our operations might be subject or the manner in which existing laws might be administered or interpreted.  In addition, the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and similar foreign anti-corruption laws generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments or providing anything of value to improperly influence foreign government officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business, or obtaining an unfair advantage. Recent years have seen a substantial increase in the global enforcement of anti-corruption laws. Our continued operation and expansion outside the United States, including in developing countries, could increase the risk of such violations. Violations of these laws may result in severe criminal or civil sanctions, could disrupt our business, and result in an adverse effect on our reputation, business and results of operations or financial condition.  Moreover, several of our joint venture partners are domiciled in areas of the world with laws, rules and business practices that differ from those in the United States. Although we strive to select joint venture partners who share our values and understand our reporting requirements as a U.S.-domiciled company and to ensure that an appropriate business culture exists within these ventures to minimize and mitigate our risk, we nonetheless face the reputational and legal risk that our joint venture partners will violate applicable laws, rules and business practices.  We may incur additional tax expense or become subject to additional tax exposure.  We are subject to income taxes in the United States and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Our domestic and international tax liabilities are dependent upon the location of earnings among these different jurisdictions. Our provision for income taxes and cash tax liability in the future could be adversely affected by numerous factors, including income before taxes being lower than anticipated in countries with lower statutory tax rates and higher than anticipated in countries with higher statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, as well as, changes in tax laws and regulations. We are also subject to the continuous examination of our income tax returns by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities. The results of audit and examination of previously filed tax returns and continuing assessments of our tax exposures may have an adverse effect on the companys provision for income taxes and cash tax liability. Currency exchange rate fluctuations affect our results of operations, as reported in our financial statements.  We conduct operations in many areas of the world, involving transactions denominated in a variety of currencies. We are subject to currency exchange rate risk to the extent that our costs are denominated in currencies other than those in which we earn revenues. In addition, because our financial statements are reported in U.S. dollars, changes in currency exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and other currencies have had, and will continue to have, an impact on our results of operations. While we customarily enter into financial transactions to address these risks, there can be no assurance that currency exchange rate fluctuations will not adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. In addition, while the use of currency hedging instruments may provide us with protection from adverse fluctuations in currency exchange rates, by utilizing these instruments we potentially forego the benefits that might result from favorable fluctuations in currency exchange rates.  We also face risks arising from the imposition of exchange controls and currency devaluations. Exchange controls may limit our ability to convert foreign currencies into U.S. dollars or to remit dividends and other payments by our foreign subsidiaries or businesses located in or conducted within a country imposing controls. Currency devaluations result in a diminished value of funds denominated in the currency of the country instituting the devaluation.  Restrictive covenants in our debt agreements could limit our financial and operating flexibility.  We maintain a number of credit facilities to support general corporate purposes (facilities) and have issued debt securities to manage liquidity and fund operations (debt securities). The agreements relating to a number of the facilities and the debt securities contain certain restrictive covenants applicable to us and certain of our subsidiaries, including Cat Financial. These covenants include maintaining a consolidated net worth (defined as the consolidated stockholders equity including preferred stock but excluding the pension and other post-retirement benefits balance within accumulated other comprehensive income (loss)) of not less than $9 billion, limitations on the incurrence of liens and certain restrictions on consolidation and merger. Cat Financial has also agreed under certain of these agreements to maintain a leverage ratio (consolidated debt to consolidated net worth, calculated (1) on a monthly basis as the average of the leverage ratios determined on the last day of each of the six preceding calendar months and (2) at each December 31) not greater than 10.0 to 1, to maintain a minimum interest coverage ratio (profit excluding income taxes, interest expense and net gain/(loss) from interest rate derivatives to interest expense, calculated at the end of each calendar quarter for the rolling four quarter period then most recently ended) of not less than 1.15 to 1 and not to terminate, amend or modify its support agreement with us.  A breach of one or more of the covenants could result in adverse consequences that could negatively impact our business, results of operations and financial condition. These consequences may include the acceleration of amounts outstanding under certain of the facilities, triggering of an obligation to redeem certain debt securities, termination of existing unused commitments by our lenders, refusal by our lenders to extend further credit under one or more of the facilities or to enter into new facilities or the lowering or modification of our credit ratings or those of one or more of our subsidiaries.  Sustained increases in funding obligations under our pension plans may reduce our profitability.  We maintain certain defined benefit pension plans for our employees, which impose on us certain funding obligations. In determining our future payment obligations under the plans, we assume certain rates of return on the plan assets and growth rates of certain costs. Significant adverse changes in credit or capital markets could result in actual rates of return being materially lower than projected and increased pension expense in future years. We may be required to make contributions to our pension plans in the future, and these contributions could be material. Our cost growth rates may also be materially higher than projected. These factors could significantly increase our payment obligations under the plans, require us to take a significant charge on our balance sheet and, as a result, adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.  Union disputes or other labor matters could adversely affect our operations and financial results .  Some of our employees are represented by labor unions in a number of countries under various collective bargaining agreements with varying durations and expiration dates. There can be no assurance that any current or future issues with our employees will be resolved or that we will not encounter future strikes, work stoppages or other types of conflicts with labor unions or our employees. We may not be able to satisfactorily renegotiate collective bargaining agreements in the United States and other countries when they expire. If we fail to renegotiate our existing collective bargaining agreements, we could encounter strikes or work stoppages or other types of conflicts with labor unions. In addition, existing collective bargaining agreements may not prevent a strike or work stoppage at our facilities in the future. We may also be subject to general country strikes or work stoppages unrelated to our business or collective bargaining agreements. A work stoppage or other limitations on production at our facilities for any reason could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. In addition, many of our customers and suppliers have unionized work forces. Strikes or work stoppages experienced by our customers or suppliers could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.  Costs associated with lawsuits or investigations or increases in the reserves we establish based on our assessment of contingencies may have an adverse effect on our results of operations.  We face an inherent business risk of exposure to various types of claims and lawsuits. We are involved in various intellectual property, product liability, product warranty and environmental claims and lawsuits and other legal proceedings that arise in and outside of the ordinary course of our business. The industries in which we operate are also periodically reviewed or investigated by regulators, which could lead to enforcement actions, fines and penalties or the assertion of private litigation claims. It is not possible to predict with certainty the outcome of claims, investigations and lawsuits, and we could in the future incur judgments, fines or penalties or enter into settlements of lawsuits and claims that could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition in any particular period. In addition, while we maintain insurance coverage with respect to certain claims, we may not be able to obtain such insurance on acceptable terms in the future, if at all, and any such insurance may not provide adequate coverage against any such claims.  As required by U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), we establish reserves based on our assessment of contingencies, including contingencies related to legal claims asserted against us. Subsequent developments in legal proceedings may affect our assessment and estimates of the loss contingency recorded as a reserve and require us to make payments in excess of our reserves, which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations.  Additional carbon emissions constraints may impact our capital expenditures, results of operations and competitive position.  The potential for government-mandated reductions of carbon emissions from our facilities and products is increasing. Mandatory legislative, regulatory and/or policy-based constraints are being implemented or considered by many jurisdictions. For example, the EPA has promulgated regulations governing carbon emissions from automobiles and heavy-duty on-highway diesel vehicles, which may lead to regulation of other mobile sources. Although various attempts to pass comprehensive legislation reducing carbon emissions have been unsuccessful in the United States, the EPA has also proceeded with regulating carbon emissions from stationary sources under existing law. The final details and scope of these various legislative, regulatory and policy measures around the world are unclear and their potential impact is still uncertain, so we cannot fully predict the impact on us. However, should legislation or regulations be adopted imposing significant operational restrictions and compliance requirements upon us or our products, they could negatively impact our capital expenditures, results of operations and competitive position.  Changes in accounting guidance could have an adverse effect on our results of operations, as reported in our financial statements.  Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with GAAP, which is periodically revised and/or expanded. Accordingly, from time to time we are required to adopt new or revised accounting guidance and related interpretations issued by recognized authoritative bodies, including the Financial Accounting Standards Board and the SEC. Market conditions have prompted these organizations to issue new guidance that further interprets or seeks to revise accounting pronouncements related to various transactions as well as to issue new guidance expanding disclosures. The impact of accounting pronouncements that have been issued but not yet implemented is disclosed in this annual report on Form 10-K and our quarterly reports on Form 10-Q. An assessment of proposed standards is not provided, as such proposals are subject to change through the exposure process and, therefore, their effects on our financial statements cannot be meaningfully assessed. It is possible that future accounting guidance we are required to adopt could change the current accounting treatment that we apply to our consolidated financial statements and that such changes could have an adverse effect on our results of operations, as reported in our consolidated financial statements.  Increased information technology security threats and more sophisticated computer crime pose a risk to our systems, networks, products and services.  We rely upon information technology systems and networks in connection with a variety of business activities, some of which are managed by third parties. Additionally, we collect and store data that is sensitive to Caterpillar. The secure operation of these information technology systems and networks, and the processing and maintenance of this data is critical to our business operations and strategy. Information technology security threats -- from user error to attacks designed to gain unauthorized access to our systems, networks and data -- are increasing in frequency and sophistication. Attacks may range from random attempts to coordinated and targeted attacks, including sophisticated computer crime and advanced persistent threats. These threats pose a risk to the security of our systems and networks and the confidentiality, availability and integrity of our data. We have identified attempts to gain unauthorized access to our information technology systems and networks. To our knowledge, no such attack was ultimately successful in exporting sensitive data or controlling sensitive systems or networks. Should such an attack succeed it could expose us and our customers, dealers and suppliers to misuse of information or systems, the compromising of confidential information, manipulation and destruction of data, defective products, production downtimes and operations disruptions. The occurrence of any of these events could adversely affect our reputation, competitive position, business and results of operations. In addition, such breaches in security could result in litigation, regulatory action and potential liability and the costs and operational consequences of implementing further data protection measures.  Unexpected events, including natural disasters, may increase our cost of doing business or disrupt our operations.  The occurrence of one or more unexpected events, including fires, tornadoes, tsunamis, hurricanes, earthquakes, floods and other forms of severe weather in the United States or in other countries in which we operate or in which our suppliers are located could adversely affect our operations and financial performance. Natural disasters, pandemic illness, equipment failures, power outages or other unexpected events could result in physical damage to and complete or partial closure of one or more of our manufacturing facilities or distribution centers, temporary or long-term disruption in the supply of component products from some local and international suppliers, disruption in the transport of our products to dealers and end-users and delay in the delivery of our products to our distribution centers. Existing insurance arrangements may not provide protection for all of the costs that may arise from such events. ##TABLE_START ", "1B": " Item 1B.

The aggregate range of reasonably possible losses in excess of accrued liabilities, if any, associated with these unresolved legal actions is not material. In some cases, we cannot reasonably estimate a range of loss because there is insufficient information regarding the matter. However, there is no more than a remote chance that any liability arising from these matters would be material.

Based on that evaluation, the company's management, including the CEO and CFO concluded that the company's disclosure controls and procedures are effective as of the end of the period covered by this annual report.  Managements Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting The management of Caterpillar Inc. (company) is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act. Our internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of our financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Our internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.  Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.  Management assessed the effectiveness of the companys internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2012. In making this assessment, we used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework . Based on our assessment we concluded that, as of December 31, 2012, the companys internal control over financial reporting was effective based on those criteria.  Management has excluded ERA Mining Machinery Limited, including its wholly-owned subsidiary Zhengzhou Siwei Mechanical Manufacturing Co., Ltd., commonly known as Siwei, from our assessment of internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2012 because we acquired Siwei in May 2012. Siwei is a wholly owned subsidiary of Caterpillar Inc. whose total assets and total sales and revenues represent approximately 1 percent and less than 1 percent, respectively, of the related consolidated financial statement amounts as of and for the year ended December 31, 2012.  The effectiveness of the companys internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2012 has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm. Their report appears on page A-4 of Exhibit 13. Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting  During the last fiscal quarter, there has been no significant change in the companys internal control over financial reporting that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the companys internal control over financial reporting, except as noted below.  During 2012, we acquired 100 percent of the equity in Siwei. As part of the post-closing integration, we are engaged in refining and harmonizing the internal controls and processes of the acquired business with those of the company. Management has excluded the internal controls of Siwei from its annual assessment of the effectiveness of the companys internal control over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 for 2012. This exclusion is in accordance with the general guidance issued by the Securities and Exchange Commission that an assessment of a recent business combination may be omitted from managements report on internal control over financial reporting in the year of acquisition.  ##TABLE_START ", "9B": " Item 9B.

Business. ##TABLE_END  General  Originally organized as Caterpillar Tractor Co. in 1925 in the State of California, our company was reorganized as Caterpillar Inc. in 1986 in the State of Delaware. As used herein, the term Caterpillar, we, us, our, or the company refers to Caterpillar Inc. and its subsidiaries unless designated or identified otherwise.  Overview  With 2013 sales and revenues of $55.656 billion, Caterpillar is the worlds leading manufacturer of construction and mining equipment, diesel and natural gas engines, industrial gas turbines and diesel-electric locomotives. The company principally operates through its three product segments - Resource Industries, Construction Industries, and Power Systems - and also provides financing and related services through its Financial Products segment. Caterpillar is also a leading U.S. exporter. Through a global network of independent dealers and direct sales of certain products, Caterpillar builds long-term relationships with customers around the world.  Currently, we have five operating segments, of which four are reportable segments and are described below. Further information about our reportable segments, including geographic information, appears in Note 23  Segment information of Exhibit 13.  Categories of Business Organization  1.   Machinery and Power Systems  Represents the aggregate total of Construction Industries, Resource Industries, Power Systems and the All Other segment and related corporate items and eliminations.  2.   Financial Products  Primarily includes the companys Financial Products Segment. This category includes Cat Financial, Caterpillar Financial Insurance Services (Insurance Services) and their respective subsidiaries.  Other information about our operations in 2013, including certain risks associated with our operations, is incorporated by reference from our Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in Exhibit 13.  Construction Industries  Our Construction Industries segment is primarily responsible for supporting customers using machinery in infrastructure and building construction applications. The majority of machine sales in this segment are made in the heavy construction, general construction, mining and quarry and aggregates markets. Although the worldwide construction industry in 2013 was depressed from a historical standpoint, it showed some signs of improvement as the year progressed and order rates improved. Construction Industries sales declined slightly in 2013 from 2012. Over half of the sales decrease was due to the unfavorable impact of currency primarily from a weaker Japanese yen. In addition, volume was lower primarily from changes in dealer machine inventory. In 2013, our sales declined in EAME and Asia/Pacific while North America and Latin America were about flat.   Customer demand for construction machinery has generally been characterized over the past decade by a shift from developed to developing economies. Customers in developing economies often prioritize purchase price in making their investment decisions, while customers in developed economies generally weigh productivity and other performance criteria that contribute to lower lifetime owning and operating costs of a machine. In response to increased demand in developing economies, Caterpillar has developed differentiated product offerings that target customers in those markets, including our SEM brand machines. We believe that these customer-driven product innovations enable us to compete more effectively in developing economies. In those developed economies that are subject to diesel engine emission requirements, we continued our multi-year roll out of products designed to meet those requirements. We believe that these products have been well-received by our customers and are providing us a competitive advantage.  In order to better align our regional production capacity with customer demand, we began production in 2013 at our Rayong, Thailand and Athens, Georgia USA facilities. Given the uncertainty in the global economy, we slowed other capacity increases and reduced production rates at several facilities during 2013. We also conducted targeted marketing programs to reduce inventory in certain markets, including China.  The competitive environment for construction machinery is characterized by some global competitors and many regional and specialized local competitors. Examples of global competitors include Komatsu Ltd., Volvo Construction Equipment (part of the Volvo Group), CNH Global Industrial N.V., Deere  Company, Hitachi Construction Machinery Co. Ltd., J.C. Bamford Excavators Ltd., Doosan Infracore Co. Ltd., and Hyundai Construction Equipment (part of Hyundai Heavy Industries). As an example of regional and local competitors, our competitors in China also include Guangxi LiuGong Machinery Co. Ltd., Longking Holdings Ltd., Sany Heavy Industry Co. Ltd., Xiamen XGMA Machinery Co. Ltd., XCMG Group, The Shandong Heavy Industry Group Co., Ltd. (Shantui Construction Machinery Co. Ltd.), Strong Construction Machinery Co. Ltd., and Shandong Lingong Construction Machinery Co. Ltd. (part of Volvo Group). Each of these companies has varying product lines that compete with Caterpillar products, and each has varying degrees of regional focus.  The Construction Industries product portfolio includes the following machines and related parts:  ##TABLE_START    backhoe loaders    compact wheel loaders    small track-type tractors   small wheel loaders    track-type loaders   medium track-type tractors   skid steer loaders    mini excavators    select work tools   multi-terrain loaders    small, medium and large track excavators    motor graders  medium wheel loaders    wheel excavators    compact track loaders   pipelayers   ##TABLE_ENDResource Industries  The Resource Industries segment is primarily responsible for supporting customers using machinery in mine and quarry applications. As a result of the acquisition of Bucyrus International, Inc. (Bucyrus) in July 2011, Caterpillar is able to offer mining customers the broadest product range in the industry. Resource Industries continues to transition the former Bucyrus distribution business to the independent Caterpillar dealers who support mining customers, with nineteen dealer transactions completed during the year. In 2013, Resource Industries also served forestry, paving, tunneling, industrial and waste customers. Due to an internal reorganization, these products were reorganized out of Resource Industries effective January 1, 2014 and is now included in the All Other operating segments. Resource Industries sales declined significantly in 2013, almost all from lower sales volume attributable to declines in dealer inventories and lower end-user demand. Although production of most mined commodities is near or above a year ago, mining customers in all geographic regions reduced capital spending which resulted in lower demand for our mining products. Dealers also reduced machine inventories during the year to better align their inventory levels with expected demand. Cost management was a key element of Resource Industries strategy in 2013. The significant decline in sales resulted in substantial actions to lower production, cost and employment. Actions taken during the year included temporary plant shutdowns, global workforce reductions, temporary layoffs of salaried and management employees, reductions in program and discretionary spending and substantially lower incentive pay. In order to be well-positioned when the mining industry improves, we are continuing our efforts to reduce costs, but are not expecting to make substantial changes in physical capacity. The competitive environment for Resource Industries consists of a few larger global competitors that compete in several of the markets that we serve and a substantial number of smaller companies that compete in a more limited range of products, applications, and regional markets. Our global competitors include Komatsu Ltd., Joy Global Inc., Hitachi Construction Machinery Co., Ltd., Volvo Construction Equipment (part of Volvo Group), Atlas Copco, Sandvik Mining, Wirtgen, and Deere  Co. A number of Chinese companies are active in the mid-tier market, including LiuGong Machinery Co., Ltd., XCMG Group and Zhengzhou Coal Mining Machinery Group Co., Ltd. The Resource Industries product portfolio includes the following machines and related parts:  ##TABLE_START   electric rope shovels    large track-type tractors    wheel tractor scrapers   draglines    large mining trucks    wheel dozers   hydraulic shovels    longwall miners    machinery components   drills    large wheel loaders    electronics and control systems   highwall miners    off-highway trucks     hard rock vehicles    articulated trucks   ##TABLE_END Power Systems  Our Power Systems segment is primarily responsible for supporting customers using reciprocating engines, turbines and related parts across industries serving electric power, industrial, petroleum and marine applications as well as rail-related businesses.  In September 2013, we acquired Johan Walter Berg AB (Berg). Berg is a leading manufacturer of mechanically and electrically driven propulsion systems and marine controls for ships. Headquartered in cker Islands, Sweden, Berg has designed and manufactured heavy-duty marine thrusters and controllable pitch propellers since 1929. Its proprietary systems are employed in maritime applications throughout the world that require precise maneuvering and positioning. With the acquisition, Caterpillar will transition from selling only engines and generators to providing complete marine propulsion package systems.  Sales of engines decreased in 2013, primarily due to lower volume in electric power, petroleum and rail applications. Power Systems remains focused on increasing its product offerings and further integrating its products and services to provide complete systems and solutions to its customers.  Regulatory emissions standards of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and similar standards in other developed economies have required us to make significant investments in research and development that will continue as new products are phased in over the next several years. This new product introduction process is the most extensive in our history. We believe that our emissions technology provides a competitive advantage in connection with emissions standards compliance and performance.  The competitive environment for reciprocating engines in marine, petroleum, construction, industrial, agriculture and electric power generation systems along with turbines consists of a few larger global competitors that compete in a variety of markets that Caterpillar serves, and a substantial number of smaller companies that compete in a limited-size product range, geographic region and/or application. Principal global competitors include Cummins Inc., Rolls-Royce Power System AG (formerly Tognum AG), GE Oil  Gas, GE Power  Water, Deutz AG and Wartsila Corp. Other competitors, such as MAN Diesel  Turbo SE, Siemens Energy, Rolls-Royce Energy, Rolls-Royce Marine, Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Ltd., Volvo Penta (part of Volvo Group), Weichai Power Co., Ltd., Kirloskar Oil Engines Limited and other emerging market competitors compete in certain markets in which Caterpillar competes. An additional set of competitors, including Generac Power Systems, Inc., Kohler Co., Aggreko PLC and others, are packagers who source engines and/or other components from domestic and international suppliers and market products regionally and internationally through a variety of distribution channels. In rail-related businesses, our global competitors include GE Transportation, Vossloh AG, Siemens AG and Alstom Transport, and Voestalpine AG. We also compete with other companies on a more limited range of products, services and/or geographic regions. The Power Systems product portfolio includes the following: ##TABLE_START  reciprocating engine powered generator sets ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  reciprocating engines supplied to the industrial industry as well as Caterpillar machinery ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  integrated systems used in the electric power generation industry ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  turbines and turbine-related services ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  reciprocating engines and integrated systems and solutions for the marine and petroleum industries ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  diesel-electric locomotives and components and other rail-related products and services ##TABLE_END   Financial Products Segment  The business of our Financial Products segment is primarily conducted by Cat Financial, a wholly owned finance subsidiary of Caterpillar. Cat Financials primary business is to provide retail and wholesale financing alternatives for Caterpillar products to customers and dealers around the world. Retail financing is primarily comprised of the financing of Caterpillar equipment, machinery and engines. Cat Financial also provides financing for vehicles, power generation facilities and marine vessels that, in most cases, incorporate Caterpillar products. In addition to retail financing, Cat Financial provides wholesale financing to Caterpillar dealers and purchases short-term receivables from Caterpillar and its subsidiaries. The various financing plans offered by Cat Financial are primarily designed to increase the opportunity for sales of Caterpillar products and generate financing income for Cat Financial. A significant portion of Cat Financials activities is conducted in North America. Cat Financial also has additional offices and subsidiaries in Asia/Pacific, Europe and Latin America.  For over 30 years, Cat Financial has been providing financing in the various markets in which it participates, contributing to its knowledge of asset values, industry trends, product structuring and customer needs.  In certain instances, Cat Financials operations are subject to supervision and regulation by state, federal and various foreign governmental authorities, and may be subject to various laws and judicial and administrative decisions imposing requirements and restrictions which, among other things, (i) regulate credit granting activities and the administration of loans, (ii) establish maximum interest rates, finance charges and other charges, (iii) require disclosures to customers and investors, (iv) govern secured transactions, (v) set collection, foreclosure, repossession and other trade practices and (vi) regulate the use and reporting of information related to a borrowers credit experience. Cat Financials ability to comply with these and other governmental and legal requirements and restrictions affects its operations. Cat Financials retail leases and installment sale contracts (totaling 53 percent*) include:  ##TABLE_START  Tax leases that are classified as either operating or finance leases for financial accounting purposes, depending on the characteristics of the lease. For tax purposes, Cat Financial is considered the owner of the equipment (15 percent*). ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  Finance (non-tax) leases, where the lessee for tax purposes is considered to be the owner of the equipment during the term of the lease, that either require or allow the customer to purchase the equipment for a fixed price at the end of the term (19 percent*). ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  Installment sale contracts, which are equipment loans that enable customers to purchase equipment with a down payment or trade-in and structure payments over time (18 percent*). ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  Governmental lease-purchase plans in the U.S. that offer low interest rates and flexible terms to qualified non-federal government agencies (1 percent*). ##TABLE_END  Cat Financials wholesale notes receivable, finance leases and installment sale contracts (totaling 14 percent*) include:  ##TABLE_START  Inventory/rental programs, which provide assistance to dealers by financing their new Caterpillar inventory and rental fleets (5 percent*). ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  Short-term receivables Cat Financial purchased from Caterpillar at a discount (9 percent*). ##TABLE_END  Cat Financials retail notes receivables (33 percent*) include:  ##TABLE_START  Loans that allow customers and dealers to use their Caterpillar equipment or other assets as collateral to obtain financing. ##TABLE_END  _________________________________ *Indicates the percentage of Cat Financials total portfolio at December 31, 2013. We define total portfolio as total finance receivables (net of unearned income and allowance for credit losses) plus equipment on operating leases, less accumulated depreciation. For more information on the above and Cat Financials concentration of credit risk, please refer to Note 6  Cat Financial Financing Activities of Exhibit 13.  Cat Financial operates in a highly competitive environment, with financing for users of Caterpillar equipment available through a variety of sources, principally commercial banks and finance and leasing companies. Cat Financials competitors include Wells Fargo Equipment Finance Inc., General Electric Capital Corporation and various other banks and finance companies. In addition, many of our manufacturing competitors own financial subsidiaries such as Volvo Financial Services, Komatsu Financial L.P. and John Deere Capital Corporation that utilize below-market interest rate programs (funded by the manufacturer) to assist machine sales. Caterpillar and Cat Financial work together to provide a broad array of financial merchandising programs around the world to meet these competitive offers.  Cat Financials financial results are largely dependent upon the ability of Caterpillar dealers to sell equipment and customers willingness to enter into financing or leasing agreements. It is also affected by, among other things, the availability of funds from its financing sources, general economic conditions such as inflation and market interest rates and its cost of funds relative to its competitors.  Cat Financial has a match funding policy that addresses interest rate risk by aligning the interest rate profile (fixed rate or floating rate) of its debt portfolio with the interest rate profile of its receivables portfolio (loans and leases with customers and dealers) within predetermined ranges on an ongoing basis. In connection with that policy, Cat Financial issues debt with a similar interest rate profile to its receivables, and also uses interest rate swap agreements to manage its interest rate risk exposure to interest rate changes and in some cases to lower its cost of borrowed funds. For more information regarding match funding, please see Note 3  Derivative financial instruments and risk management of Exhibit 13. See also the risk factors on pages 9 through 19 for general risks associated with our financial products business included in Item 1A. of this Form 10-K. In managing foreign currency risk for Cat Financials operations, the objective is to minimize earnings volatility resulting from conversion and the remeasurement of net foreign currency balance sheet positions, and future transactions denominated in foreign currencies. This policy allows the use of foreign currency forward, option and cross currency contracts to offset the risk of currency mismatch between the receivable and debt portfolios, and exchange rate risk associated with future transactions denominated in foreign currencies. Substantially all such foreign currency forward, option and cross currency contracts are undesignated.  Cat Financial provides financing only when certain criteria are met. Credit decisions are based on, among other factors, the customers credit history, financial strength and intended use of equipment. Cat Financial typically maintains a security interest in retail-financed equipment and requires physical damage insurance coverage on financed equipment. Cat Financial finances a significant portion of Caterpillar dealers sales and inventory of Caterpillar equipment throughout the world. Cat Financials competitive position is improved by marketing programs offered in conjunction with Caterpillar and/or Caterpillar dealers. Under these programs, Caterpillar, or the dealer, funds an amount at the outset of the transaction, which Cat Financial then recognizes as revenue over the term of the financing. We believe that these marketing programs provide Cat Financial a significant competitive advantage in financing Caterpillar products.

Competitive Environment  Caterpillar products and product support services are sold worldwide into a variety of highly competitive markets. In all markets, we compete on the basis of product performance, customer service, quality and price. From time to time, the intensity of competition results in price discounting in a particular industry or region. Such price discounting puts pressure on margins and can negatively impact operating profit. Outside the United States, certain of our competitors enjoy competitive advantages inherent to operating in their home countries or regions.  Raw Materials and Component Products  We source our raw materials and manufactured components from suppliers both domestically and internationally. These purchases include unformed materials and rough and finished parts. Unformed materials include a variety of steel products, which are then cut or formed to shape and machined in our facilities. Rough parts include various sized steel and iron castings and forgings, which are machined to final specification levels inside our facilities. Finished parts are ready to assemble components, which are made either to Caterpillar specifications or to the supplier developed specifications. We machine and assemble some of the components used in our machines, engines and power generation units and to support our after-market dealer parts sales. We also purchase various goods and services used in production, logistics, offices and product development processes. We maintain global strategic sourcing models to meet our global facilities production needs while building long-term supplier relationships and leveraging enterprise spend. We expect our suppliers to maintain, at all times, industry-leading levels of quality and the ability to timely deliver raw materials and component products for our machine and engine products. We use a variety of agreements with suppliers to protect our intellectual property and processes to monitor and mitigate risks of the supply base causing a business disruption. The risks monitored include supplier financial viability, the ability to increase or decrease production levels, business continuity, quality and delivery.  Order Backlog  The dollar amount of backlog believed to be firm was approximately $18.0 billion, $20.2 billion and $29.8 billion at December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively. The order backlog declined significantly for mining-related products within Resource Industries and declined slightly for Power Systems. These declines were partially offset by a substantial increase in Construction Industries. In 2012, the decline occurred in Construction Industries, Resource Industries and Power Systems, with the most significant decrease in Resource Industries. Although dealer deliveries to end users were higher in 2012 compared to 2011, Cat dealers lowered their order rates well below end-user demand to reduce their inventories. Of the total backlog, approximately $3.0 billion, $4.5 billion and $4.0 billion at December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively, was not expected to be filled in the following year. Dealers and Distributors  Our machines are distributed principally through a worldwide organization of dealers (dealer network), 48 located in the United States and 130 located outside the United States, serving 182 countries and operating 3,454 places of business, including 1,202 dealer rental outlets. Reciprocating engines are sold principally through the dealer network and to other manufacturers for use in their products. Some of the reciprocating engines manufactured by our subsidiary Perkins Engines Company Limited (Perkins), are also sold through its worldwide network of 100 distributors located in 180 countries. Most of the electric power generation systems manufactured by our subsidiary Caterpillar Northern Ireland Limited, formerly known as F.G. Wilson Engineering Limited, are sold through its worldwide network of 264 distributors located in 145 countries. Some of the large, medium speed reciprocating engines are also sold under the MaK brand through a worldwide network of 19 distributors located in 130 countries.  Our dealers do not deal exclusively with our products; however, in most cases sales and servicing of our products are the dealers principal business. Turbines, locomotives and certain global mining products are sold directly to end customers through sales forces employed by the company. At times, these employees are assisted by independent sales representatives. While the large majority of our worldwide dealers are independently owned and operated, we own and operate three dealerships in Japan: Caterpillar East Japan Ltd., Caterpillar West Japan Ltd. and Caterpillar Tohoku Ltd. (Cat Tohoku) in the North. We are currently operating these Japanese dealers directly and their results are reported in the Construction Industries segment. There are also three independent dealers in the Southern Region of Japan.  For Caterpillar branded products, the companys relationship with each of its independent dealers is memorialized in a standard sales and service agreement. Pursuant to this agreement, the company grants the dealer the right to purchase and sell its products and to service the products in a specified geographic service territory. Prices to dealers are established by the company after receiving input from dealers on transactional pricing in the marketplace. The company also agrees to defend its intellectual property and to provide warranty and technical support to the dealer. The agreement further grants the dealer a non-exclusive license to use the companys trademarks, service marks and brand names. In some instances, a separate trademark agreement exists between the company and a dealer.  In exchange for these rights, the agreement obligates the dealer to develop and promote the sale of the companys products to current and prospective customers in the dealers service territory. Each dealer agrees to employ adequate sales and support personnel to market, sell and promote the companys products, demonstrate and exhibit the products, perform the companys product improvement programs, inform the company concerning any features that might affect the safe operation of any of the companys products and maintain detailed books and records of the dealers financial condition, sales and inventories and make these books and records available at the companys reasonable request.  These sales and service agreements are terminable at will by either party primarily upon 90 days written notice and provide for termination automatically if the dealer files for bankruptcy protection or upon the occurrence of comparable action seeking protection from creditors.  Patents and Trademarks  Our products are sold primarily under the brands Caterpillar, CAT, design versions of CAT and Caterpillar, Electro-Motive, FG Wilson, MaK, MWM, Perkins, Progress Rail, SEM and Solar Turbines. We own a number of patents and trademarks, which have been obtained over a period of years and relate to the products we manufacture and the services we provide. These patents and trademarks have been of value in the growth of our business and may continue to be of value in the future. We do not regard any of our business as being dependent upon any single patent or group of patents.  Research and Development  We have always placed strong emphasis on product-oriented research and development relating to the development of new or improved machines, engines and major components. In 2013, 2012 and 2011, we spent $2,046 million, $2,466 million and $2,297 million, or 3.7, 3.7, and 3.8 percent of our sales and revenues, respectively, on our research and development programs. Research and development expense is expected to increase about 7 percent in 2014.  Employment  As of December 31, 2013, we employed 118,501 persons of whom 66,624 were located outside the United States. We build and maintain a productive, motivated workforce by striving to treat all employees fairly and equitably.  In the United States, most of our 51,877 employees are at-will employees and, therefore, not subject to any type of employment contract or agreement. At select business units, certain highly specialized employees have been hired under employment contracts that specify a term of employment and specify pay and other benefits. As of December 31, 2013, there were 11,284 U.S. hourly production employees who were covered by collective bargaining agreements with various labor unions. The United Automobile, Aerospace and Agricultural Implement Workers of America (UAW) represents 7,460 Caterpillar employees under a six-year central labor agreement that expires on March 1, 2017. The International Association of Machinists (IAM) represents 1,694 employees under labor agreements that will expire on May 17, 2015 and April 30, 2018. The United Steelworkers (USW) represents 741 employees under labor agreements that will expire on April 30, 2015, August 19, 2018 and April 30, 2019.  Outside the United States, the company enters into employment contracts and agreements in those countries in which such relationships are mandatory or customary. The provisions of these agreements correspond in each case with the required or customary terms in the subject jurisdiction.  Sales and Revenues  Sales and revenues outside the United States were 67 percent of consolidated sales and revenues for 2013, 69 percent for 2012 and 70 percent for 2011.  Environmental Matters  The company is regulated by federal, state and international environmental laws governing our use, transport and disposal of substances and control of emissions. In addition to governing our manufacturing and other operations, these laws often impact the development of our products, including, but not limited to, required compliance with air emissions standards applicable to internal combustion engines. We have made, and will continue to make, significant research and development and capital expenditures to comply with these emissions standards.  We are engaged in remedial activities at a number of locations, often with other companies, pursuant to federal and state laws. When it is probable we will pay remedial costs at a site, and those costs can be reasonably estimated, the investigation, remediation, and operating and maintenance costs are accrued against our earnings. Costs are accrued based on consideration of currently available data and information with respect to each individual site, including available technologies, current applicable laws and regulations, and prior remediation experience. Where no amount within a range of estimates is more likely, we accrue the minimum. Where multiple potentially responsible parties are involved, we consider our proportionate share of the probable costs. In formulating the estimate of probable costs, we do not consider amounts expected to be recovered from insurance companies or others. We reassess these accrued amounts on a quarterly basis. The amount recorded for environmental remediation is not material and is included in the line item \"Accrued expenses\" in Statement 3 -- \"Consolidated Financial Position at December 31\" of Exhibit 13. There is no more than a remote chance that a material amount for remedial activities at any individual site, or at all the sites in the aggregate, will be required.

Although we believe we have been prudent in our assumptions, any or all of our forward-looking statements may prove to be inaccurate, and we can make no guarantees about our future performance. Should known or unknown risks or uncertainties materialize or underlying assumptions prove inaccurate, actual results could materially differ from past results and/or those anticipated, estimated or projected. We undertake no obligation to publicly update forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. You should, however, consult any subsequent disclosures we make in our filings with the SEC on Form 10-Q or Form 8-K.  The following is a cautionary discussion of risks, uncertainties and assumptions that we believe are significant to our business. In addition to the factors discussed elsewhere in this report, the following are some of the important factors that, individually or in the aggregate, we believe could make our actual results differ materially from those described in any forward-looking statements. It is impossible to predict or identify all such factors and, as a result, you should not consider the following factors to be a complete discussion of risks, uncertainties and assumptions.  Our business is highly sensitive to global economic conditions and economic conditions in the industries we serve.  Our results of operations are materially affected by economic conditions globally and in the particular industries we serve. The demand for our products and services tends to be cyclical and can be significantly reduced in an economic environment characterized by higher unemployment, lower consumer spending, lower corporate earnings and lower levels of government and business investment. A prolonged period of slow growth may also reduce demand for our products and services. Economic conditions vary across regions and countries, and demand for our products generally increases in those regions and countries experiencing economic growth and investment. A change in the global mix of regions and countries experiencing economic growth and investment could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.  The energy and mining industries are major users of our products, including the coal, iron ore, gold, copper, oil and natural gas industries. Decisions to purchase our products are dependent upon the performance of these industries, which in turn are dependent in part on commodity prices. Increases in demand or output in these industries may lead to increases in demand for our products. Conversely, if demand or output in these industries declines, the demand for our products will generally decrease. Prices of commodities in these industries are frequently volatile and change in response to general economic conditions, economic growth, government actions, regulatory actions, commodity inventories and any disruptions in production or distribution. We assume certain prices for key commodities in preparing our general economic and financial outlooks (outlooks). Commodity prices lower than those assumed in our outlooks may negatively impact our business, results of operations and financial condition. Economic conditions affecting the industries we serve may in the future also lead to reduced capital expenditures by our customers. Reduced capital expenditures by our customers are likely to lead to a decrease in the demand for our products.  The rates of infrastructure spending, housing starts and commercial construction also play a significant role in our results. Our products are an integral component of these activities, and as these activities decrease inside or outside of the United States, demand for our products may be significantly impacted, which could negatively impact our results. Slower rates of economic growth than anticipated in our outlooks could also adversely impact our business, results of operations and financial condition.  Changes in government monetary or fiscal policies may negatively impact our results .  Most countries have established central banks to regulate monetary systems and influence economic activities, generally by adjusting interest rates. Interest rate changes affect overall economic growth, which affects demand for residential and nonresidential structures, as well as energy and mined products, which in turn affects sales of our products that serve these activities. Interest rate changes also affect our customers ability to finance machine purchases, can change the optimal time to keep machines in a fleet and can impact the ability of our suppliers to finance the production of parts and components necessary to manufacture and support our products. Our outlooks typically include assumptions about interest rates in a number of countries. Interest rates higher than those contained in our assumptions could result in lower sales than anticipated and supply chain inefficiencies.  Central banks and other policy arms of many countries take actions to vary the amount of liquidity and credit available in an economy. Liquidity and credit policies different from those assumed in our outlooks could impact the customers and markets we serve or our suppliers, which could adversely impact our business, results of operations and financial condition. Changes in monetary and fiscal policies, along with other factors, may cause currency exchange rates to fluctuate. Actions that lead the currency exchange rate of a country where we manufacture products to increase relative to other currencies could reduce the competitiveness of products made in that country, which could adversely affect our competitive position, results of operations and financial condition. Government policies on taxes and spending also affect our business. Throughout the world, government spending finances a significant portion of infrastructure development, such as highways, airports, sewer and water systems and dams. Tax regulations determine depreciation lives and the amount of money users of our products can retain, both of which influence investment decisions. Unfavorable developments, such as declines in government revenues, decisions to reduce public spending or increases in taxes, could negatively impact our results.  Commodity price changes, component price increases, fluctuations in demand for our products or significant shortages of component products may adversely impact our financial results or our ability to meet commitments to customers.  We are a significant user of steel and many other commodities required for the manufacture of our products. Unanticipated increases in the prices of such commodities would increase our costs, negatively impacting our business, results of operations and financial condition if we are unable to fully offset the effect of these increased costs through price increases, productivity improvements or cost reduction programs.  We rely on suppliers to secure component products, particularly steel, required for the manufacture of our products. A disruption in deliveries to or from suppliers or decreased availability of components or commodities could have an adverse effect on our ability to meet our commitments to customers or increase our operating costs. On the other hand, if demand for our products is less than we expect, we may experience excess inventories and be forced to incur additional charges and our profitability may suffer. Our business, competitive position, results of operations or financial condition could be negatively impacted if supply is insufficient for our operations. Our financial condition and results of operations may be negatively impacted if we experience excess inventories or we are unable to adjust our production schedules or our purchases from suppliers to reflect changes in customer demand and market fluctuations on a timely basis.  Disruptions or volatility in global financial markets could limit our sources of liquidity, or the liquidity of our customers, dealers and suppliers.  Global economic conditions may cause volatility and disruptions in the capital and credit markets. Although we have generated funds from our operations to pay our operating expenses, fund our capital expenditures and support growth, fund our employee retirement benefit programs, pay dividends and buy back stock, continuing to meet these cash requirements over the long-term requires substantial liquidity and access to varied sources of funds, including capital and credit markets. Changes in global economic conditions, including material cost increases and decreases in economic activity in the markets that we serve, and the success of plans to manage cost increases, inventory and other important elements of our business may significantly impact our ability to generate funds from operations. Market volatility, changes in counterparty credit risk, the impact of government intervention in financial markets and general economic conditions may also adversely impact our ability to access capital and credit markets to fund operating needs. Global or regional economic downturns could cause financial markets to decrease the availability of liquidity, credit and credit capacity for certain issuers, including certain of our customers, dealers and suppliers. An inability to access capital and credit markets may have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and competitive position.  In addition, demand for our products generally depends on customers ability to pay for our products, which, in turn, depends on their access to funds. Subject to global economic conditions, customers may experience increased difficulty in generating funds from operations. Capital and credit market volatility and uncertainty may cause financial institutions to revise their lending standards, thereby decreasing access to capital. If capital and credit market volatility occurs, customers liquidity may decline which, in turn, would reduce their ability to purchase our products. Our global operations are exposed to political and economic risks, commercial instability and events beyond our control in the countries in which we operate.  Our global operations are dependent upon products manufactured, purchased and sold in the U.S. and internationally, including in countries with political and economic instability. In some cases, these countries have greater political and economic volatility and greater vulnerability to infrastructure and labor disruptions than in our other markets. Our business could be negatively impacted by adverse fluctuations in freight costs, limitations on shipping and receiving capacity, and other disruptions in the transportation and shipping infrastructure at important geographic points of exit and entry for our products. Operating and seeking to expand business in a number of different regions and countries exposes us to a number of risks, including:  ##TABLE_START  multiple and potentially conflicting laws, regulations and policies that are subject to change; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  imposition of currency restrictions, restrictions on repatriation of earnings or other restraints; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  imposition of burdensome tariffs or quotas; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  national and international conflict, including terrorist acts; and ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  political and economic instability or civil unrest that may severely disrupt economic activity in affected countries. ##TABLE_END  The occurrence of one or more of these events may negatively impact our business, results of operations and financial condition.  Failure to maintain our credit ratings would increase our cost of borrowing and could adversely affect our cost of funds, liquidity, competitive position and access to capital markets.  Each of Caterpillars and Cat Financials costs of borrowing and ability to access the capital markets are affected not only by market conditions but also by the short- and long-term debt ratings assigned to their respective debt by the major credit rating agencies. These ratings are based, in significant part, on each of Caterpillars and Cat Financials performance as measured by financial metrics such as net worth and interest coverage and leverage ratios, as well as transparency with rating agencies and timeliness of financial reporting. There can be no assurance that Caterpillar or Cat Financial will be able to maintain their credit ratings and the failure of either Caterpillar or Cat Financial to do so could adversely affect our cost of funds, liquidity, competitive position and access to the capital markets, including restricting, in whole or in part, our access to the commercial paper market. There can be no assurance that the commercial paper market will continue to be a reliable source of short-term financing for Cat Financial or an available source of short-term financing for Caterpillar. An inability to access the capital markets could have an adverse effect on our cash flow, results of operations and financial condition.  Our Financial Products segment is subject to risks associated with the financial services industry.  Cat Financial is significant to our operations and provides financing support to a significant share of our global sales. The inability of Cat Financial to access funds to support its financing activities to our customers could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Continuing to meet Cat Financial's cash requirements over the long-term could require substantial liquidity and access to sources of funds, including capital and credit markets. Cat Financial has continued to maintain access to key global medium term note and commercial paper markets, but there can be no assurance that such markets will continue to represent a reliable source of financing. If global economic conditions were to deteriorate, Cat Financial could face materially higher financing costs, become unable to access adequate funding to operate and grow its business and/or meet its debt service obligations as they mature, and be required to draw upon contractually committed lending agreements and/or by seeking other funding sources. However, under extreme market conditions, there can be no assurance that such agreements and other funding sources would be available or sufficient. Any of these events could negatively impact Cat Financials business, as well as our and Cat Financial's results of operations and financial condition.  Market disruption and volatility may also lead to a number of other risks in connection with these events, including but not limited to:  ##TABLE_START  Market developments that may affect customer confidence levels and cause declines in the demand for financing and adverse changes in payment patterns, causing increases in delinquencies and default rates, which could impact Cat Financials write-offs and provision for credit losses. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  The process Cat Financial uses to estimate losses inherent in its credit exposure requires a high degree of managements judgment regarding numerous subjective qualitative factors, including forecasts of economic conditions and how economic predictors might impair the ability of its borrowers to repay their loans. Financial market disruption and volatility may impact the accuracy of these judgments. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  Cat Financials ability to engage in routine funding transactions or borrow from other financial institutions on acceptable terms or at all could be adversely affected by disruptions in the capital markets or other events, including actions by rating agencies and deteriorating investor expectations. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  As Cat Financials counterparties are primarily financial institutions, their ability to perform in accordance with any of its underlying agreements could be adversely affected by market volatility and/or disruptions in financial markets. ##TABLE_END Changes in interest rates or market liquidity conditions could adversely affect Cat Financial's and our earnings and/or cash flow.  Changes in interest rates and market liquidity conditions could have an adverse effect on Cat Financial's and our earnings and cash flows. Because a significant number of the loans made by Cat Financial are made at fixed interest rates, its business is subject to fluctuations in interest rates. Changes in market interest rates may influence its financing costs, returns on financial investments and the valuation of derivative contracts and could reduce its and our earnings and cash flows. Although Cat Financial manages interest rate and market liquidity risks through a variety of techniques, including a match funding program, the selective use of derivatives and a broadly diversified funding program, there can be no assurance that fluctuations in interest rates and market liquidity conditions will not have an adverse effect on its and our earnings and cash flows. If any of the variety of instruments and strategies Cat Financial uses to hedge its exposure to these types of risk is ineffective, we may incur losses. With respect to Insurance Services' investment activities, changes in the equity and bond markets could cause an impairment of the value of its investment portfolio, requiring a negative adjustment to earnings. An increase in delinquencies, repossessions or net losses of Cat Financial customers could adversely affect its results.  Inherent in the operation of Cat Financial is the credit risk associated with its customers. The creditworthiness of each customer and the rate of delinquencies, repossessions and net losses on customer obligations are directly impacted by several factors, including relevant industry and economic conditions, the availability of capital, the experience and expertise of the customer's management team, commodity prices, political events and the sustained value of the underlying collateral. Any increase in delinquencies, repossessions and net losses on customer obligations could have a material adverse effect on Cat Financial's and our earnings and cash flows. In addition, although Cat Financial evaluates and adjusts its allowance for credit losses related to past due and non-performing receivables on a regular basis, adverse economic conditions or other factors that might cause deterioration of the financial health of its customers could change the timing and level of payments received and thus necessitate an increase in Cat Financial's estimated losses, which could also have a material adverse effect on Cat Financial's and our earnings and cash flows.  New regulations or changes in financial services regulation could adversely impact Caterpillar and Cat Financial.  Cat Financials operations are highly regulated by governmental authorities in the locations where it operates, which can impose significant additional costs and/or restrictions on its business. In the U.S., for example, Cat Financials operations are subject to the U.S. Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Dodd-Frank). Dodd-Frank was signed into law in July 2010 and includes extensive provisions regulating the financial services industry. Many of the regulations implementing the derivatives provisions of Dodd-Frank became effective in 2013 and additional requirements will become effective in 2014. As such, Cat Financial has become and could continue to become subject to additional regulatory costs both directly and indirectly, through increased costs of doing business with more marketing intermediaries that are now subject to extensive regulation pursuant to Dodd-Frank. For example, derivatives dealers may seek to pass to us the cost of any margin, capital or other regulatory requirements that they are subject to under Dodd-Frank. As the regulatory regime is still developing and important additional regulations have yet to be adopted, the ultimate costs of Dodd-Frank on Cat Financials business remain uncertain. However, such costs could be significant  and have an adverse effect on Cat Financial's and our results of operations and financial condition. Additional regulations in the U.S. or internationally impacting the financial services industry could also add significant cost or operational constraints that might have an adverse effect on Cat Financial's and our results of operations and financial condition. We may not realize all of the anticipated benefits of our acquisitions, joint ventures or divestitures, or these benefits may take longer to realize than expected. In pursuing our business strategy, we routinely evaluate targets and enter into agreements regarding possible acquisitions, divestitures and joint ventures. We often compete with others for the same opportunities. To be successful, we conduct due diligence to identify valuation issues and potential loss contingencies, negotiate transaction terms, complete complex transactions and manage post-closing matters such as the integration of acquired businesses. Our due diligence reviews are subject to the completeness and accuracy of disclosures made by third parties. We may incur unanticipated costs or expenses following a completed acquisition, including post-closing asset impairment charges, expenses associated with eliminating duplicate facilities, litigation, and other liabilities. The risks associated with our past or future acquisitions also include the following:  ##TABLE_START  the business culture of the acquired business may not match well with our culture; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  technological and product synergies, economies of scale and cost reductions may not occur as expected; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  unforeseen expenses, delays or conditions may be imposed upon the acquisition, including due to required regulatory approvals or consents; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  we may acquire or assume unexpected liabilities or be subject to unexpected penalties or other enforcement actions; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  faulty assumptions may be made regarding the integration process; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  unforeseen difficulties may arise in integrating operations, processes and systems; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  higher than expected investments may be required to implement necessary compliance processes and related systems, including IT systems, accounting systems and internal controls over financial reporting; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  we may fail to retain, motivate and integrate key management and other employees of the acquired business; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  higher than expected costs may arise due to unforeseen changes in tax, trade, environmental, labor, safety, payroll or pension policies in any jurisdiction in which the acquired business conducts its operations; and ##TABLE_END 13 ##TABLE_START  we may experience problems in retaining customers and integrating customer bases. ##TABLE_END Many of these factors will be outside of our control and any one of them could result in increased costs, decreases in the amount of expected revenues and diversion of managements time and attention. They may also delay the realization of the benefits we anticipate when we enter into a transaction.  In order to conserve cash for operations, we may undertake acquisitions financed in part through public offerings or private placements of debt or equity securities, or other arrangements. Such acquisition financing could result in a decrease of our ratio of earnings to fixed charges and adversely affect other leverage measures. If we issue equity securities or equity-linked securities, the issued securities may have a dilutive effect on the interests of the holders of our common shares.  Failure to implement our acquisition strategy, including successfully integrating acquired businesses, could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Furthermore, we make strategic divestitures from time to time, including the ongoing divestiture of the Bucyrus distribution business to our independent dealers. In the case of divestitures, we may agree to indemnify acquiring parties for certain liabilities arising from our former businesses. These divestitures may also result in continued financial involvement in the divested businesses, including through guarantees or other financial arrangements, following the transaction. Lower performance by those divested businesses could affect our future financial results.  International trade policies may impact demand for our products and our competitive position.  Government policies on international trade and investment such as import quotas, capital controls or tariffs, whether adopted by individual governments or addressed by regional trade blocs, can affect the demand for our products and services, impact the competitive position of our products or prevent us from being able to sell products in certain countries. The implementation of more restrictive trade policies, such as more detailed inspections, higher tariffs or new barriers to entry, in countries where we sell large quantities of products and services could negatively impact our business, results of operations and financial condition. For example, a governments adoption of buy national policies or retaliation by another government against such policies could have a negative impact on our results of operations.  The success of our business depends on our ability to develop, produce and market quality products that meet our customers needs.  Our business relies on continued global demand for our brands and products. To achieve business goals, we must develop and sell products that appeal to our dealers, OEMs and customers. This is dependent on a number of factors, including our ability to maintain key dealer relationships, our ability to produce products that meet the quality, performance and price expectations of our customers and our ability to develop effective sales, advertising and marketing programs. In addition, our continued success in selling products that appeal to our customers is dependent on leading-edge innovation, with respect to both products and operations, and on the availability and effectiveness of legal protection for our innovation. Failure to continue to deliver high quality, innovative, competitive products to the marketplace, to adequately protect our intellectual property rights, to supply products that meet applicable regulatory requirements, including EPA Tier 4 Interim and Tier 4 Final diesel engine emission requirements and equivalent standards in the EU, Israel, Japan and Canada (Tier 4), or to predict market demands for, or gain market acceptance of, our products, could have a negative impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition. We operate in a highly competitive environment, which could adversely affect our sales and pricing.  We operate in a highly competitive environment, and our outlook depends on a forecast of our share of industry sales based on our ability to compete with others in the marketplace. We compete on the basis of product performance, customer service, quality and price. There can be no assurance that our products will be able to compete successfully with other companies products. Thus, our share of industry sales could be reduced due to aggressive pricing or product strategies pursued by competitors, unanticipated product or manufacturing difficulties, our failure to price our products competitively, our failure to produce our products at a competitive cost or an unexpected buildup in competitors new machine or dealer-owned rental fleets, leading to severe downward pressure on machine rental rates and/or used equipment prices.  Our sales outlook assumes that certain price increases we announce from time to time will be realized in the marketplace. Changes in market acceptance of price increases, changes in market requirements for price discounts, changes in our competitors behavior or a weak pricing environment attributable to industry overcapacity could have an adverse impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition.  In addition, our results and ability to compete may be impacted negatively by changes in our sales mix. Our outlook assumes a certain geographic mix of sales as well as a certain product mix of sales. If actual results vary from this projected geographic and product mix of sales, our results could be negatively impacted.  We may not realize all of the anticipated benefits from cost-reduction initiatives, cash flow improvement initiatives and efficiency or productivity initiatives. We are actively engaged in a number of initiatives to increase our productivity, efficiency and cash flow and to reduce costs, which we expect to have a positive effect on our business, competitive position, results of operations and financial condition. For example, we formed the Caterpillar Enterprise System Group in 2013 to implement sustained improvements in our operational efficiency and order-to-delivery processes so that our lead time is better aligned with customer requirements, as well as to reduce waste, further enhance quality and maximize value for our customers. We are also in the process of implementing a new operating system in many of our businesses to increase efficiency and harmonize our operations. There can be no assurance that this operating system, these initiatives, or others will continue to be beneficial to the extent anticipated, or that the estimated efficiency improvements, incremental cost savings or cash flow improvements will be realized as anticipated or at all. If our new operating system is not implemented successfully, it could have an adverse effect on our operations and competitive position. We could incur additional restructuring charges as we continue to contemplate cost reduction actions in an effort to optimize our cost structure and may not achieve the anticipated savings and benefits of these actions. In December 2013, we announced a restructuring plan for our Gosselies, Belgium operations in order to improve the competitiveness of our European manufacturing footprint. We expect to incur significant separation-related charges in connection with this restructuring plan throughout 2014, which will reduce our profitability in the periods incurred. In addition, we expect to take additional restructuring actions in 2014 to optimize our cost structure and improve the efficiency of our operation. As a result of these actions, we may incur additional charges, including but not limited to asset impairments, employee termination costs, charges for pension and other postretirement contractual benefits, potential additional pension funding obligations, and pension curtailments, any of which could be significant, and could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. In addition, we may not realize anticipated savings or benefits from past or future cost reduction actions in full or in part or within the time periods we expect. We are also subject to the risks of labor unrest, negative publicity and business disruption in connection with our cost reduction actions. Failure to realize anticipated savings or benefits from our cost reduction actions could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition, liquidity, results of operations and cash flows. Our business is subject to the inventory management decisions and sourcing practices of our dealers and our OEM customers.  We sell finished products through an independent dealer network and directly to OEMs and are subject to risks relating to their inventory management decisions and operational and sourcing practices. Both carry inventories of finished products as part of ongoing operations and adjust those inventories based on their assessments of future needs. Such adjustments may impact our results positively or negatively. If the inventory levels of our dealers and OEM customers are higher than they desire, they may postpone product purchases from us, which could cause our sales to be lower than the end-user demand for our products and negatively impact our results. Similarly, our results could be negatively impacted through the loss of time-sensitive sales if our dealers and OEM customers do not maintain inventory levels sufficient to meet customer demand. Additionally, some of our engine customers are OEMs that manufacture or could in the future manufacture engines for their own products. Despite their engine manufacturing abilities, these customers have chosen to outsource certain types of engine production to us due to the quality of our engine products and in order to reduce costs, eliminate production risks and maintain company focus. However, there can be no assurance that these customers will continue to outsource engine manufacture in the future. Decreased levels of production outsourcing by these customers could result from a number of factors, such as shifts in our customers business strategies, acquisition by a customer of another engine manufacturer, the inability of third-party suppliers to meet specifications and the emergence of low-cost production opportunities in foreign countries. A significant reduction in the level of engine production outsourcing from our OEM customers could significantly impact our revenues and, accordingly, have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. We are subject to stringent environmental laws and regulations that impose significant compliance costs.  Our facilities, operations and products are subject to increasingly stringent environmental laws and regulations, including laws and regulations governing emissions to air, discharges to water and the generation, handling, storage, transportation, treatment and disposal of non-hazardous and hazardous waste materials. Some environmental laws impose strict, retroactive and joint and several liability for the remediation of the release of hazardous substances, even for conduct that was lawful at the time it occurred, or for the conduct of, or conditions caused by, prior operators, predecessors or other third parties. Failure to comply with environmental laws could expose us to penalties or clean-up costs, civil or criminal liability and sanctions on certain of our activities, as well as damage to property or natural resources. These liabilities, sanctions, damages and remediation efforts related to any non-compliance with such laws and regulations could negatively impact our ability to conduct our operations and our financial condition and results of operations. In addition, there can be no assurances that we will not be adversely affected by costs, liabilities or claims with respect to existing or subsequently acquired operations or under present laws and regulations or those that may be adopted or imposed in the future.  Our engines are subject to extensive statutory and regulatory requirements governing exhaust emissions and noise, including standards imposed by the EPA, state regulatory agencies in the United States and other regulatory agencies around the world. For instance, national, state or local governments may set new emissions standards that could impact our products and operations in ways that are difficult to anticipate with accuracy. Thus, significant changes in standards, or the adoption of new standards, have the potential to negatively impact our business, results of operations, financial condition and competitive position.  Our global operations are subject to extensive trade and anti-corruption laws and regulations.  Due to the international scope of our operations, we are subject to a complex system of import- and export-related laws and regulations, including U.S. regulations issued by Customs and Border Protection, the Bureau of Industry and Security, the Office of Antiboycott Compliance, the Directorate of Defense Trade Controls and the Office of Foreign Assets Control, as well as the counterparts of these agencies in other countries. Any alleged or actual violations may subject us to government scrutiny, investigation and civil and criminal penalties, and may limit our ability to import or export our products or to provide services outside the United States. Furthermore, embargoes and sanctions imposed by the U.S. and other governments prohibiting sales to specific persons or countries or based on product classification expose us to criminal and civil sanctions. We cannot predict the nature, scope or effect of future regulatory requirements to which our operations might be subject or the manner in which existing laws might be administered or interpreted.  In addition, the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and similar foreign anti-corruption laws generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments or providing anything of value to improperly influence foreign government officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business, or obtaining an unfair advantage. Recent years have seen a substantial increase in the global enforcement of anti-corruption laws. Our continued operation and expansion outside the United States, including in developing countries, could increase the risk of such violations. In addition, we enter into joint ventures with joint venture partners who are domiciled in areas of the world with laws, regulations and business practices that differ from those in the United States. There is risk that our joint venture partners will violate applicable laws and regulations. Violations of anti-corruption laws or regulations by our employees, by intermediaries acting on our behalf, or by our joint venture partners may result in severe criminal or civil sanctions, could disrupt our business, and result in an adverse effect on our reputation, business and results of operations or financial condition. We may incur additional tax expense or become subject to additional tax exposure.  We are subject to income taxes in the United States and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Our domestic and international tax liabilities are dependent upon the location of earnings among these different jurisdictions. Our provision for income taxes and cash tax liability in the future could be adversely affected by numerous factors, including income before taxes being lower than anticipated in countries with lower statutory tax rates and higher than anticipated in countries with higher statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, as well as, changes in tax laws and regulations. We are also subject to the continuous examination of our income tax returns by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities. The results of audit and examination of previously filed tax returns and continuing assessments of our tax exposures may have an adverse effect on the companys provision for income taxes and cash tax liability. Currency exchange rate fluctuations affect our results of operations, as reported in our financial statements.  We conduct operations in many areas of the world, involving transactions denominated in a variety of currencies. We are subject to currency exchange rate risk to the extent that our costs are denominated in currencies other than those in which we earn revenues. In addition, because our financial statements are reported in U.S. dollars, changes in currency exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and other currencies have had, and will continue to have, an impact on our results of operations. While we customarily enter into financial transactions to address these risks, there can be no assurance that currency exchange rate fluctuations will not adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. While the use of currency hedging instruments may provide us with protection from adverse fluctuations in currency exchange rates, by utilizing these instruments we potentially forego the benefits that might result from favorable fluctuations in currency exchange rates. In addition, our outlooks do not assume fluctuations in currency exchange rates. Adverse fluctuations in currency exchange rates from the date of our outlooks could cause our actual results to differ materially from those anticipated in our outlooks and adversely impact our business, results of operations and financial condition.  We also face risks arising from the imposition of exchange controls and currency devaluations. Exchange controls may limit our ability to convert foreign currencies into U.S. dollars or to remit dividends and other payments by our foreign subsidiaries or businesses located in or conducted within a country imposing controls. Currency devaluations result in a diminished value of funds denominated in the currency of the country instituting the devaluation.  Restrictive covenants in our debt agreements could limit our financial and operating flexibility.  We maintain a number of credit facilities to support general corporate purposes (facilities) and have issued debt securities to manage liquidity and fund operations (debt securities). The agreements relating to a number of the facilities and the debt securities contain certain restrictive covenants applicable to us and certain of our subsidiaries, including Cat Financial. These covenants include maintaining a consolidated net worth (defined as the consolidated stockholders equity including preferred stock but excluding the pension and other post-retirement benefits balance within accumulated other comprehensive income (loss)) of not less than $9 billion, limitations on the incurrence of liens and certain restrictions on consolidation and merger. Cat Financial has also agreed under certain of these agreements to maintain a leverage ratio (consolidated debt to consolidated net worth, calculated (1) on a monthly basis as the average of the leverage ratios determined on the last day of each of the six preceding calendar months and (2) at each December 31) not greater than 10.0 to 1, to maintain a minimum interest coverage ratio (profit excluding income taxes, interest expense and net gain/(loss) from interest rate derivatives to interest expense, calculated at the end of each calendar quarter for the rolling four quarter period then most recently ended) of not less than 1.15 to 1 and not to terminate, amend or modify its support agreement with us.  A breach of one or more of the covenants could result in adverse consequences that could negatively impact our business, results of operations and financial condition. These consequences may include the acceleration of amounts outstanding under certain of the facilities, triggering of an obligation to redeem certain debt securities, termination of existing unused commitments by our lenders, refusal by our lenders to extend further credit under one or more of the facilities or to enter into new facilities or the lowering or modification of our credit ratings or those of one or more of our subsidiaries.  Sustained increases in funding obligations under our pension plans may reduce our profitability.  We maintain certain defined benefit pension plans for our employees, which impose on us certain funding obligations. In determining our future payment obligations under the plans, we assume certain rates of return on the plan assets and growth rates of certain costs. Significant adverse changes in credit or capital markets could result in actual rates of return being materially lower than projected and increased pension expense in future years. We may be required to make contributions to our pension plans in the future, and these contributions could be material. Our cost growth rates may also be materially higher than projected. These factors could significantly increase our payment obligations under the plans, and as a result, adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.  Union disputes or other labor matters could adversely affect our operations and financial results .  Some of our employees are represented by labor unions in a number of countries under various collective bargaining agreements with varying durations and expiration dates. There can be no assurance that any current or future issues with our employees will be resolved or that we will not encounter future strikes, work stoppages or other types of conflicts with labor unions or our employees. We may not be able to satisfactorily renegotiate collective bargaining agreements in the United States and other countries when they expire. If we fail to renegotiate our existing collective bargaining agreements, we could encounter strikes or work stoppages or other types of conflicts with labor unions. In addition, existing collective bargaining agreements may not prevent a strike or work stoppage at our facilities in the future. We may also be subject to general country strikes or work stoppages unrelated to our business or collective bargaining agreements. A work stoppage or other limitations on production at our facilities for any reason could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. In addition, many of our customers and suppliers have unionized work forces. Strikes or work stoppages experienced by our customers or suppliers could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.  Costs associated with lawsuits or investigations or increases in the reserves we establish based on our assessment of contingencies may have an adverse effect on our results of operations.  We face an inherent business risk of exposure to various types of claims and lawsuits. We are involved in various intellectual property, product liability, product warranty and environmental claims and lawsuits and other legal proceedings that arise in and outside of the ordinary course of our business. The industries in which we operate are also periodically reviewed or investigated by regulators, which could lead to enforcement actions, fines and penalties or the assertion of private litigation claims. It is not possible to predict with certainty the outcome of claims, investigations and lawsuits, and we could in the future incur judgments, fines or penalties or enter into settlements of lawsuits and claims that could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition in any particular period. In addition, while we maintain insurance coverage with respect to certain claims, we may not be able to obtain such insurance on acceptable terms in the future, if at all, and any such insurance may not provide adequate coverage against any such claims.  As required by U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), we establish reserves based on our assessment of contingencies, including contingencies related to legal claims asserted against us. Subsequent developments in legal proceedings may affect our assessment and estimates of the loss contingency recorded as a reserve and require us to make payments in excess of our reserves, which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations.  Additional carbon emissions constraints may impact our capital expenditures, results of operations and competitive position.  The potential for government-mandated reductions of carbon emissions from our facilities and products is increasing. Mandatory legislative, regulatory and/or policy-based constraints are being implemented or considered by many jurisdictions. For example, the EPA has promulgated regulations governing carbon emissions from automobiles and heavy-duty on-highway diesel vehicles, which may lead to regulation of other mobile sources. Although various attempts to pass comprehensive legislation reducing carbon emissions have been unsuccessful in the United States, the EPA has also proceeded with regulating carbon emissions from stationary sources under existing law. The final details and scope of these various legislative, regulatory and policy measures around the world are unclear and their potential impact is still uncertain, so we cannot fully predict the impact on us. However, should legislation or regulations be adopted imposing significant operational restrictions and compliance requirements upon us or our products, they could negatively impact our capital expenditures, results of operations and competitive position.  Changes in accounting guidance could have an adverse effect on our results of operations, as reported in our financial statements.  Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with GAAP, which is periodically revised and/or expanded. Accordingly, from time to time we are required to adopt new or revised accounting guidance and related interpretations issued by recognized authoritative bodies, including the Financial Accounting Standards Board and the SEC. Market conditions have prompted these organizations to issue new guidance that further interprets or seeks to revise accounting pronouncements related to various transactions as well as to issue new guidance expanding disclosures. The impact of accounting pronouncements that have been issued but not yet implemented is disclosed in this annual report on Form 10-K and our quarterly reports on Form 10-Q. An assessment of proposed standards is not provided, as such proposals are subject to change through the exposure process and, therefore, their effects on our financial statements cannot be meaningfully assessed. It is possible that future accounting guidance we are required to adopt could change the current accounting treatment that we apply to our consolidated financial statements and that such changes could have an adverse effect on our results of operations, as reported in our consolidated financial statements.  Increased information technology security threats and more sophisticated computer crime pose a risk to our systems, networks, products and services.  We rely upon information technology systems and networks in connection with a variety of business activities, some of which are managed by third parties. Additionally, we collect and store data that is sensitive to Caterpillar. The secure operation of these information technology systems and networks, and the processing and maintenance of this data is critical to our business operations and strategy. Information technology security threats -- from user error to attacks designed to gain unauthorized access to our systems, networks and data -- are increasing in frequency and sophistication. Attacks may range from random attempts to coordinated and targeted attacks, including sophisticated computer crime and advanced persistent threats. These threats pose a risk to the security of our systems and networks and the confidentiality, availability and integrity of our data. We have identified attempts to gain unauthorized access to our information technology systems and networks. To our knowledge, no such attack was ultimately successful in exporting materially sensitive data or controlling materially sensitive systems or networks. Should such an attack succeed it could expose us and our customers, dealers and suppliers to misuse of information or systems, the compromising of confidential information, manipulation and destruction of data, defective products, production downtimes and operations disruptions. The occurrence of any of these events could adversely affect our reputation, competitive position, business and results of operations. In addition, such breaches in security could result in litigation, regulatory action and potential liability and the costs and operational consequences of implementing further data protection measures.  Unexpected events, including natural disasters, may increase our cost of doing business or disrupt our operations.  The occurrence of one or more unexpected events, including fires, tornadoes, tsunamis, hurricanes, earthquakes, floods and other forms of severe weather in the United States or in other countries in which we operate or in which our suppliers are located could adversely affect our operations and financial performance. Natural disasters, pandemic illness, equipment failures, power outages or other unexpected events could result in physical damage to and complete or partial closure of one or more of our manufacturing facilities or distribution centers, temporary or long-term disruption in the supply of component products from some local and international suppliers, disruption in the transport of our products to dealers and end-users and delay in the delivery of our products to our distribution centers. Existing insurance arrangements may not provide protection for all of the costs that may arise from such events. ##TABLE_START ", "1B": " Item 1B.

Legal Proceedings. ##TABLE_END  On October 24, 2013, Progress Rail Services Corporation (Progress Rail), a wholly-owned indirect subsidiary of Caterpillar Inc., received a grand jury subpoena from the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California. The subpoena requests documents and information from Progress Rail, United Industries Corporation, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Progress Rail, and Caterpillar Inc. relating to allegations that Progress Rail conducted improper or unnecessary railcar inspections and repairs and improperly disposed of parts, equipment, tools and other items. In connection with this subpoena, Progress Rail was informed by the U.S. Attorney for the Central District of California that it is a target of a criminal investigation into potential violations of environmental laws and alleged improper business practices. The Company is cooperating with the authorities. The Company is unable to predict the outcome or reasonably estimate the potential loss; however, we currently believe that this matter will not have a material adverse effect on the Company's consolidated results of operation, financial position or liquidity. In addition, we are involved in other unresolved legal actions that arise in the normal course of business. The most prevalent of these unresolved actions involve disputes related to product design, manufacture and performance liability (including claimed asbestos and welding fumes exposure), contracts, employment issues, environmental matters or intellectual property rights. The aggregate range of reasonably possible losses in excess of accrued liabilities, if any, associated with these unresolved legal actions is not material. In some cases, we cannot reasonably estimate a range of loss because there is insufficient information regarding the matter. However, there is no more than a remote chance that any liability arising from these matters would be material. Although it is not possible to predict with certainty the outcome of these unresolved legal actions, we believe that these actions will not individually or in the aggregate have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations, financial position or liquidity.  ##TABLE_START ", "4": " Item 4.

Based on that evaluation, the company's management, including the CEO and CFO concluded that the company's disclosure controls and procedures are effective as of the end of the period covered by this annual report.  Managements Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting The management of Caterpillar Inc. (company) is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act. Our internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of our financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Our internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.  Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.  Management assessed the effectiveness of the companys internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2013 . In making this assessment, we used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework (1992) . Based on our assessment we concluded that, as of December 31, 2013 , the companys internal control over financial reporting was effective based on those criteria.  The effectiveness of the companys internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2013 has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm. Their report appears on page A-4 of Exhibit 13. Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting  During the last fiscal quarter, there has been no significant change in the companys internal control over financial reporting that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the companys internal control over financial reporting. ##TABLE_START ", "9B": " Item 9B.

Business. ##TABLE_END  General  Originally organized as Caterpillar Tractor Co. in 1925 in the State of California, our company was reorganized as Caterpillar Inc. in 1986 in the State of Delaware. As used herein, the term Caterpillar, we, us, our, or the company refers to Caterpillar Inc. and its subsidiaries unless designated or identified otherwise.  Overview  With 2014 sales and revenues of $55.184 billion, Caterpillar is the worlds leading manufacturer of construction and mining equipment, diesel and natural gas engines, industrial gas turbines and diesel-electric locomotives. The company principally operates through its three product segments - Resource Industries, Construction Industries, and Energy  Transportation (formerly Power Systems) - and also provides financing and related services through its Financial Products segment. Caterpillar is also a leading U.S. exporter. Through a global network of independent dealers and direct sales of certain products, Caterpillar builds long-term relationships with customers around the world.  Currently, we have seven operating segments, of which four are reportable segments and are described below. Further information about our reportable segments, including geographic information, appears in Note 23  Segment information of Exhibit 13.  Categories of Business Organization  1.   Machinery, Energy  Transportation  Represents the aggregate total of Construction Industries, Resource Industries, Energy  Transportation and All Other operating segments and related corporate items and eliminations.  2.   Financial Products  Primarily includes the companys Financial Products Segment. This category includes Caterpillar Financial Services Corporation (Cat Financial), Caterpillar Financial Insurance Services (Insurance Services) and their respective subsidiaries.  Other information about our operations in 2014, including certain risks associated with our operations, is incorporated by reference from our Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in Exhibit 13.  Construction Industries  Our Construction Industries segment is primarily responsible for supporting customers using machinery in infrastructure and building construction applications. The majority of machine sales in this segment are made in the heavy construction, general construction, rental, mining and quarry and aggregates markets.  Customer demand for construction machinery has generally been characterized over the past decade by a shift from developed to developing economies. Customers in developing economies often prioritize purchase price in making their investment decisions, while customers in developed economies generally weigh productivity and other performance criteria that contribute to lower lifetime owning and operating costs of a machine. In response to increased demand in developing economies, Caterpillar has developed differentiated product offerings that target customers in those markets, including our SEM brand machines. We believe that these customer-driven product innovations enable us to compete more effectively in developing economies. In those developed economies that are subject to diesel engine emission requirements, we continued our multi-year roll out of products designed to meet those requirements. The majority of Construction Industries' research and development spending in 2014 focused on Tier 4 Final compliance. We believe that these products have been well-received by our customers and are providing us a competitive advantage.  The competitive environment for construction machinery is characterized by some global competitors and many regional and specialized local competitors. Examples of global competitors include Komatsu Ltd., Volvo Construction Equipment (part of the Volvo Group), CNH Industrial N.V., Deere  Company, Hitachi Construction Machinery Co. Ltd., J.C. Bamford Excavators Ltd., Doosan Infracore Co. Ltd., and Hyundai Construction Equipment (part of Hyundai Heavy Industries). As an example of regional and local competitors, our competitors in China also include Guangxi LiuGong Machinery Co. Ltd., Longking Holdings Ltd., Sany Heavy Industry Co. Ltd., Xiamen XGMA Machinery Co. Ltd., XCMG Group, The Shandong Heavy Industry Group Co., Ltd. (Shantui Construction Machinery Co. Ltd.), Strong Construction Machinery Co. Ltd., and Shandong Lingong Construction Machinery Co. Ltd. (part of Volvo Group). Each of these companies has varying product lines that compete with Caterpillar products, and each has varying degrees of regional focus.  The Construction Industries product portfolio includes the following machines and related parts:  ##TABLE_START    backhoe loaders    compact wheel loaders    small track-type tractors   small wheel loaders    track-type loaders   medium track-type tractors   skid steer loaders    mini excavators    select work tools   multi-terrain loaders    small, medium and large track excavators    motor graders  medium wheel loaders    wheel excavators    telehandlers  compact track loaders   pipelayers    mid-tier soil compactors ##TABLE_ENDResource Industries  The Resource Industries segment is primarily responsible for supporting customers using machinery in mine and quarry applications. As a result of the acquisition of Bucyrus International, Inc. (Bucyrus) in July 2011, Caterpillar is able to offer mining customers the broadest product range in the industry. In 2014, Resource Industries substantially completed a three year transition of the former Bucyrus distribution business to the independent Caterpillar dealers who support mining customers. Prior to 2014, the Resource Industries segment also served forestry, paving, and industrial and waste customers. Due to an internal reorganization, these products were reorganized out of Resource Industries effective January 1, 2014 and are now included in the All Other operating segments. The competitive environment for Resource Industries consists of a few larger global competitors that compete in several of the markets that we serve and a substantial number of smaller companies that compete in a more limited range of products, applications, and regional markets. Our global competitors include Komatsu Ltd., Joy Global Inc., Hitachi Construction Machinery Co., Ltd., Volvo Construction Equipment (part of Volvo Group), Atlas Copco, and Sandvik Mining. A number of Chinese companies are active in the mid-tier market, including Guangxi LiuGong Machinery Co., Ltd., XCMG Group and Zhengzhou Coal Mining Machinery Group Co., Ltd. The Resource Industries product portfolio includes the following machines and related parts:  ##TABLE_START   electric rope shovels    large track-type tractors    wheel tractor scrapers   draglines    large mining trucks    wheel dozers   hydraulic shovels    longwall miners    machinery components   drills    large wheel loaders    electronics and control systems   highwall miners    off-highway trucks    select work tools   hard rock vehicles    articulated trucks   ##TABLE_END Energy  Transportation  Our Energy  Transportation segment is primarily responsible for supporting customers using reciprocating engines, turbines, diesel-electric locomotives, integrated systems and solutions, and related parts across industries serving oil and gas, power generation, industrial and marine applications as well as rail-related businesses. Energy  Transportation remains focused on increasing its product offerings and further integrating its products and services to provide complete systems and solutions to its customers.  Regulatory emissions standards of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and similar standards in other developed economies have required us to make significant investments in research and development that will continue as new products are phased in over the next several years. This new product introduction process is the most extensive in our history. We believe that our emissions technology provides a competitive advantage in connection with emissions standards compliance and performance.  The competitive environment for reciprocating engines in marine, oil and gas, industrial and electric power generation systems along with turbines consists of a few larger global competitors that compete in a variety of markets that Caterpillar serves, and a substantial number of smaller companies that compete in a limited-size product range, geographic region and/or application. Principal global competitors include Cummins Inc., Rolls-Royce Power System AG (formerly Tognum AG), GE Oil  Gas, GE Power  Water, Deutz AG and Wartsila Corp. Other competitors, such as MAN Diesel  Turbo SE, Siemens Power  Gas, Rolls-Royce Marine, Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Ltd., Volvo Penta (part of Volvo Group), Weichai Power Co., Ltd., Kirloskar Oil Engines Limited and other emerging market competitors compete in certain markets in which Caterpillar competes. An additional set of competitors, including Generac Power Systems, Inc., Kohler Co., Aggreko PLC and others, are packagers who source engines and/or other components from domestic and international suppliers and market products regionally and internationally through a variety of distribution channels. In rail-related businesses, our global competitors include GE Transportation, Vossloh AG, Siemens AG and Alstom Transport, and Voestalpine AG. We also compete with other companies on a more limited range of products, services and/or geographic regions. The Energy  Transportation product portfolio includes the following: ##TABLE_START  reciprocating engine powered generator sets ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  reciprocating engines supplied to the industrial industry as well as Caterpillar machinery ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  integrated systems used in the electric power generation industry ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  turbines, centrifugal gas compressors and related services ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  reciprocating engines and integrated systems and solutions for the marine and oil and gas industries ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  diesel-electric locomotives and components and other rail-related products and services ##TABLE_END Financial Products Segment  The business of our Financial Products segment is primarily conducted by Cat Financial, a wholly owned finance subsidiary of Caterpillar. Cat Financials primary business is to provide retail and wholesale financing alternatives for Caterpillar products to customers and dealers around the world. Retail financing is primarily comprised of the financing of Caterpillar equipment, machinery and engines. Cat Financial also provides financing for vehicles, power generation facilities and marine vessels that, in most cases, incorporate Caterpillar products. In addition to retail financing, Cat Financial provides wholesale financing to Caterpillar dealers and purchases short-term trade receivables from Caterpillar and its subsidiaries. The various financing plans offered by Cat Financial are primarily designed to increase the opportunity for sales of Caterpillar products and generate financing income for Cat Financial. A significant portion of Cat Financials activities is conducted in North America. Cat Financial also has offices and subsidiaries in Asia/Pacific, Europe and Latin America.  For over 30 years, Cat Financial has been providing financing in the various markets in which it participates, contributing to its knowledge of asset values, industry trends, product structuring and customer needs.  In certain instances, Cat Financials operations are subject to supervision and regulation by state, federal and various foreign governmental authorities, and may be subject to various laws and judicial and administrative decisions imposing requirements and restrictions which, among other things, (i) regulate credit granting activities and the administration of loans, (ii) establish maximum interest rates, finance charges and other charges, (iii) require disclosures to customers and investors, (iv) govern secured transactions, (v) set collection, foreclosure, repossession and other trade practices and (vi) regulate the use and reporting of information related to a borrowers credit experience. Cat Financials ability to comply with these and other governmental and legal requirements and restrictions affects its operations. Cat Financials retail leases and installment sale contracts (totaling 52 percent*) include:  ##TABLE_START  Tax leases that are classified as either operating or finance leases for financial accounting purposes, depending on the characteristics of the lease. For tax purposes, Cat Financial is considered the owner of the equipment (15 percent*). ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  Finance (non-tax) leases, where the lessee for tax purposes is considered to be the owner of the equipment during the term of the lease, that either require or allow the customer to purchase the equipment for a fixed price at the end of the term (18 percent*). ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  Installment sale contracts, which are equipment loans that enable customers to purchase equipment with a down payment or trade-in and structure payments over time (18 percent*). ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  Governmental lease-purchase plans in the U.S. that offer low interest rates and flexible terms to qualified non-federal government agencies (1 percent*). ##TABLE_END  Cat Financials wholesale notes receivable, finance leases and installment sale contracts (totaling 15 percent*) include:  ##TABLE_START  Inventory/rental programs, which provide assistance to dealers by financing their new Caterpillar inventory and rental fleets (5 percent*). ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  Short-term trade receivables Cat Financial purchased from Caterpillar at a discount (10 percent*). ##TABLE_END  Cat Financials retail notes receivables (33 percent*) include:  ##TABLE_START  Loans that allow customers and dealers to use their Caterpillar equipment or other assets as collateral to obtain financing. ##TABLE_END *Indicates the percentage of Cat Financials total portfolio at December 31, 2014. We define total portfolio as total finance receivables (net of unearned income and allowance for credit losses) plus equipment on operating leases, less accumulated depreciation. For more information on the above and Cat Financials concentration of credit risk, please refer to Note 6  Cat Financial Financing Activities of Exhibit 13. _____________________________  Cat Financial operates in a highly competitive environment, with financing for users of Caterpillar equipment available through a variety of sources, principally commercial banks and finance and leasing companies. Cat Financials competitors include Wells Fargo Equipment Finance Inc., General Electric Capital Corporation and various other banks and finance companies. In addition, many of our manufacturing competitors own financial subsidiaries such as Volvo Financial Services, Komatsu Financial L.P. and John Deere Capital Corporation that utilize below-market interest rate programs (funded by the manufacturer) to assist machine sales. Caterpillar and Cat Financial work together to provide a broad array of financial merchandising programs around the world to meet these competitive offers.  Cat Financials financial results are largely dependent upon the ability of Caterpillar dealers to sell equipment and customers willingness to enter into financing or leasing agreements. It is also affected by, among other things, the availability of funds from its financing sources, general economic conditions such as inflation and market interest rates and its cost of funds relative to its competitors.  Cat Financial has a match funding policy that addresses interest rate risk by aligning the interest rate profile (fixed rate or floating rate) of its debt portfolio with the interest rate profile of its receivables portfolio (loans and leases with customers and dealers) within predetermined ranges on an ongoing basis. In connection with that policy, Cat Financial issues debt with a similar interest rate profile to its receivables, and also uses interest rate swap agreements to manage its interest rate risk exposure to interest rate changes and in some cases to lower its cost of borrowed funds. For more information regarding match funding, please see Note 3  Derivative financial instruments and risk management of Exhibit 13. See also the risk factors on pages 8 through 18 for general risks associated with our financial products business included in Item 1A. of this Form 10-K. In managing foreign currency risk for Cat Financials operations, the objective is to minimize earnings volatility resulting from conversion and the remeasurement of net foreign currency balance sheet positions, and future transactions denominated in foreign currencies. This policy allows the use of foreign currency forward, option and cross currency contracts to offset the risk of currency mismatch between the receivable and debt portfolios, and exchange rate risk associated with future transactions denominated in foreign currencies. Substantially all such foreign currency forward, option and cross currency contracts are undesignated.  Cat Financial provides financing only when certain criteria are met. Credit decisions are based on, among other factors, the customers credit history, financial strength and intended use of equipment. Cat Financial typically maintains a security interest in retail-financed equipment and requires physical damage insurance coverage on financed equipment. Cat Financial finances a significant portion of Caterpillar dealers sales and inventory of Caterpillar equipment throughout the world. Cat Financials competitive position is improved by marketing programs offered in conjunction with Caterpillar and/or Caterpillar dealers. Under these programs, Caterpillar, or the dealer, funds an amount at the outset of the transaction, which Cat Financial then recognizes as revenue over the term of the financing. We believe that these marketing programs provide Cat Financial a significant competitive advantage in financing Caterpillar products.

Competitive Environment  Caterpillar products and product support services are sold worldwide into a variety of highly competitive markets. In all markets, we compete on the basis of product performance, customer service, quality and price. From time to time, the intensity of competition results in price discounting in a particular industry or region. Such price discounting puts pressure on margins and can negatively impact operating profit. Outside the United States, certain of our competitors enjoy competitive advantages inherent to operating in their home countries or regions.  Raw Materials and Component Products  We source our raw materials and manufactured components from suppliers both domestically and internationally. These purchases include unformed materials and rough and finished parts. Unformed materials include a variety of steel products, which are then cut or formed to shape and machined in our facilities. Rough parts include various sized steel and iron castings and forgings, which are machined to final specification levels inside our facilities. Finished parts are ready to assemble components, which are made either to Caterpillar specifications or to the supplier developed specifications. We machine and assemble some of the components used in our machines, engines and power generation units and to support our after-market dealer parts sales. We also purchase various goods and services used in production, logistics, offices and product development processes. We maintain global strategic sourcing models to meet our global facilities production needs while building long-term supplier relationships and leveraging enterprise spend. We expect our suppliers to maintain, at all times, industry-leading levels of quality and the ability to timely deliver raw materials and component products for our machine and engine products. We use a variety of agreements with suppliers to protect our intellectual property and processes to monitor and mitigate risks of the supply base causing a business disruption. The risks monitored include supplier financial viability, the ability to increase or decrease production levels, business continuity, quality and delivery.  Order Backlog  The dollar amount of backlog believed to be firm was approximately $17.3 billion at December 31, 2014 and $18.0 billion at December 31, 2013. Compared to year-end 2013, the order backlog declined about $700 million. Decreases in Resource Industries were partially offset by increases in Energy  Transportation. In 2013, the order backlog declined significantly for mining-related products within Resource Industries and declined slightly for Energy  Transportation. These declines were partially offset by a substantial increase in Construction Industries. Of the total backlog at December 31, 2014, approximately $3.0 billion was not expected to be filled in 2015. Dealers and Distributors  Our machines are distributed principally through a worldwide organization of dealers (dealer network), 48 located in the United States and 129 located outside the United States, serving 182 countries and operating 3,580 places of business, including 1,267 dealer rental outlets. Reciprocating engines are sold principally through the dealer network and to other manufacturers for use in their products. Some of the reciprocating engines manufactured by our subsidiary Perkins Engines Company Limited, are also sold through a worldwide network of 103 distributors located in 182 countries. Some of the electric power generation systems manufactured by our subsidiary Caterpillar Northern Ireland Limited, formerly known as F.G. Wilson Engineering Limited, are sold through its worldwide network of 264 distributors located in 145 countries. Some of the large, medium speed reciprocating engines are also sold under the MaK brand through a worldwide network of 19 distributors located in 130 countries.  Our dealers do not deal exclusively with our products; however, in most cases sales and servicing of our products are the dealers principal business. Some products, primarily turbines and locomotives, are sold directly to end customers through sales forces employed by the company. At times, these employees are assisted by independent sales representatives. While the large majority of our worldwide dealers are independently owned and operated, we own and operate a dealership in Japan that covers approximately 85% of the Japanese market: Nippon Caterpillar Division. We are currently operating this Japanese dealer directly and its results are reported in the All Other operating segments. There are also three independent dealers in the Southern Region of Japan.  For Caterpillar branded products, the companys relationship with each of its independent dealers is memorialized in a standard sales and service agreement. Pursuant to this agreement, the company grants the dealer the right to purchase and sell its products and to service the products in a specified geographic service territory. Prices to dealers are established by the company after receiving input from dealers on transactional pricing in the marketplace. The company also agrees to defend its intellectual property and to provide warranty and technical support to the dealer. The agreement further grants the dealer a non-exclusive license to use the companys trademarks, service marks and brand names. In some instances, a separate trademark agreement exists between the company and a dealer.  In exchange for these rights, the agreement obligates the dealer to develop and promote the sale of the companys products to current and prospective customers in the dealers service territory. Each dealer agrees to employ adequate sales and support personnel to market, sell and promote the companys products, demonstrate and exhibit the products, perform the companys product improvement programs, inform the company concerning any features that might affect the safe operation of any of the companys products and maintain detailed books and records of the dealers financial condition, sales and inventories and make these books and records available at the companys reasonable request.  These sales and service agreements are terminable at will by either party primarily upon 90 days written notice and provide for termination automatically if the dealer files for bankruptcy protection or upon the occurrence of comparable action seeking protection from creditors.  Patents and Trademarks  Our products are sold primarily under the brands Caterpillar, CAT, design versions of CAT and Caterpillar, Electro-Motive, FG Wilson, MaK, MWM, Perkins, Progress Rail, SEM and Solar Turbines. We own a number of patents and trademarks, which have been obtained over a period of years and relate to the products we manufacture and the services we provide. These patents and trademarks have been of value in the growth of our business and may continue to be of value in the future. We do not regard our business as being dependent upon any single patent or group of patents.  Research and Development  We have always placed strong emphasis on product-oriented research and development relating to the development of new or improved machines, engines and major components. In 2014, 2013 and 2012, we spent $2,135 million, $2,046 million and $2,466 million, or 3.9, 3.7, and 3.7 percent of our sales and revenues, respectively, on our research and development programs. Research and development expense is expected to increase about 10 percent in 2015.  Employment  As of December 31, 2014, we employed 114,233 full-time persons of whom 63,419 were located outside the United States. In the United States, most of our 50,814 employees are at-will employees and, therefore, not subject to any type of employment contract or agreement. At select business units, certain highly specialized employees have been hired under employment contracts that specify a term of employment and specify pay and other benefits. As of December 31, 2014, there were approximately 10,400 U.S. hourly production employees who were covered by collective bargaining agreements with various labor unions, including The United Automobile, Aerospace and Agricultural Implement Workers of America (UAW), The International Association of Machinists and The United Steelworkers. Approximately 7,700 of such employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements with the UAW that expire on March 1, 2017 and December 17, 2018. Outside the United States, the company enters into employment contracts and agreements in those countries in which such relationships are mandatory or customary. The provisions of these agreements correspond in each case with the required or customary terms in the subject jurisdiction.  Sales and Revenues  Sales and revenues outside the United States were 62 percent of consolidated sales and revenues for 2014, 67 percent for 2013 and 69 percent for 2012.  Environmental Matters  The company is regulated by federal, state and international environmental laws governing our use, transport and disposal of substances and control of emissions. In addition to governing our manufacturing and other operations, these laws often impact the development of our products, including, but not limited to, required compliance with air emissions standards applicable to internal combustion engines. We have made, and will continue to make, significant research and development and capital expenditures to comply with these emissions standards.  We are engaged in remedial activities at a number of locations, often with other companies, pursuant to federal and state laws. When it is probable we will pay remedial costs at a site, and those costs can be reasonably estimated, the investigation, remediation, and operating and maintenance costs are accrued against our earnings. Costs are accrued based on consideration of currently available data and information with respect to each individual site, including available technologies, current applicable laws and regulations, and prior remediation experience. Where no amount within a range of estimates is more likely, we accrue the minimum. Where multiple potentially responsible parties are involved, we consider our proportionate share of the probable costs. In formulating the estimate of probable costs, we do not consider amounts expected to be recovered from insurance companies or others. We reassess these accrued amounts on a quarterly basis. The amount recorded for environmental remediation is not material and is included in the line item \"Accrued expenses\" in Statement 3 -- \"Consolidated Financial Position at December 31\" of Exhibit 13. There is no more than a remote chance that a material amount for remedial activities at any individual site, or at all the sites in the aggregate, will be required.

Risk Factors. ##TABLE_END  The statements in this section describe the most significant risks to our business and should be considered carefully in conjunction with Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements of Exhibit 13 to this Form 10-K. In addition, the statements in this section and other sections of this Form 10-K, including in \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\" in Exhibit 13, include forward-looking statements as that term is defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and involve uncertainties that could significantly impact results. Forward-looking statements give current expectations or forecasts of future events about the company or our outlook. You can identify forward-looking statements by the fact they do not relate to historical or current facts and by the use of words such as believe, expect, estimate, anticipate, will be, should, plan, project, intend, could and similar words or expressions.  Forward-looking statements are based on assumptions and on known risks and uncertainties. Although we believe we have been prudent in our assumptions, any or all of our forward-looking statements may prove to be inaccurate, and we can make no guarantees about our future performance. Should known or unknown risks or uncertainties materialize or underlying assumptions prove inaccurate, actual results could materially differ from past results and/or those anticipated, estimated or projected. We undertake no obligation to publicly update forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. You should, however, consult any subsequent disclosures we make in our filings with the SEC on Form 10-Q or Form 8-K.  The following is a cautionary discussion of risks, uncertainties and assumptions that we believe are significant to our business. In addition to the factors discussed elsewhere in this report, the following are some of the important factors that, individually or in the aggregate, we believe could make our actual results differ materially from those described in any forward-looking statements. It is impossible to predict or identify all such factors and, as a result, you should not consider the following factors to be a complete discussion of risks, uncertainties and assumptions.  Our business is highly sensitive to global and regional economic conditions and economic conditions in the industries we serve.  Our results of operations are materially affected by economic conditions globally and regionally and in the particular industries we serve. The demand for our products and services tends to be cyclical and can be significantly reduced in an economic environment characterized by lower levels of government and business investment, lower levels of business confidence, lower corporate earnings, higher unemployment and lower consumer spending. A prolonged period of slow growth may also reduce demand for our products and services. Economic conditions vary across regions and countries, and demand for our products generally increases in those regions and countries experiencing economic growth and investment. A change in the global mix of regions and countries experiencing economic growth and investment could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.  The energy and mining industries are major users of our products, including the coal, iron ore, gold, copper, oil and natural gas industries. Decisions to purchase our products are dependent upon the performance of these industries, which in turn are dependent in part on commodity prices. Increases in demand or output in these industries may lead to increases in demand for our products. Conversely, if demand or output in these industries declines, the demand for our products will generally decrease. Prices of commodities in these industries are frequently volatile and can change abruptly and unpredictibly in response to general economic conditions, economic growth, government actions, regulatory actions, commodity inventories and any disruptions in production or distribution. We assume certain prices for key commodities in preparing our general economic and financial outlooks (outlooks). Commodity prices lower than those assumed in our outlooks may negatively impact our business, results of operations and financial condition. Economic conditions affecting the industries we serve may in the future also lead to reduced capital expenditures by our customers. Reduced capital expenditures by our customers are likely to lead to a decrease in the demand for our products and may also result in a decrease in demand for aftermarket parts as customers are likely to extend proactive maintenance schedules and delay major overhauls when possible.   The rates of infrastructure spending, housing starts and commercial construction also play a significant role in our results. Our products are an integral component of these activities, and as these activities decrease inside or outside of the United States, demand for our products may be significantly impacted, which could negatively impact our results. Slower rates of economic growth than anticipated in our outlooks could also adversely impact our business, results of operations and financial condition.  Changes in government monetary or fiscal policies may negatively impact our results .  Most countries have established central banks to regulate monetary systems and influence economic activities, generally by adjusting interest rates. Interest rate changes affect overall economic growth, which affects demand for residential and nonresidential structures, as well as energy and mined products, which in turn affects sales of our products that serve these activities. Interest rate changes also affect our customers ability to finance machine purchases, can change the optimal time to keep machines in a fleet and can impact the ability of our suppliers to finance the production of parts and components necessary to manufacture and support our products. Our outlooks typically include assumptions about interest rates in a number of countries. Interest rates higher than those contained in our assumptions could result in lower sales than anticipated and supply chain inefficiencies.  Central banks and other policy arms of many countries take actions to vary the amount of liquidity and credit available in an economy. Liquidity and credit policies different from those assumed in our outlooks could impact the customers and markets we serve or our suppliers, which could adversely impact our business, results of operations and financial condition. Changes in monetary and fiscal policies, along with other factors, may cause currency exchange rates to fluctuate. Actions that lead the currency exchange rate of a country where we manufacture products to increase relative to other currencies could reduce the competitiveness of products made in that country, which could adversely affect our competitive position, results of operations and financial condition. Government policies on taxes and spending also affect our business. Throughout the world, government spending finances a significant portion of infrastructure development, such as highways, airports, sewer and water systems and dams. Tax regulations determine depreciation lives and the amount of money users of our products can retain, both of which influence investment decisions. Unfavorable developments, such as declines in government revenues, decisions to reduce public spending or increases in taxes, could negatively impact our results.  Commodity price changes, component price increases, fluctuations in demand for our products or significant shortages of component products may adversely impact our financial results or our ability to meet commitments to customers.  We are a significant user of steel and many other commodities required for the manufacture of our products. Unanticipated increases in the prices of such commodities would increase our costs, negatively impacting our business, results of operations and financial condition if we are unable to fully offset the effect of these increased costs through price increases, productivity improvements or cost reduction programs.  We rely on suppliers to secure component products, particularly steel, required for the manufacture of our products. A disruption in deliveries to or from suppliers or decreased availability of components or commodities could have an adverse effect on our ability to meet our commitments to customers or increase our operating costs. On the other hand, if demand for our products is less than we expect, we may experience excess inventories and be forced to incur additional charges and our profitability may suffer. Our business, competitive position, results of operations or financial condition could be negatively impacted if supply is insufficient for our operations. Our financial condition and results of operations may be negatively impacted if we experience excess inventories or we are unable to adjust our production schedules or our purchases from suppliers to reflect changes in customer demand and market fluctuations on a timely basis.  Disruptions or volatility in global financial markets could limit our sources of liquidity, or the liquidity of our customers, dealers and suppliers.  Global economic conditions may cause volatility and disruptions in the capital and credit markets. Although we have generated funds from our operations to pay our operating expenses, fund our capital expenditures and support growth, fund our employee retirement benefit programs, pay dividends and buy back stock, continuing to meet these cash requirements over the long-term requires substantial liquidity and access to varied sources of funds, including capital and credit markets. Changes in global economic conditions, including material cost increases and decreases in economic activity in the markets that we serve, and the success of plans to manage cost increases, inventory and other important elements of our business may significantly impact our ability to generate funds from operations. Market volatility, changes in counterparty credit risk, the impact of government intervention in financial markets and general economic conditions may also adversely impact our ability to access capital and credit markets to fund operating needs. Global or regional economic downturns could cause financial markets to decrease the availability of liquidity, credit and credit capacity for certain issuers, including certain of our customers, dealers and suppliers. An inability to access capital and credit markets may have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and competitive position.  In addition, demand for our products generally depends on customers ability to pay for our products, which, in turn, depends on their access to funds. Subject to global economic conditions, customers may experience increased difficulty in generating funds from operations. Capital and credit market volatility and uncertainty may cause financial institutions to revise their lending standards, resulting in decreased access to capital. If capital and credit market volatility occurs, customers liquidity may decline which, in turn, would reduce their ability to purchase our products. Our global operations are exposed to political and economic risks, commercial instability and events beyond our control in the countries in which we operate.  Our global operations are dependent upon products manufactured, purchased and sold in the U.S. and internationally, including in countries with political and economic instability. In some cases, these countries have greater political and economic volatility and greater vulnerability to infrastructure and labor disruptions than in our other markets. Our business could be negatively impacted by adverse fluctuations in freight costs, limitations on shipping and receiving capacity, and other disruptions in the transportation and shipping infrastructure at important geographic points of exit and entry for our products. Operating and seeking to expand business in a number of different regions and countries exposes us to a number of risks, including:  ##TABLE_START  multiple and potentially conflicting laws, regulations and policies that are subject to change; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  imposition of currency restrictions, restrictions on repatriation of earnings or other restraints; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  imposition of burdensome tariffs or quotas; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  imposition of new or additional trade and economic sanctions laws imposed by the U.S. or foreign governments; ##TABLE_END 10 ##TABLE_START  national and international conflict, including the ongoing conflict in Ukraine; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  war or terrorist acts; and ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  political and economic instability or civil unrest that may severely disrupt economic activity in affected countries. ##TABLE_END  The occurrence of one or more of these events may negatively impact our business, results of operations and financial condition.  Failure to maintain our credit ratings would increase our cost of borrowing and could adversely affect our cost of funds, liquidity, competitive position and access to capital markets.  Each of Caterpillars and Cat Financials costs of borrowing and ability to access the capital markets are affected not only by market conditions but also by the short- and long-term debt ratings assigned to their respective debt by the major credit rating agencies. These ratings are based, in significant part, on each of Caterpillars and Cat Financials performance as measured by financial metrics such as net worth and interest coverage and leverage ratios, as well as transparency with rating agencies and timeliness of financial reporting. There can be no assurance that Caterpillar or Cat Financial will be able to maintain their credit ratings and the failure of either Caterpillar or Cat Financial to do so could adversely affect our cost of funds, liquidity, competitive position and access to the capital markets, including restricting, in whole or in part, our access to the commercial paper market. There can be no assurance that the commercial paper market will continue to be a reliable source of short-term financing for Cat Financial or an available source of short-term financing for Caterpillar. An inability to access the capital markets could have an adverse effect on our cash flow, results of operations and financial condition.  Our Financial Products segment is subject to risks associated with the financial services industry.  Cat Financial is significant to our operations and provides financing support to a significant share of our global sales. The inability of Cat Financial to access funds to support its financing activities to our customers could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Continuing to meet Cat Financial's cash requirements over the long-term could require substantial liquidity and access to sources of funds, including capital and credit markets. Cat Financial has continued to maintain access to key global medium term note and commercial paper markets, but there can be no assurance that such markets will continue to represent a reliable source of financing. If global economic conditions were to deteriorate, Cat Financial could face materially higher financing costs, become unable to access adequate funding to operate and grow its business and/or meet its debt service obligations as they mature, and be required to draw upon contractually committed lending agreements and/or by seeking other funding sources. However, there can be no assurance that such agreements and other funding sources would be available or sufficient under extreme market conditions. Any of these events could negatively impact Cat Financials business, as well as our and Cat Financial's results of operations and financial condition.  Market disruption and volatility may also lead to a number of other risks in connection with these events, including but not limited to:  ##TABLE_START  Market developments that may affect customer confidence levels and cause declines in the demand for financing and adverse changes in payment patterns, causing increases in delinquencies and default rates, which could impact Cat Financials write-offs and provision for credit losses. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  The process Cat Financial uses to estimate losses inherent in its credit exposure requires a high degree of managements judgment regarding numerous subjective qualitative factors, including forecasts of economic conditions and how economic predictors might impair the ability of its borrowers to repay their loans. Financial market disruption and volatility may impact the accuracy of these judgments. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  Cat Financials ability to engage in routine funding transactions or borrow from other financial institutions on acceptable terms or at all could be adversely affected by disruptions in the capital markets or other events, including actions by rating agencies and deteriorating investor expectations. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  As Cat Financials counterparties are primarily financial institutions, their ability to perform in accordance with any of its underlying agreements could be adversely affected by market volatility and/or disruptions in financial markets. ##TABLE_END Changes in interest rates or market liquidity conditions could adversely affect Cat Financial's and our earnings and/or cash flow.  Changes in interest rates and market liquidity conditions could have an adverse effect on Cat Financial's and our earnings and cash flows. Because a significant number of the loans made by Cat Financial are made at fixed interest rates, its business is subject to fluctuations in interest rates. Changes in market interest rates may influence its financing costs, returns on financial investments and the valuation of derivative contracts and could reduce its and our earnings and cash flows. Although Cat Financial manages interest rate and market liquidity risks through a variety of techniques, including a match funding program, the selective use of derivatives and a broadly diversified funding program, there can be no assurance that fluctuations in interest rates and market liquidity conditions will not have an adverse effect on its and our earnings and cash flows. If any of the variety of instruments and strategies Cat Financial uses to hedge its exposure to these types of risk is ineffective, we may incur losses. With respect to Insurance Services' investment activities, changes in the equity and bond markets could cause an impairment of the value of its investment portfolio, requiring a negative adjustment to earnings. An increase in delinquencies, repossessions or net losses of Cat Financial customers could adversely affect its results.  Inherent in the operation of Cat Financial is the credit risk associated with its customers. The creditworthiness of each customer and the rate of delinquencies, repossessions and net losses on customer obligations are directly impacted by several factors, including relevant industry and economic conditions, the availability of capital, the experience and expertise of the customer's management team, commodity prices, political events and the sustained value of the underlying collateral. Any increase in delinquencies, repossessions and net losses on customer obligations could have a material adverse effect on Cat Financial's and our earnings and cash flows. In addition, although Cat Financial evaluates and adjusts its allowance for credit losses related to past due and non-performing receivables on a regular basis, adverse economic conditions or other factors that might cause deterioration of the financial health of its customers could change the timing and level of payments received and thus necessitate an increase in Cat Financial's estimated losses, which could also have a material adverse effect on Cat Financial's and our earnings and cash flows.  New regulations or changes in financial services regulation could adversely impact Caterpillar and Cat Financial.  Cat Financials operations are highly regulated by governmental authorities in the locations where it operates, which can impose significant additional costs and/or restrictions on its business. In the U.S., for example, certain of Cat Financials activities are subject to the U.S. Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Dodd-Frank). Dodd-Frank was signed into law in July 2010 and is a comprehensive financial reform act that includes extensive provisions regulating the financial services industry. Certain aspects of Dodd-Frank remain to be implemented under the rulemaking and regulatory authority of the SEC, the United States Commodity Futures Trading Commission and federal banking regulators. As such, Cat Financial has become and could continue to become subject to additional regulatory costs both directly and indirectly, through increased costs of doing business with marketing intermediaries that are now subject to extensive regulation pursuant to Dodd-Frank and other regulatory initiatives. For example, derivatives dealers may seek to pass to us the cost of any margin, capital or other regulatory requirements to which they become subject to under Dodd-Frank, or other regulatory reforms. As the regulatory regime is still developing and the rulemaking process has been progressing slowly, the ultimate costs and impact of Dodd-Frank and other regulatory initiatives on Cat Financials business remain uncertain and may not be known for years. However, such costs could be significant  and have an adverse effect on Cat Financial's and our results of operations and financial condition. Additional regulations in the U.S. or internationally impacting the financial services industry could also add significant cost or operational constraints that might have an adverse effect on Cat Financial's and our results of operations and financial condition. We may not realize all of the anticipated benefits of our acquisitions, joint ventures or divestitures, or these benefits may take longer to realize than expected. In pursuing our business strategy, we routinely evaluate targets and enter into agreements regarding possible acquisitions, divestitures and joint ventures. We often compete with others for the same opportunities. To be successful, we conduct due diligence to identify valuation issues and potential loss contingencies, negotiate transaction terms, complete complex transactions and manage post-closing matters such as the integration of acquired businesses. Our due diligence reviews are subject to the completeness and accuracy of disclosures made by third parties. We may incur unanticipated costs or expenses following a completed acquisition, including post-closing asset impairment charges, expenses associated with eliminating duplicate facilities, litigation, and other liabilities. The risks associated with our past or future acquisitions also include the following:  ##TABLE_START  the business culture of the acquired business may not match well with our culture; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  technological and product synergies, economies of scale and cost reductions may not occur as expected; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  unforeseen expenses, delays or conditions may be imposed upon the acquisition, including due to required regulatory approvals or consents; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  we may acquire or assume unexpected liabilities or be subject to unexpected penalties or other enforcement actions; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  faulty assumptions may be made regarding the integration process; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  unforeseen difficulties may arise in integrating operations, processes and systems; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  higher than expected investments may be required to implement necessary compliance processes and related systems, including IT systems, accounting systems and internal controls over financial reporting; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  we may fail to retain, motivate and integrate key management and other employees of the acquired business; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  higher than expected costs may arise due to unforeseen changes in tax, trade, environmental, labor, safety, payroll or pension policies in any jurisdiction in which the acquired business conducts its operations; and ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  we may experience problems in retaining customers and integrating customer bases. ##TABLE_END Many of these factors will be outside of our control and any one of them could result in increased costs, decreases in the amount of expected revenues and diversion of managements time and attention. They may also delay the realization of the benefits we anticipate when we enter into a transaction.  In order to conserve cash for operations, we may undertake acquisitions financed in part through public offerings or private placements of debt or equity securities, or other arrangements. Such acquisition financing could result in a decrease of our ratio of earnings to fixed charges and adversely affect other leverage measures. If we issue equity securities or equity-linked securities, the issued securities may have a dilutive effect on the interests of the holders of our common shares.  Failure to implement our acquisition strategy, including successfully integrating acquired businesses, could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Furthermore, we make strategic divestitures from time to time. In the case of divestitures, we may agree to indemnify acquiring parties for certain liabilities arising from our former businesses. These divestitures may also result in continued financial involvement in the divested businesses, including through guarantees or other financial arrangements, following the transaction. Lower performance by those divested businesses could affect our future financial results.  International trade policies may impact demand for our products and our competitive position.  Government policies on international trade and investment such as import quotas, capital controls or tariffs, whether adopted by individual governments or addressed by regional trade blocs, can affect the demand for our products and services, impact the competitive position of our products or prevent us from being able to sell products in certain countries. The implementation of more restrictive trade policies, such as more detailed inspections, higher tariffs or new barriers to entry, in countries where we sell large quantities of products and services could negatively impact our business, results of operations and financial condition. For example, a governments adoption of buy national policies or retaliation by another government against such policies could have a negative impact on our results of operations.  The success of our business depends on our ability to develop, produce and market quality products that meet our customers needs.  Our business relies on continued global demand for our brands and products. To achieve business goals, we must develop and sell products that appeal to our dealers, OEMs and customers. This is dependent on a number of factors, including our ability to maintain key dealer relationships, our ability to produce products that meet the quality, performance and price expectations of our customers and our ability to develop effective sales, advertising and marketing programs. In addition, our continued success in selling products that appeal to our customers is dependent on leading-edge innovation, with respect to both products and operations, and on the availability and effectiveness of legal protection for our innovation. Failure to continue to deliver high quality, innovative, competitive products to the marketplace, to adequately protect our intellectual property rights, to supply products that meet applicable regulatory requirements, including diesel engine emission requirements and equivalent standards, or to predict market demands for, or gain market acceptance of, our products, could have a negative impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition. We operate in a highly competitive environment, which could adversely affect our sales and pricing.  We operate in a highly competitive environment, and our outlook depends on a forecast of our share of industry sales based on our ability to compete with others in the marketplace. We compete on the basis of a variety of factors, including product performance, customer service, quality and price. There can be no assurance that our products will be able to compete successfully with other companies products. Thus, our share of industry sales could be reduced due to aggressive pricing or product strategies pursued by competitors, unanticipated product or manufacturing difficulties, our failure to price our products competitively, our failure to produce our products at a competitive cost or an unexpected buildup in competitors new machine or dealer-owned rental fleets, leading to severe downward pressure on machine rental rates and/or used equipment prices.  Our sales outlook assumes that certain price increases we announce from time to time will be realized in the marketplace. Changes in market acceptance of price increases, changes in market requirements for price discounts, changes in our competitors behavior or a weak pricing environment attributable to industry overcapacity could have an adverse impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition.  In addition, our results and ability to compete may be impacted negatively by changes in our sales mix. Our outlook assumes a certain geographic mix of sales as well as a certain product mix of sales. If actual results vary from this projected geographic and product mix of sales, our results could be negatively impacted.  We may not realize all of the anticipated benefits from cost-reduction initiatives, cash flow improvement initiatives and efficiency or productivity initiatives. We are actively engaged in a number of initiatives to increase our productivity, efficiency and cash flow and to reduce costs, which we expect to have a positive effect on our business, competitive position, results of operations and financial condition. For example, we formed the Caterpillar Enterprise System Group in 2013 to implement sustained improvements in our operational efficiency and order-to-delivery processes so that our lead time is better aligned with customer requirements, as well as to reduce waste, further enhance quality and maximize value for our customers. We are also in the process of implementing a new enterprise resource planning (ERP) system in many of our businesses to increase efficiency and harmonize our operations. There can be no assurance that this ERP system, these initiatives, or others will continue to be beneficial to the extent anticipated, or that the estimated efficiency improvements, incremental cost savings or cash flow improvements will be realized as anticipated or at all. If our new ERP system is not implemented successfully, it could have an adverse effect on our operations and competitive position. We expect to incur additional restructuring charges as we continue to contemplate cost reduction actions in an effort to optimize our cost structure and may not achieve the anticipated savings and benefits of these actions. Throughout 2014, we implemented restructuring plans and incurred significant separation-related charges primarily related to a reduction in workforce at our Gosselies, Belgium, facility. We expect to take restructuring actions in 2015 to optimize our cost structure and improve the efficiency of our operation, which will reduce our profitability in the periods incurred. As a result of these actions, we will likely continue to incur charges, which may include but not be limited to asset impairments, employee termination costs, charges for pension and other postretirement contractual benefits, potential additional pension funding obligations, and pension curtailments, any of which could be significant, and could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. In addition, we may not realize anticipated savings or benefits from past or future cost reduction actions in full or in part or within the time periods we expect. We are also subject to the risks of labor unrest, negative publicity and business disruption in connection with our cost reduction actions. Failure to realize anticipated savings or benefits from our cost reduction actions could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition, liquidity, results of operations and cash flows. Our business is subject to the inventory management decisions and sourcing practices of our dealers and our OEM customers.  We sell finished products primarily through an independent dealer network and directly to OEMs and are subject to risks relating to their inventory management decisions and operational and sourcing practices. Both carry inventories of finished products as part of ongoing operations and adjust those inventories based on their assessments of future needs. Such adjustments may impact our results positively or negatively. If the inventory levels of our dealers and OEM customers are higher than they desire, they may postpone product purchases from us, which could cause our sales to be lower than the end-user demand for our products and negatively impact our results. Similarly, our results could be negatively impacted through the loss of time-sensitive sales if our dealers and OEM customers do not maintain inventory levels sufficient to meet customer demand. Additionally, some of our engine customers are OEMs that manufacture or could in the future manufacture engines for their own products. Despite their engine manufacturing abilities, these customers have chosen to outsource certain types of engine production to us due to the quality of our engine products and in order to reduce costs, eliminate production risks and maintain company focus. However, there can be no assurance that these customers will continue to outsource engine manufacture in the future. Decreased levels of production outsourcing by these customers could result from a number of factors, such as shifts in our customers business strategies, acquisition by a customer of another engine manufacturer, the inability of third-party suppliers to meet specifications and the emergence of low-cost production opportunities in foreign countries. A significant reduction in the level of engine production outsourcing from our OEM customers could significantly impact our revenues and, accordingly, have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. We are subject to stringent environmental laws and regulations that impose significant compliance costs.  Our facilities, operations and products are subject to increasingly stringent environmental laws and regulations globally, including laws and regulations governing emissions to noise, air, discharges to water and the generation, handling, storage, transportation, treatment and disposal of non-hazardous and hazardous waste materials. Some environmental laws impose strict, retroactive and joint and several liability for the remediation of the release of hazardous substances, even for conduct that was lawful at the time it occurred, or for the conduct of, or conditions caused by, prior operators, predecessors or other third parties. Failure to comply with environmental laws could expose us to penalties or clean-up costs, civil or criminal liability and sanctions on certain of our activities, as well as damage to property or natural resources. These liabilities, sanctions, damages and remediation efforts related to any non-compliance with such laws and regulations could negatively impact our ability to conduct our operations and our financial condition and results of operations. In addition, there can be no assurances that we will not be adversely affected by costs, liabilities or claims with respect to existing or subsequently acquired operations or under present laws and regulations or those that may be adopted or imposed in the future. Environmental laws and regulations may also change from time to time, as may related interpretations and other guidance. Changes in environmental laws or regulations could result in higher expenses and payments, and uncertainty relating to environmental laws or regulations may also affect how we conduct our operations and structure our investments and could limit our ability to enforce our rights. Changes in environmental and climate change laws or regulations, including laws relating to greenhouse gas emissions, could lead to new or additional investment in product designs and could increase environmental compliance expenditures. Changes in climate change concerns, or in the regulation of such concerns, including greenhouse gas emissions, could subject us to additional costs and restrictions, including increased energy and raw materials costs. If environmental laws or regulations are either changed or adopted and impose significant operational restrictions and compliance requirements upon us or our products, they could negatively impact our business, capital expenditures, results of operations, financial condition and competitive position.  Our global operations are subject to extensive trade and anti-corruption laws and regulations.  Due to the international scope of our operations, we are subject to a complex system of import- and export-related laws and regulations, including U.S. regulations issued by Customs and Border Protection, the Bureau of Industry and Security, the Office of Antiboycott Compliance, the Directorate of Defense Trade Controls and the Office of Foreign Assets Control, as well as the counterparts of these agencies in other countries. Any alleged or actual violations may subject us to government scrutiny, investigation and civil and criminal penalties, and may limit our ability to import or export our products or to provide services outside the United States. Furthermore, embargoes and sanctions imposed by the U.S. and other governments restricting or prohibiting sales to specific persons or countries or based on product classification expose us to potential criminal and civil sanctions. We cannot predict the nature, scope or effect of future regulatory requirements to which our operations might be subject or the manner in which existing laws might be administered or interpreted.  In addition, the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and similar foreign anti-corruption laws generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments or providing anything of value to improperly influence foreign government officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business, or obtaining an unfair advantage. Recent years have seen a substantial increase in the global enforcement of anti-corruption laws. Our operations outside the United States, including in developing countries, could increase the risk of such violations. In addition, we enter into joint ventures with joint venture partners who are domiciled in areas of the world with laws, regulations and business practices that differ from those in the United States. There is risk that our joint venture partners will violate applicable laws and regulations. Violations of anti- corruption laws or regulations by our employees, by intermediaries acting on our behalf, or by our joint venture partners may result in severe criminal or civil sanctions, could disrupt our business, and result in an adverse effect on our reputation, business and results of operations or financial condition. We may incur additional tax expense or become subject to additional tax exposure.  We are subject to income taxes in the United States and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Our domestic and international tax liabilities are dependent upon the location of earnings among these different jurisdictions. Our future results of operations could be adversely affected by changes in the effective tax rate as a result of a change in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in our overall profitability, changes in tax legislation and rates, changes in generally accepted accounting principles, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, changes in the amount of earnings permanently reinvested offshore, the results of audits and examinations of previously filed tax returns and continuing assessments of our tax exposures. We are also subject to the continuous examination of our income tax returns by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities. For information regarding additional legal matters related to our taxes, please see Note 5 (Income taxes) and Note 22 (Environmental and legal matters) to our consolidated financial statements in Exhibit 13 to this Annual Report on Form 10-K . We regularly assess the likelihood of an adverse outcome resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for taxes. There can be no assurance as to the outcome of these examinations. If our effective tax rates were to increase, or if the ultimate determination of our taxes owed is for an amount in excess of amounts previously accrued, our operating results, cash flows and financial condition could be adversely affected.  Currency exchange rate fluctuations affect our results of operations, as reported in our financial statements.  We conduct operations in many areas of the world, involving transactions denominated in a variety of currencies. We are subject to currency exchange rate risk to the extent that our costs are denominated in currencies other than those in which we earn revenues. In addition, because our financial statements are reported in U.S. dollars, changes in currency exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and other currencies have had, and will continue to have, an impact on our results of operations. While we customarily enter into financial transactions to address these risks, there can be no assurance that currency exchange rate fluctuations will not adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. While the use of currency hedging instruments may provide us with protection from adverse fluctuations in currency exchange rates, by utilizing these instruments we potentially forego the benefits that might result from favorable fluctuations in currency exchange rates. In addition, our outlooks do not assume fluctuations in currency exchange rates. Adverse fluctuations in currency exchange rates from the date of our outlooks could cause our actual results to differ materially from those anticipated in our outlooks and adversely impact our business, results of operations and financial condition.  We also face risks arising from the imposition of exchange controls and currency devaluations. Exchange controls may limit our ability to convert foreign currencies into U.S. dollars or to remit dividends and other payments by our foreign subsidiaries or businesses located in or conducted within a country imposing controls. Currency devaluations result in a diminished value of funds denominated in the currency of the country instituting the devaluation.  Restrictive covenants in our debt agreements could limit our financial and operating flexibility.  We maintain a number of credit facilities to support general corporate purposes (facilities) and have issued debt securities to manage liquidity and fund operations (debt securities). The agreements relating to a number of the facilities and the debt securities contain certain restrictive covenants applicable to us and certain of our subsidiaries, including Cat Financial. These covenants include maintaining a consolidated net worth (defined as the consolidated stockholders equity including preferred stock but excluding the pension and other post-retirement benefits balance within accumulated other comprehensive income (loss)) of not less than $9 billion, limitations on the incurrence of liens and certain restrictions on consolidation and merger. Cat Financial has also agreed under certain of these agreements to maintain a leverage ratio (consolidated debt to consolidated net worth, calculated (1) on a monthly basis as the average of the leverage ratios determined on the last day of each of the six preceding calendar months and (2) at each December 31) not greater than 10.0 to 1, to maintain a minimum interest coverage ratio (profit excluding income taxes, interest expense and net gain/(loss) from interest rate derivatives to interest expense, calculated at the end of each calendar quarter for the rolling four quarter period then most recently ended) of not less than 1.15 to 1 and not to terminate, amend or modify its support agreement with us.  A breach of one or more of the covenants could result in adverse consequences that could negatively impact our business, results of operations and financial condition. These consequences may include the acceleration of amounts outstanding under certain of the facilities, triggering of an obligation to redeem certain debt securities, termination of existing unused commitments by our lenders, refusal by our lenders to extend further credit under one or more of the facilities or to enter into new facilities or the lowering or modification of our credit ratings or those of one or more of our subsidiaries.  Sustained increases in funding obligations under our pension plans may reduce our profitability.  We maintain certain defined benefit pension plans for our employees, which impose on us certain funding obligations. In determining our future payment obligations under the plans, we assume certain rates of return on the plan assets and growth rates of certain costs. Significant adverse changes in credit or capital markets could result in actual rates of return being materially lower than projected and increased pension expense in future years. We may be required to make contributions to our pension plans in the future, and these contributions could be material. Our cost growth rates may also be materially higher than projected. These factors could significantly increase our payment obligations under the plans, and as a result, adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.  Union disputes or other labor matters could adversely affect our operations and financial results .  Some of our employees are represented by labor unions in a number of countries under various collective bargaining agreements with varying durations and expiration dates. There can be no assurance that any current or future issues with our employees will be resolved or that we will not encounter future strikes, work stoppages or other types of conflicts with labor unions or our employees. We may not be able to satisfactorily renegotiate collective bargaining agreements in the United States and other countries when they expire. If we fail to renegotiate our existing collective bargaining agreements, we could encounter strikes or work stoppages or other types of conflicts with labor unions. In addition, existing collective bargaining agreements may not prevent a strike or work stoppage at our facilities in the future. We may also be subject to general country strikes or work stoppages unrelated to our business or collective bargaining agreements. A work stoppage or other limitations on production at our facilities for any reason could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. In addition, many of our customers and suppliers have unionized work forces. Strikes or work stoppages experienced by our customers or suppliers could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.  Costs associated with lawsuits or investigations or adverse rulings in enforcement or other legal proceedings may have an adverse effect on our results of operations.  We are subject to a variety of legal proceedings and legal compliance risks in virtually every part of the world. We face an inherent business risk of exposure to various types of claims, lawsuits and government investigations. We are involved in various intellectual property, product liability, product warranty and environmental claims and lawsuits and other legal proceedings that arise in and outside of the ordinary course of our business. The industries in which we operate are also periodically reviewed or investigated by regulators, which could lead to enforcement actions, fines and penalties or the assertion of private litigation claims. It is not possible to predict with certainty the outcome of claims, investigations and lawsuits, and we could in the future incur judgments, fines or penalties or enter into settlements of lawsuits and claims that could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition in any particular period.  The global and diverse nature of our operations means that legal and compliance risks will continue to exist and additional legal proceedings and other contingencies, the outcome of which cannot be predicted with certainty, will arise from time to time. In addition, subsequent developments in legal proceedings may affect our assessment and estimates of loss contingencies recorded as a reserve and require us to make payments in excess of our reserves, which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations.  Changes in accounting guidance could have an adverse effect on our results of operations, as reported in our financial statements.  Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with GAAP, which is periodically revised and/or expanded. Accordingly, from time to time we are required to adopt new or revised accounting guidance and related interpretations issued by recognized authoritative bodies, including the Financial Accounting Standards Board and the SEC. The impact of accounting pronouncements that have been issued but not yet implemented is disclosed in this annual report on Form 10-K and our quarterly reports on Form 10-Q. An assessment of proposed standards is not provided, as such proposals are subject to change through the exposure process and, therefore, their effects on our financial statements cannot be meaningfully assessed. It is possible that future accounting guidance we are required to adopt could change the current accounting treatment that we apply to our consolidated financial statements and that such changes could have an adverse effect on our results of operations, as reported in our consolidated financial statements.  Increased information technology security threats and more sophisticated computer crime pose a risk to our systems, networks, products and services. We rely upon information technology systems and networks, some of which are managed by third parties, in connection with a variety of business activities. Additionally, we collect and store data that is sensitive to Caterpillar. Operating these information technology systems and networks and processing and maintaining this data, in a secure manner, are critical to our business operations and strategy. Information technology security threats -- from user error to cybersecurity attacks designed to gain unauthorized access to our systems, networks and data -- are increasing in frequency and sophistication. Cybersecurity attacks may range from random attempts to coordinated and targeted attacks, including sophisticated computer crime and advanced threats. These threats pose a risk to the security of our systems and networks and the confidentiality, availability and integrity of our data. We have experienced cybersecurity attacks that have resulted in unauthorized parties gaining access to our information technology systems and networks, and we could in the future experience similar attacks. However, to date, no cybersecurity attack has had a material impact on our financial condition, results of operations or liquidity. While we actively manage information technology security risks within our control, there can be no assurance that such actions will be sufficient to mitigate all potential risks to our systems, networks and data. The potential consequences of a material cybersecurity attack include reputational damage, litigation with third parties, diminution in the value of our investment in research, development and engineering, and increased cybersecurity protection and remediation costs, which in turn could adversely affect our competitiveness and results of operations.  Unexpected events, including natural disasters, may increase our cost of doing business or disrupt our operations.  The occurrence of one or more unexpected events, including war, terrorist acts, fires, tornadoes, tsunamis, hurricanes, earthquakes, floods and other forms of severe weather in the United States or in other countries in which we operate or in which our suppliers are located could adversely affect our operations and financial performance. Natural disasters, pandemic illness, equipment failures, power outages or other unexpected events could result in physical damage to and complete or partial closure of one or more of our manufacturing facilities or distribution centers, temporary or long-term disruption in the supply of component products from some local and international suppliers, disruption in the transport of our products to dealers and end-users and delay in the delivery of our products to our distribution centers. Existing insurance arrangements may not provide protection for all of the costs that may arise from such events. ##TABLE_START ", "1B": " Item 1B.

Legal Proceedings. ##TABLE_END  On January 8, 2015, the Company received a grand jury subpoena from the U.S. District Court for the Central District of Illinois. The subpoena requests documents and information from the Company relating to, among other things, financial information concerning U.S. and non-U.S. Caterpillar subsidiaries (including undistributed profits of non-U.S. subsidiaries and the movement of cash among U.S. and non-U.S. subsidiaries). The Company is cooperating with this investigation. The Company is unable to predict the outcome or reasonably estimate any potential loss; however, we currently believe that this matter will not have a material adverse effect on the Companys consolidated results of operations, financial position or liquidity. On September 12, 2014, the SEC notified the Company that it was conducting an informal investigation relating to Caterpillar SARL and related structures. The SEC asked the Company to preserve relevant documents and, on a voluntary basis, the Company made a presentation to the staff of the SEC on these topics. The Company is cooperating with the SEC regarding this investigation. The Company is unable to predict the outcome or reasonably estimate any potential loss; however, we currently believe that this matter will not have a material adverse effect on the Companys consolidated results of operations, financial position or liquidity. On September 10, 2014, the SEC issued to Caterpillar a subpoena seeking information concerning the Companys accounting for the goodwill relating to its acquisition of Bucyrus International, Inc. in 2011 and related matters. The Company is cooperating with the SEC regarding this subpoena and its ongoing investigation. The Company is unable to predict the outcome or reasonably estimate any potential loss; however, we currently believe that this matter will not have a material adverse effect on the Company's consolidated results of operations, financial position or liquidity. On March 20, 2014, Brazils Administrative Council for Economic Defense (CADE) published a Technical Opinion which named 18 companies and over 100 individuals as defendants, including two subsidiaries of Caterpillar Inc., MGE - Equipamentos e Servios Ferrovirios Ltda. (MGE) and Caterpillar Brasil Ltda. The publication of the Technical Opinion opened CADE's official administrative investigation into allegations that the defendants participated in anticompetitive bid activity for the construction and maintenance of metro and train networks in Brazil. While companies cannot be held criminally liable for anticompetitive conduct in Brazil, criminal charges have been brought against two current employees of MGE and one former employee of MGE involving the same conduct alleged by CADE. The Company has responded to all requests for information from the authorities. The Company is unable to predict the outcome or reasonably estimate the potential loss; however, we currently believe that this matter will not have a material adverse effect on the Company's consolidated results of operations, financial position or liquidity. On February 19, 2014, Progress Rail Services Corporation (Progress Rail), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Caterpillar Inc., received information from the California Air Resources Board (CARB) Enforcement Division indicating it was contemplating an enforcement proceeding with potential monetary sanctions in excess of $100,000 in connection with a notice of violation received by Progress Rail on March 15, 2013 alleging violations of air emissions regulations applicable to compression ignition mobile cargo handling equipment operating at California ports or intermodal rail yards. Despite uncertainty regarding the applicability of these regulations, Progress Rail, in coordination with CARB, implemented certain corrective action measures. On November 26, 2014, Progress Rail settled this matter with CARB and paid a civil penalty of $390,733 to resolve the alleged violations. On October 24, 2013, Progress Rail received a grand jury subpoena from the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California. The subpoena requests documents and information from Progress Rail, United Industries Corporation, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Progress Rail, and Caterpillar Inc. relating to allegations that Progress Rail conducted improper or unnecessary railcar inspections and repairs and improperly disposed of parts, equipment, tools and other items. In connection with this subpoena, Progress Rail was informed by the U.S. Attorney for the Central District of California that it is a target of a criminal investigation into potential violations of environmental laws and alleged improper business practices. The Company is cooperating with the authorities and is currently in discussions regarding a potential resolution of the matter. Although the Company believes a loss is probable, we currently believe that this matter will not have a material adverse effect on the Company's consolidated results of operations, financial position or liquidity. In addition, we are involved in other unresolved legal actions that arise in the normal course of business. The most prevalent of these unresolved actions involve disputes related to product design, manufacture and performance liability (including claimed asbestos and welding fumes exposure), contracts, employment issues, environmental matters or intellectual property rights. The aggregate range of reasonably possible losses in excess of accrued liabilities, if any, associated with these unresolved legal actions is not material. In some cases, we cannot reasonably estimate a range of loss because there is insufficient information regarding the matter. However, there is no more than a remote chance that any liability arising from these matters would be material. Although it is not possible to predict with certainty the outcome of these unresolved legal actions, we believe that these actions will not individually or in the aggregate have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations, financial position or liquidity.  ##TABLE_START ", "4": " Item 4.

Managements Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting The management of Caterpillar Inc. (company) is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act. Our internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of our financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Our internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.  Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.  Management assessed the effectiveness of the companys internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2014 . In making this assessment, we used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework (2013). Based on our assessment we concluded that, as of December 31, 2014 , the companys internal control over financial reporting was effective based on those criteria. The effectiveness of the companys internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2014 has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm. Their report appears on page A-4 of Exhibit 13. Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting  During the last fiscal quarter, there has been no significant change in the companys internal control over financial reporting that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the companys internal control over financial reporting. ##TABLE_START ", "9B": " Item 9B.

Business. ##TABLE_END General  Originally organized as Caterpillar Tractor Co. in 1925 in the State of California, our company was reorganized as Caterpillar Inc. in 1986 in the State of Delaware. As used herein, the term Caterpillar, we, us, our or the company refers to Caterpillar Inc. and its subsidiaries unless designated or identified otherwise.  Overview  With 2015 sales and revenues of $47.011 billion , Caterpillar is the worlds leading manufacturer of construction and mining equipment, diesel and natural gas engines, industrial gas turbines and diesel-electric locomotives. The company principally operates through its three product segments - Construction Industries, Resource Industries and Energy  Transportation - and also provides financing and related services through its Financial Products segment. Caterpillar is also a leading U.S. exporter. Through a global network of independent dealers and direct sales of certain products, Caterpillar builds long-term relationships with customers around the world.  Currently, we have seven operating segments, of which four are reportable segments and are described below. Further information about our reportable segments, including geographic information, appears in Note 23  Segment information of Part II, Item 8 \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\"  Categories of Business Organization  1.   Machinery, Energy  Transportation  Represents the aggregate total of Construction Industries, Resource Industries, Energy  Transportation and All Other operating segments and related corporate items and eliminations.  2.   Financial Products  Primarily includes the companys Financial Products Segment. This category includes Caterpillar Financial Services Corporation (Cat Financial), Caterpillar Financial Insurance Services (Insurance Services) and their respective subsidiaries.  Other information about our operations in 2015 , including certain risks associated with our operations, is included in Part II, Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.  Construction Industries  Our Construction Industries segment is primarily responsible for supporting customers using machinery in infrastructure and building construction applications. The majority of machine sales in this segment are made in the heavy and general construction, rental, quarry and aggregates markets and mining.  Customer demand for construction machinery has generally been characterized over the past decade by a shift from developed to developing economies. Customers in developing economies often prioritize purchase price in making their investment decisions, while customers in developed economies generally weigh productivity and other performance criteria that contribute to lower lifetime owning and operating costs of a machine. To meet customer expectations in developing economies, Caterpillar developed differentiated product offerings that target customers in those markets, including our SEM brand machines. We believe that these customer-driven product innovations enable us to compete more effectively in developing economies. In those developed economies that are subject to diesel engine emission requirements, we continued our multi-year roll out of products designed to meet those requirements. The majority of Construction Industries' research and development spending in 2015 focused on the next generation of construction machines.  The competitive environment for construction machinery is characterized by some global competitors and many regional and specialized local competitors. Examples of global competitors include Komatsu Ltd., Volvo Construction Equipment (part of the Volvo Group), CNH Industrial N.V., Deere  Company, Hitachi Construction Machinery Co., Ltd., J.C. Bamford Excavators Ltd., Doosan Infracore Co. Ltd., and Hyundai Construction Equipment (part of Hyundai Heavy Industries). As an example of regional and local competitors, our competitors in China also include Guangxi LiuGong Machinery Co., Ltd., Longking Holdings Ltd., Sany Heavy Industry Co., Ltd., Xiamen XGMA Machinery Co., Ltd., XCMG Group, The Shandong Heavy Industry Group Co., Ltd. (Shantui Construction Machinery Co., Ltd.), Strong Construction Machinery Co., Ltd., and Shandong Lingong Construction Machinery Co., Ltd. (part of Volvo Group). Each of these companies has varying product lines that compete with Caterpillar products, and each has varying degrees of regional focus.  The Construction Industries product portfolio includes the following machines and related parts:  ##TABLE_START    backhoe loaders    compact wheel loaders    small track-type tractors   small wheel loaders    track-type loaders   medium track-type tractors   skid steer loaders    mini excavators    select work tools   multi-terrain loaders    small, medium and large track excavators    motor graders  medium wheel loaders    wheel excavators    telehandlers  compact track loaders   pipelayers    mid-tier soil compactors ##TABLE_ENDResource Industries  The Resource Industries segment is primarily responsible for supporting customers using machinery in mine and quarry applications. Caterpillar offers mining customers the broadest product range in the industry. We manufacture high productivity equipment for both surface and underground mining operations around the world. Our equipment is used to extract and haul copper, iron ore, coal, oil sands, aggregates, gold and other minerals and ores. In addition to equipment, Resource Industries also develops and sells technology to provide customers fleet management systems, equipment management analytics and autonomous machine capabilities. Customers in most markets place an emphasis on equipment that is highly productive, reliable and provides the lowest total cost of ownership over the life of the equipment. In some developing markets, customers often prioritize purchase price in making their investment decisions. We believe our ability to control the integration and design of key machine components represents a competitive advantage. Our research and development efforts remain focused on providing mining and quarry customers the lowest total cost of ownership enabled through the highest quality, most productive products in the industry. The competitive environment for Resource Industries consists of a few larger global competitors that compete in several of the markets that we serve and a substantial number of smaller companies that compete in a more limited range of products, applications, and regional markets. Our global surface competitors include Komatsu Ltd., Joy Global, Inc., Hitachi Construction Machinery Co., Ltd., Volvo Construction Equipment, Atlas Copco AB, and Sandvik Mining. Our global underground competitors include Joy Global, Inc., Atlas Copco AB, Sandvik Mining and Zhengzhou Coal Mining Machinery Group Co., Ltd. The Resource Industries product portfolio includes the following machines and related parts:  ##TABLE_START   electric rope shovels    large track-type tractors    wheel tractor scrapers   draglines    large mining trucks    wheel dozers   hydraulic shovels    longwall miners    machinery components   track and rotary drills    large wheel loaders    electronics and control systems   highwall miners    off-highway trucks    select work tools   hard rock vehicles    articulated trucks    hard rock continuous mining systems   continuous miners    scoops and haulers   ##TABLE_END Energy  Transportation  Our Energy  Transportation segment supports customers in oil and gas, power generation, marine, rail and industrial applications, including Cat machines. The product and services portfolio includes reciprocating engines, generator sets, marine propulsion systems, gas turbines and turbine-related services, diesel-electric locomotives and other rail-related products and services.  Regulatory emissions standards of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and comparable standards in other developed economies have required us to make significant investments in research and development that will continue as new products and similar regulations are introduced over the next several years. We believe that our emissions technology provides a competitive advantage in connection with emissions standards compliance and performance.  The competitive environment for reciprocating engines in marine, oil and gas, industrial and electric power generation systems along with turbines consists of a few larger global competitors that compete in a variety of markets that Caterpillar serves, and a substantial number of smaller companies that compete in a limited-size product range, geographic region and/or application. Principal global competitors include Cummins Inc., Rolls-Royce Power System, GE Oil  Gas, GE Power  Water, Deutz AG and Wrtsil Corp. Other competitors, such as MAN Diesel  Turbo SE, Siemens Energy, Rolls-Royce Marine, Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Ltd., Volvo Penta, Weichai Power Co., Ltd., Kirloskar Oil Engines Limited and other emerging market competitors compete in certain markets in which Caterpillar competes. An additional set of competitors, including Generac Power Systems, Inc., Kohler Co., Inc., Aggreko plc and others, are packagers who source engines and/or other components from domestic and international suppliers and market products regionally and internationally through a variety of distribution channels. In rail-related businesses, our global competitors include GE Transportation, Vossloh AG, Siemens Akteingesellschaft, Alstom Transport SA, and Voestalpine AG. We also compete with other companies on a more limited range of products, services and/or geographic regions. The Energy  Transportation portfolio includes the following products and related parts: ##TABLE_START  reciprocating engine powered generator sets ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  reciprocating engines supplied to the industrial industry as well as Caterpillar machinery ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  integrated systems used in the electric power generation industry ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  turbines, centrifugal gas compressors and related services ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  reciprocating engines and integrated systems and solutions for the marine and oil and gas industries ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  diesel-electric locomotives and components and other rail-related products and services ##TABLE_END Financial Products Segment  The business of our Financial Products segment is primarily conducted by Cat Financial, a wholly owned finance subsidiary of Caterpillar. Cat Financials primary business is to provide retail and wholesale financing alternatives for Caterpillar products to customers and dealers around the world. Retail financing is primarily comprised of the financing of Caterpillar equipment, machinery and engines. Cat Financial also provides financing for vehicles, power generation facilities and marine vessels that, in most cases, incorporate Caterpillar products. In addition to retail financing, Cat Financial provides wholesale financing to Caterpillar dealers and purchases short-term trade receivables from Caterpillar and its subsidiaries. The various financing plans offered by Cat Financial are primarily designed to increase the opportunity for sales of Caterpillar products and generate financing income for Cat Financial. A significant portion of Cat Financials activities is conducted in North America. Cat Financial also has offices and subsidiaries in Asia/Pacific, Europe and Latin America.  For over 30 years, Cat Financial has been providing financing in the various markets in which it participates, contributing to its knowledge of asset values, industry trends, product structuring and customer needs.  In certain instances, Cat Financials operations are subject to supervision and regulation by state, federal and various foreign governmental authorities, and may be subject to various laws and judicial and administrative decisions imposing various requirements and restrictions which, among other things, (i) regulate credit granting activities and the administration of loans, (ii) establish maximum interest rates, finance charges and other charges, (iii) require disclosures to customers and investors, (iv) govern secured transactions, (v) set collection, foreclosure, repossession and other trade practices and (vi) regulate the use and reporting of information related to a borrowers credit experience. Cat Financials ability to comply with these and other governmental and legal requirements and restrictions affects its operations. Cat Financials retail leases and installment sale contracts (totaling 53 percent*) include:  ##TABLE_START  Tax leases that are classified as either operating or finance leases for financial accounting purposes, depending on the characteristics of the lease. For tax purposes, Cat Financial is considered the owner of the equipment (14 percent*). ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  Finance (non-tax) leases, where the lessee for tax purposes is considered to be the owner of the equipment during the term of the lease, that either require or allow the customer to purchase the equipment for a fixed price at the end of the term (17 percent*). ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  Installment sale contracts, which are equipment loans that enable customers to purchase equipment with a down payment or trade-in and structure payments over time (21 percent*). ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  Governmental lease-purchase plans in the U.S. that offer low interest rates and flexible terms to qualified non-federal government agencies (1 percent*). ##TABLE_END  Cat Financials wholesale notes receivable, finance leases and installment sale contracts (totaling 13 percent*) include:  ##TABLE_START  Inventory/rental programs, which provide assistance to dealers by financing their new Caterpillar inventory and rental fleets (5 percent*). ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  Short-term trade receivables Cat Financial purchased from Caterpillar at a discount (8 percent*). ##TABLE_END  Cat Financials retail notes receivables (34 percent*) include:  ##TABLE_START  Loans that allow customers and dealers to use their Caterpillar equipment or other assets as collateral to obtain financing. ##TABLE_END *Indicates the percentage of Cat Financials total portfolio at December 31, 2015. We define total portfolio as total finance receivables (net of unearned income and allowance for credit losses) plus equipment on operating leases, less accumulated depreciation. For more information on the above and Cat Financials concentration of credit risk, please refer to Note 6  Cat Financial Financing Activities of Part II, Item 8 \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\" _____________________________  Cat Financial operates in a highly competitive environment, with financing for users of Caterpillar equipment available through a variety of sources, principally commercial banks and finance and leasing companies. Cat Financials competitors include Wells Fargo Equipment Finance Inc., General Electric Capital Corporation and various other banks and finance companies. In addition, many of our manufacturing competitors own financial subsidiaries such as Volvo Financial Services, Komatsu Financial L.P. and John Deere Capital Corporation that utilize below-market interest rate programs (funded by the manufacturer) to assist machine sales. Caterpillar and Cat Financial work together to provide a broad array of financial merchandising programs around the world to meet these competitive offers.  Cat Financials financial results are largely dependent upon the ability of Caterpillar dealers to sell equipment and customers willingness to enter into financing or leasing agreements. It is also affected by, among other things, the availability of funds from its financing sources, general economic conditions such as inflation and market interest rates and its cost of funds relative to its competitors.  Cat Financial has a match-funding policy that addresses interest rate risk by aligning the interest rate profile (fixed or floating rate) of its debt portfolio with the interest rate profile of its receivables portfolio within predetermined ranges on an ongoing basis. In connection with that policy, Cat Financial uses interest rate derivative instruments to modify the debt structure to match assets within the receivables portfolio. This matched funding reduces the volatility of margins between interest-bearing assets and interest-bearing liabilities, regardless of which direction interest rates move. For more information regarding match funding, please see Note 3  Derivative financial instruments and risk management of Part II, Item 8 \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\" See also the risk factors on pages 9 through 18 for general risks associated with our financial products business included in Item 1A. of this Form 10-K. In managing foreign currency risk for Cat Financials operations, the objective is to minimize earnings volatility resulting from conversion and the remeasurement of net foreign currency balance sheet positions, and future transactions denominated in foreign currencies. This policy allows the use of foreign currency forward, option and cross currency contracts to offset the risk of currency mismatch between the receivable and debt portfolios, and exchange rate risk associated with future transactions denominated in foreign currencies.  Cat Financial provides financing only when certain criteria are met. Credit decisions are based on a variety of credit quality factors including prior payment experience, customer financial information, credit-rating agency ratings, loan-to-value ratios and other internal metrics. Cat Financial typically maintains a security interest in retail-financed equipment and requires physical damage insurance coverage on financed equipment. Cat Financial finances a significant portion of Caterpillar dealers sales and inventory of Caterpillar equipment throughout the world. Cat Financials competitive position is improved by marketing programs offered in conjunction with Caterpillar and/or Caterpillar dealers. Under these programs, Caterpillar, or the dealer, funds an amount at the outset of the transaction, which Cat Financial then recognizes as revenue over the term of the financing. We believe that these marketing programs provide Cat Financial a significant competitive advantage in financing Caterpillar products.

In all markets, we compete on the basis of product performance, customer service, quality and price. From time to time, the intensity of competition results in price discounting in a particular industry or region. Such price discounting puts pressure on margins and can negatively impact operating profit. Outside the United States, certain of our competitors enjoy competitive advantages inherent to operating in their home countries or regions.  Raw Materials and Component Products  We source our raw materials and manufactured components from suppliers both domestically and internationally. These purchases include unformed materials and rough and finished parts. Unformed materials include a variety of steel products, which are then cut or formed to shape and machined in our facilities. Rough parts include various sized steel and iron castings and forgings, which are machined to final specification levels inside our facilities. Finished parts are ready to assemble components, which are made either to Caterpillar specifications or to the supplier developed specifications. We machine and assemble some of the components used in our machines, engines and power generation units and to support our after-market dealer parts sales. We also purchase various goods and services used in production, logistics, offices and product development processes. We maintain global strategic sourcing models to meet our global facilities production needs while building long-term supplier relationships and leveraging enterprise spend. We expect our suppliers to maintain, at all times, industry-leading levels of quality and the ability to timely deliver raw materials and component products for our machine and engine products. We use a variety of agreements with suppliers to protect our intellectual property and processes to monitor and mitigate risks of the supply base causing a business disruption. The risks monitored include supplier financial viability, the ability to increase or decrease production levels, business continuity, quality and delivery.  Patents and Trademarks  Our products are sold primarily under the brands Caterpillar, CAT, design versions of CAT and Caterpillar, Electro-Motive, FG Wilson, MaK, MWM, Perkins, Progress Rail, SEM and Solar Turbines. We own a number of patents and trademarks, which have been obtained over a period of years and relate to the products we manufacture and the services we provide. These patents and trademarks have been of value in the growth of our business and may continue to be of value in the future. We do not regard our business as being dependent upon any single patent or group of patents. Order Backlog  The dollar amount of backlog believed to be firm was approximately $13.0 billion at December 31, 2015 and $17.3 billion at December 31, 2014 . Compared to year-end 2014 , the order backlog declined about $4.3 billion. The decrease was split about evenly across Construction Industries, Energy  Transportation and Resource Industries. Of the total backlog at December 31, 2015 , approximately $4.0 billion was not expected to be filled in 2016. Dealers and Distributors  Our machines are distributed principally through a worldwide organization of dealers (dealer network), 48 located in the United States and 127 located outside the United States, serving 182 countries and operating 3,593 places of business, including 1,274 dealer rental outlets. Reciprocating engines are sold principally through the dealer network and to other manufacturers for use in products. Some of the reciprocating engines manufactured by our subsidiary Perkins Engines Company Limited, are also sold through its worldwide network of 97 distributors covering 180 countries. The FG Wilson branded electric power generation systems manufactured by our subsidiary Caterpillar Northern Ireland Limited are sold through its worldwide network of 290 distributors located in 145 countries. Some of the large, medium speed reciprocating engines are also sold under the MaK brand through a worldwide network of 19 distributors located in 130 countries.  Our dealers do not deal exclusively with our products; however, in most cases sales and servicing of our products are the dealers principal business. Some products, primarily turbines and locomotives, are sold directly to end customers through sales forces employed by the company. At times, these employees are assisted by independent sales representatives. While the large majority of our worldwide dealers are independently owned and operated, we own and operate a dealership in Japan that covers approximately 85% of the Japanese market: Nippon Caterpillar Division. We are currently operating this Japanese dealer directly and its results are reported in the All Other operating segments. There are also three independent dealers in the Southern Region of Japan.  For Caterpillar branded products, the companys relationship with each of its independent dealers is memorialized in standard sales and service agreements. Pursuant to this agreement, the company grants the dealer the right to purchase and sell its products and to service the products in a specified geographic service territory. Prices to dealers are established by the company after receiving input from dealers on transactional pricing in the marketplace. The company also agrees to defend its intellectual property and to provide warranty and technical support to the dealer. The agreement further grants the dealer a non-exclusive license to use the companys trademarks, service marks and brand names. In some instances, a separate trademark agreement exists between the company and a dealer.  In exchange for these rights, the agreement obligates the dealer to develop and promote the sale of the companys products to current and prospective customers in the dealers service territory. Each dealer agrees to employ adequate sales and support personnel to market, sell and promote the companys products, demonstrate and exhibit the products, perform the companys product improvement programs, inform the company concerning any features that might affect the safe operation of any of the companys products and maintain detailed books and records of the dealers financial condition, sales and inventories and make these books and records available at the companys reasonable request.  These sales and service agreements are terminable at will by either party primarily upon 90 days written notice and provide for termination automatically if the dealer files for bankruptcy protection or upon the occurrence of comparable action seeking protection from creditors.  Research and Development  We have always placed strong emphasis on product-oriented research and development relating to the development of new or improved machines, engines and major components. In 2015 , 2014 and 2013 , we spent $2,165 million, $2,135 million and $2,046 million, or 4.6, 3.9 and 3.7 percent of our sales and revenues, respectively, on our research and development programs.  Employment  As of December 31, 2015 , we employed about 105,700 full-time persons of whom approximately 58,000 were located outside the United States. In the United States, we employed approximately 47,700 employees, most of whom are at-will employees and, therefore, not subject to any type of employment contract or agreement. Full-time employment at the end of 2015 includes approximately 2,100 employees who participated in the U.S. voluntary retirement enhancement program in the U.S. and left the company January 1, 2016. At select business units, certain highly specialized employees have been hired under employment contracts that specify a term of employment and specify pay and other benefits.  ##TABLE_START Full-Time Employees at Year-End      Inside U.S. 47,700  50,800 Outside U.S. 58,000  63,400 Total 105,700  114,200     By Region:    North America 48,000  51,200 EAME 21,300  23,200 Latin America 12,300  14,400 Asia/Pacific 24,100  25,400 Total 105,700  114,200     ##TABLE_ENDAs of December 31, 2015 , there were approximately 8,200 U.S. hourly production employees who were covered by collective bargaining agreements with various labor unions, including The United Automobile, Aerospace and Agricultural Implement Workers of America (UAW), The International Association of Machinists and The United Steelworkers. Approximately 6,100 of such employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements with the UAW that expire on March 1, 2017 and December 17, 2018. Outside the United States, the company enters into employment contracts and agreements in those countries in which such relationships are mandatory or customary. The provisions of these agreements generally correspond in each case with the required or customary terms in the subject jurisdiction.  Sales and Revenues  Sales and revenues outside the United States were 59 percent of consolidated sales and revenues for 2015 , 62 percent for 2014 and 67 percent for 2013 . Environmental Matters  The company is regulated by federal, state and international environmental laws governing our use, transport and disposal of substances and control of emissions. In addition to governing our manufacturing and other operations, these laws often impact the development of our products, including, but not limited to, required compliance with air emissions standards applicable to internal combustion engines. We have made, and will continue to make, significant research and development and capital expenditures to comply with these emissions standards.  We are engaged in remedial activities at a number of locations, often with other companies, pursuant to federal and state laws. When it is probable we will pay remedial costs at a site, and those costs can be reasonably estimated, the investigation, remediation, and operating and maintenance costs are accrued against our earnings. Costs are accrued based on consideration of currently available data and information with respect to each individual site, including available technologies, current applicable laws and regulations, and prior remediation experience. Where no amount within a range of estimates is more likely, we accrue the minimum. Where multiple potentially responsible parties are involved, we consider our proportionate share of the probable costs. In formulating the estimate of probable costs, we do not consider amounts expected to be recovered from insurance companies or others. We reassess these accrued amounts on a quarterly basis. The amount recorded for environmental remediation is not material and is included in the line item \"Accrued expenses\" in Statement 3  \"Consolidated Financial Position at December 31\" of Part II, Item 8 \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\" There is no more than a remote chance that a material amount for remedial activities at any individual site, or at all the sites in the aggregate, will be required.

Risk Factors. ##TABLE_END  The statements in this section describe the most significant risks to our business and should be considered carefully in conjunction with Part II, Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements of Part II, Item 8 \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\" to this Form 10-K. In addition, the statements in this section and other sections of this Form 10-K, including in Part II, Item 7 \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\" include forward-looking statements as that term is defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and involve uncertainties that could significantly impact results. Forward-looking statements give current expectations or forecasts of future events about the company or our outlook. You can identify forward-looking statements by the fact they do not relate to historical or current facts and by the use of words such as believe, expect, estimate, anticipate, will be, should, plan, project, intend, could and similar words or expressions.  Forward-looking statements are based on assumptions and on known risks and uncertainties. Although we believe we have been prudent in our assumptions, any or all of our forward-looking statements may prove to be inaccurate, and we can make no guarantees about our future performance. Should known or unknown risks or uncertainties materialize or underlying assumptions prove inaccurate, actual results could materially differ from past results and/or those anticipated, estimated or projected. We undertake no obligation to publicly update forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. You should, however, consult any subsequent disclosures we make in our filings with the SEC on Form 10-Q or Form 8-K.  The following is a cautionary discussion of risks, uncertainties and assumptions that we believe are significant to our business. In addition to the factors discussed elsewhere in this report, the following are some of the important factors that, individually or in the aggregate, we believe could make our actual results differ materially from those described in any forward-looking statements. It is impossible to predict or identify all such factors and, as a result, you should not consider the following factors to be a complete discussion of risks, uncertainties and assumptions.  Our business is highly sensitive to global and regional economic conditions and economic conditions in the industries we serve.  Our results of operations are materially affected by economic conditions globally and regionally and in the particular industries we serve. The demand for our products and services tends to be cyclical and can be significantly reduced in an economic environment characterized by lower levels of government and business investment, lower levels of business confidence, lower corporate earnings, perceived or actual industry overcapacity, higher unemployment and lower consumer spending. A prolonged period of slow growth may also reduce demand for our products and services. Economic conditions vary across regions and countries, and demand for our products and services generally increases in those regions and countries experiencing economic growth and investment. A change in the global mix of regions and countries experiencing economic growth and investment could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.  The energy and mining industries are major users of our products, including the coal, iron ore, gold, copper, oil and natural gas industries. Decisions to purchase our products are dependent upon the performance of these industries, which in turn are dependent in part on commodity prices. Prices of commodities in these industries are frequently volatile and can change abruptly and unpredictibly in response to general economic conditions, economic growth, government actions, regulatory actions, commodity inventories, production levels, market expectations and any disruptions in production or distribution. We assume certain prices for key commodities in preparing our general economic and financial outlooks (outlooks). Commodity prices lower than those assumed in our outlooks may negatively impact our business, results of operations and financial condition. Economic conditions affecting the industries we serve may in the future also lead to reduced capital expenditures by our customers. Reduced capital expenditures by our customers are likely to lead to a decrease in the demand for our products and may also result in a decrease in demand for aftermarket parts as customers are likely to extend preventative maintenance schedules and delay major overhauls when possible.  The rates of infrastructure spending, housing starts and commercial construction also play a significant role in our results. Our products are an integral component of these activities, and as these activities decrease, demand for our products may be significantly impacted, which could negatively impact our results. Slower rates of economic growth than anticipated in our outlooks could also adversely impact our business, results of operations and financial condition.  Changes in government monetary or fiscal policies may negatively impact our results .  Most countries where our products and services are sold have established central banks to regulate monetary systems and influence economic activities, generally by adjusting interest rates. Interest rate changes affect overall economic growth, which affects demand for residential and nonresidential structures, as well as energy and mined products, which in turn affects sales of our products and services that serve these activities. Interest rate changes also affect our customers ability to finance machine purchases, can change the optimal time to keep machines in a fleet and can impact the ability of our suppliers to finance the production of parts and components necessary to manufacture and support our products. Our outlooks typically include assumptions about interest rates in a number of countries. Increases in interest rates could negatively impact sales and create supply chain inefficiencies.  Central banks and other policy arms of many countries take actions to vary the amount of liquidity and credit available in an economy. Liquidity and credit policies different from those assumed in our outlooks could impact the customers and markets we serve or our suppliers, which could adversely impact our business, results of operations and financial condition. Changes in monetary and fiscal policies, along with other factors, may cause currency exchange rates to fluctuate. Actions that lead the currency exchange rate of a country where we manufacture products to increase relative to other currencies could reduce the competitiveness of products made in that country, which could adversely affect our competitive position, results of operations and financial condition. Government policies on taxes and spending also affect our business. Throughout the world, government spending finances a significant portion of infrastructure development, such as highways, airports, sewer and water systems and dams. Tax regulations determine depreciation lives and the amount of money users of our products can retain, both of which influence investment decisions. Unfavorable developments, such as declines in government revenues, decisions to reduce public spending or increases in taxes, could negatively impact our results.  Commodity price changes, component price increases, fluctuations in demand for our products or significant shortages of component products may adversely impact our financial results or our ability to meet commitments to customers.  We are a significant user of steel and many other commodities required for the manufacture of our products. Unanticipated increases in the prices of such commodities would increase our costs, negatively impacting our business, results of operations and financial condition if we are unable to fully offset the effect of these increased costs through price increases, productivity improvements or cost reduction programs.  We rely on suppliers to secure component products, particularly steel, required for the manufacture of our products. A disruption in deliveries to or from suppliers or decreased availability of components or commodities could have an adverse effect on our ability to meet our commitments to customers or increase our operating costs. On the other hand, if demand for our products is less than we expect, we may experience excess inventories and be forced to incur additional charges and our profitability may suffer. Our business, competitive position, results of operations or financial condition could be negatively impacted if supply is insufficient for our operations, if we experience excess inventories or if we are unable to adjust our production schedules or our purchases from suppliers to reflect changes in customer demand and market fluctuations on a timely basis.  Disruptions or volatility in global financial markets could limit our sources of liquidity, or the liquidity of our customers, dealers and suppliers.  Global economic conditions may cause volatility and disruptions in the capital and credit markets. Although we have generated funds from our operations to pay our operating expenses, fund our capital expenditures and support growth, fund our employee retirement benefit programs, pay dividends and buy back stock, continuing to meet these cash requirements over the long-term requires substantial liquidity and access to varied sources of funds, including capital and credit markets. Changes in global economic conditions, including material cost increases and decreases in economic activity in the markets that we serve, and the success of plans to manage cost increases, inventory and other important elements of our business may significantly impact our ability to generate funds from operations. Market volatility, changes in counterparty credit risk, the impact of government intervention in financial markets and general economic conditions may also adversely impact our ability to access capital and credit markets to fund operating needs. Global or regional economic downturns could cause financial markets to decrease the availability of liquidity, credit and credit capacity for certain issuers, including certain of our customers, dealers and suppliers. An inability to access capital and credit markets may have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and competitive position.  In addition, demand for our products generally depends on customers ability to pay for our products, which, in turn, depends on their access to funds. Subject to global economic conditions, customers may experience increased difficulty in generating funds from operations. Capital and credit market volatility and uncertainty may cause financial institutions to revise their lending standards, resulting in decreased access to capital. If capital and credit market volatility occurs, customers liquidity may decline which, in turn, would reduce their ability to purchase our products. Our global operations are exposed to political and economic risks, commercial instability and events beyond our control in the countries in which we operate.  Our global operations are dependent upon products manufactured, purchased and sold in the U.S. and internationally, including in countries with political and economic instability. Some countries have greater political and economic volatility and greater vulnerability to infrastructure and labor disruptions than others. Our business could be negatively impacted by adverse fluctuations in freight costs, limitations on shipping and receiving capacity, and other disruptions in the transportation and shipping infrastructure at important geographic points of exit and entry for our products. Operating and seeking to expand business in a number of different regions and countries exposes us to a number of risks, including:  ##TABLE_START  multiple and potentially conflicting laws, regulations and policies that are subject to change; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  imposition of currency restrictions, restrictions on repatriation of earnings or other restraints; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  imposition of burdensome tariffs or quotas; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  imposition of new or additional trade and economic sanctions laws imposed by the U.S. or foreign governments; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  national and international conflict; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  war or terrorist acts; and ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  political and economic instability or civil unrest that may severely disrupt economic activity in affected countries. ##TABLE_END  The occurrence of one or more of these events may negatively impact our business, results of operations and financial condition.  Failure to maintain our credit ratings would increase our cost of borrowing and could adversely affect our cost of funds, liquidity, competitive position and access to capital markets.  Each of Caterpillars and Cat Financials costs of borrowing and ability to access the capital markets are affected not only by market conditions but also by the short- and long-term debt ratings assigned to their respective debt by the major credit rating agencies. These ratings are based, in significant part, on each of Caterpillars and Cat Financials performance as measured by financial metrics such as net worth and interest coverage and leverage ratios, as well as transparency with rating agencies and timeliness of financial reporting. There can be no assurance that Caterpillar or Cat Financial will be able to maintain their credit ratings and the failure of either Caterpillar or Cat Financial to do so could adversely affect our cost of funds, liquidity, competitive position and access to the capital markets, including restricting, in whole or in part, our access to the commercial paper market. There can be no assurance that the commercial paper market will continue to be a reliable source of short-term financing for Cat Financial or an available source of short-term financing for Caterpillar. An inability to access the capital markets could have an adverse effect on our cash flow, results of operations and financial condition.  Our Financial Products segment is subject to risks associated with the financial services industry.  Cat Financial is significant to our operations and provides financing support to a significant share of our global sales. The inability of Cat Financial to access funds to support its financing activities to our customers could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Continuing to meet Cat Financial's cash requirements over the long-term could require substantial liquidity and access to sources of funds, including capital and credit markets. Cat Financial has continued to maintain access to key global medium term note and commercial paper markets, but there can be no assurance that such markets will continue to represent a reliable source of financing. If global economic conditions were to deteriorate, Cat Financial could face materially higher financing costs, become unable to access adequate funding to operate and grow its business and/or meet its debt service obligations as they mature, and be required to draw upon contractually committed lending agreements and/or by seeking other funding sources. However, there can be no assurance that such agreements and other funding sources would be available or sufficient under extreme market conditions. Any of these events could negatively impact Cat Financials business, as well as our and Cat Financial's results of operations and financial condition.  Market disruption and volatility may also lead to a number of other risks in connection with these events, including but not limited to:  ##TABLE_START  Market developments that may affect customer confidence levels and cause declines in the demand for financing and adverse changes in payment patterns, causing increases in delinquencies and default rates, which could impact Cat Financials write-offs and provision for credit losses. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  The process Cat Financial uses to estimate losses inherent in its credit exposure requires a high degree of managements judgment regarding numerous subjective qualitative factors, including forecasts of economic conditions and how economic predictors might impair the ability of its borrowers to repay their loans. Financial market disruption and volatility may impact the accuracy of these judgments. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  Cat Financials ability to engage in routine funding transactions or borrow from other financial institutions on acceptable terms or at all could be adversely affected by disruptions in the capital markets or other events, including actions by rating agencies and deteriorating investor expectations. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  As Cat Financials counterparties are primarily financial institutions, their ability to perform in accordance with any of its underlying agreements could be adversely affected by market volatility and/or disruptions in financial markets. ##TABLE_END Changes in interest rates or market liquidity conditions could adversely affect Cat Financial's and our earnings and/or cash flow.  Changes in interest rates and market liquidity conditions could have an adverse effect on Cat Financial's and our earnings and cash flows. Because a significant number of the loans made by Cat Financial are made at fixed interest rates, its business is subject to fluctuations in interest rates. Changes in market interest rates may influence its financing costs, returns on financial investments and the valuation of derivative contracts and could reduce its and our earnings and cash flows. Although Cat Financial manages interest rate and market liquidity risks through a variety of techniques, including a match funding program, the selective use of derivatives and a broadly diversified funding program, there can be no assurance that fluctuations in interest rates and market liquidity conditions will not have an adverse effect on its and our earnings and cash flows. If any of the variety of instruments and strategies Cat Financial uses to hedge its exposure to these types of risk is ineffective, we may incur losses. With respect to Insurance Services' investment activities, changes in the equity and bond markets could cause an impairment of the value of its investment portfolio, requiring a negative adjustment to earnings. An increase in delinquencies, repossessions or net losses of Cat Financial customers could adversely affect its results.  Inherent in the operation of Cat Financial is the credit risk associated with its customers. The creditworthiness of each customer and the rate of delinquencies, repossessions and net losses on customer obligations are directly impacted by several factors, including relevant industry and economic conditions, the availability of capital, the experience and expertise of the customer's management team, commodity prices, political events and the sustained value of the underlying collateral. Any increase in delinquencies, repossessions and net losses on customer obligations could have a material adverse effect on Cat Financial's and our earnings and cash flows. In addition, although Cat Financial evaluates and adjusts its allowance for credit losses related to past due and non-performing receivables on a regular basis, adverse economic conditions or other factors that might cause deterioration of the financial health of its customers could change the timing and level of payments received and thus necessitate an increase in Cat Financial's estimated losses, which could also have a material adverse effect on Cat Financial's and our earnings and cash flows.  New regulations or changes in financial services regulation could adversely impact Caterpillar and Cat Financial.  Cat Financials operations are highly regulated by governmental authorities in the locations where it operates, which can impose significant additional costs and/or restrictions on its business. In the U.S., for example, certain of Cat Financials activities are subject to the U.S. Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Dodd-Frank), a comprehensive financial reform act signed into law in July 2010 that includes extensive provisions regulating the financial services industry. As such, Cat Financial has become and could continue to become subject to additional regulatory costs that could be significant  and have an adverse effect on Cat Financial's and our results of operations and financial condition. Additional regulations in the U.S. or internationally impacting the financial services industry could also add significant cost or operational constraints that might have an adverse effect on Cat Financial's and our results of operations and financial condition. We may not realize all of the anticipated benefits of our acquisitions, joint ventures or divestitures, or these benefits may take longer to realize than expected. In pursuing our business strategy, we routinely evaluate targets and enter into agreements regarding possible acquisitions, divestitures and joint ventures. We often compete with others for the same opportunities. To be successful, we conduct due diligence to identify valuation issues and potential loss contingencies, negotiate transaction terms, complete complex transactions and manage post-closing matters such as the integration of acquired businesses. Our due diligence reviews are subject to the completeness and accuracy of disclosures made by third parties. We may incur unanticipated costs or expenses following a completed acquisition, including post-closing asset impairment charges, expenses associated with eliminating duplicate facilities, litigation, and other liabilities. The risks associated with our past or future acquisitions also include the following:  ##TABLE_START  the business culture of the acquired business may not match well with our culture; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  technological and product synergies, economies of scale and cost reductions may not occur as expected; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  unforeseen expenses, delays or conditions may be imposed upon the acquisition, including due to required regulatory approvals or consents; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  we may acquire or assume unexpected liabilities or be subject to unexpected penalties or other enforcement actions; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  faulty assumptions may be made regarding the integration process; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  unforeseen difficulties may arise in integrating operations, processes and systems; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  higher than expected investments may be required to implement necessary compliance processes and related systems, including IT systems, accounting systems and internal controls over financial reporting; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  we may fail to retain, motivate and integrate key management and other employees of the acquired business; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  higher than expected costs may arise due to unforeseen changes in tax, trade, environmental, labor, safety, payroll or pension policies in any jurisdiction in which the acquired business conducts its operations; and ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  we may experience problems in retaining customers and integrating customer bases. ##TABLE_END Many of these factors will be outside of our control and any one of them could result in increased costs, decreases in the amount of expected revenues and diversion of managements time and attention. They may also delay the realization of the benefits we anticipate when we enter into a transaction.  In order to conserve cash for operations, we may undertake acquisitions financed in part through public offerings or private placements of debt or equity securities, or other arrangements. Such acquisition financing could result in a decrease in our earnings and adversely affect other leverage measures. If we issue equity securities or equity-linked securities, the issued securities may have a dilutive effect on the interests of the holders of our common shares.  Failure to implement our acquisition strategy, including successfully integrating acquired businesses, could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Furthermore, we make strategic divestitures from time to time. In the case of divestitures, we may agree to indemnify acquiring parties for certain liabilities arising from our former businesses. These divestitures may also result in continued financial involvement in the divested businesses, including through guarantees or other financial arrangements, following the transaction. Lower performance by those divested businesses could affect our future financial results.  International trade policies may impact demand for our products and our competitive position.  Government policies on international trade and investment such as import quotas, capital controls or tariffs, whether adopted by individual governments or addressed by regional trade blocs, can affect the demand for our products and services, impact the competitive position of our products or prevent us from being able to sell products in certain countries. The implementation of more restrictive trade policies, such as more detailed inspections, higher tariffs or new barriers to entry, in countries where we sell large quantities of products and services could negatively impact our business, results of operations and financial condition. For example, a governments adoption of buy national policies or retaliation by another government against such policies could have a negative impact on our results of operations.  The success of our business depends on our ability to develop, produce and market quality products that meet our customers needs.  Our business relies on continued global demand for our brands and products. To achieve business goals, we must develop and sell products that appeal to our dealers, OEMs and end-user customers. This is dependent on a number of factors, including our ability to maintain key dealer relationships, our ability to produce products that meet the quality, performance and price expectations of our customers and our ability to develop effective sales, advertising and marketing programs. In addition, our continued success in selling products that appeal to our customers is dependent on leading-edge innovation, with respect to both products and operations, and on the availability and effectiveness of legal protection for our innovation. Failure to continue to deliver high quality, innovative, competitive products to the marketplace, to adequately protect our intellectual property rights, to supply products that meet applicable regulatory requirements, including engine exhaust emission requirements or to predict market demands for, or gain market acceptance of, our products, could have a negative impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition. We operate in a highly competitive environment, which could adversely affect our sales and pricing.  We operate in a highly competitive environment, and our outlook depends on a forecast of our share of industry sales based on our ability to compete with others in the marketplace. We compete on the basis of a variety of factors, including product performance, customer service, quality and price. There can be no assurance that our products will be able to compete successfully with other companies products. Thus, our share of industry sales could be reduced due to aggressive pricing or product strategies pursued by competitors, unanticipated product or manufacturing difficulties, our failure to price our products competitively, our failure to produce our products at a competitive cost or an unexpected buildup in competitors new machine or dealer-owned rental fleets, leading to severe downward pressure on machine rental rates and/or used equipment prices.  Our sales outlook assumes that certain price increases we announce from time to time will be realized in the marketplace. Changes in market acceptance of price increases, changes in market requirements for price discounts, changes in our competitors behavior or a weak pricing environment attributable to industry overcapacity could have an adverse impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition.  In addition, our results and ability to compete may be impacted negatively by changes in our sales mix. Our outlook assumes a certain geographic mix of sales as well as a certain product mix of sales. If actual results vary from this projected geographic and product mix of sales, our results could be negatively impacted.  We may not realize all of the anticipated benefits from cost-reduction initiatives, cash flow improvement initiatives and efficiency or productivity initiatives. We are actively engaged in a number of initiatives to increase our productivity, efficiency and cash flow and to reduce costs, which we expect to have a positive effect on our business, competitive position, results of operations and financial condition. For example, we formed the Caterpillar Enterprise System Group in 2013 to implement sustained improvements in our operational efficiency and order-to-delivery processes so that our lead time is better aligned with customer requirements, as well as to reduce waste, further enhance quality and maximize value for our customers. We are also in the process of implementing new enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems in many of our businesses to increase efficiency and harmonize our operations. There can be no assurance that these ERP systems, these initiatives, or others will continue to be beneficial to the extent anticipated, or that the estimated efficiency improvements, incremental cost savings or cash flow improvements will be realized as anticipated or at all. If our new ERP systems are not implemented successfully, it could have an adverse effect on our operations and competitive position. We expect to incur additional restructuring charges as we continue to contemplate cost reduction actions in an effort to optimize our cost structure and may not achieve the anticipated savings and benefits of these actions. On September 24, 2015, we announced significant restructuring and cost reduction actions to lower our operating costs in response to current economic and business conditions. We expect to take additional restructuring actions through 2018 to optimize our cost structure and improve the efficiency of our operation, which will reduce our profitability in the periods incurred. As a result of these actions, we will likely continue to incur charges, which may include but not be limited to asset impairments, employee termination costs, charges for pension and other postretirement contractual benefits, potential additional pension funding obligations, and pension curtailments, any of which could be significant, and could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. In addition, we may not realize anticipated savings or benefits from past or future cost reduction actions in full or in part or within the time periods we expect. We are also subject to the risks of labor unrest, negative publicity and business disruption in connection with our cost reduction actions. Failure to realize anticipated savings or benefits from our cost reduction actions could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition, liquidity, results of operations and cash flows. Our business is subject to the inventory management decisions and sourcing practices of our dealers and our OEM customers.  We sell finished products primarily through an independent dealer network and directly to OEMs and are subject to risks relating to their inventory management decisions and operational and sourcing practices. Both carry inventories of finished products as part of ongoing operations and adjust those inventories based on their assessments of future needs. Such adjustments may impact our results positively or negatively. If the inventory levels of our dealers and OEM customers are higher than they desire, they may postpone product purchases from us, which could cause our sales to be lower than the end-user demand for our products and negatively impact our results. Similarly, our results could be negatively impacted through the loss of time-sensitive sales if our dealers and OEM customers do not maintain inventory levels sufficient to meet customer demand. Additionally, some of our engine customers are OEMs that manufacture or could in the future manufacture engines for their own products. Despite their engine manufacturing abilities, these customers have chosen to outsource certain types of engine production to us due to the quality of our engine products and in order to reduce costs, eliminate production risks and maintain company focus. However, there can be no assurance that these customers will continue to outsource engine manufacture in the future. Decreased levels of production outsourcing by these customers could result from a number of factors, such as shifts in our customers business strategies, acquisition by a customer of another engine manufacturer, the inability of third-party suppliers to meet specifications and the emergence of low-cost production opportunities in foreign countries. A significant reduction in the level of engine production outsourcing from our OEM customers could significantly impact our revenues and, accordingly, have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. We are subject to stringent environmental laws and regulations that impose significant compliance costs.  Our facilities, operations and products are subject to increasingly stringent environmental laws and regulations globally, including laws and regulations governing emissions to noise, air, discharges to water and the generation, handling, storage, transportation, treatment and disposal of non-hazardous and hazardous waste materials. Some environmental laws impose strict, retroactive and joint and several liability for the remediation of the release of hazardous substances, even for conduct that was lawful at the time it occurred, or for the conduct of, or conditions caused by, prior operators, predecessors or other third parties. Failure to comply with environmental laws could expose us to penalties or clean-up costs, civil or criminal liability and sanctions on certain of our activities, as well as damage to property or natural resources. These liabilities, sanctions, damages and remediation efforts related to any non-compliance with such laws and regulations could negatively impact our ability to conduct our operations and our financial condition and results of operations. In addition, there can be no assurances that we will not be adversely affected by costs, liabilities or claims with respect to existing or subsequently acquired operations or under present laws and regulations or those that may be adopted or imposed in the future. Environmental laws and regulations may also change from time to time, as may related interpretations and other guidance. Changes in environmental laws or regulations could result in higher expenses and payments, and uncertainty relating to environmental laws or regulations may also affect how we conduct our operations and structure our investments and could limit our ability to enforce our rights. Changes in environmental and climate change laws or regulations, including laws relating to greenhouse gas emissions, could lead to new or additional investment in product designs and could increase environmental compliance expenditures. Changes in climate change concerns, or in the regulation of such concerns, including greenhouse gas emissions, could subject us to additional costs and restrictions, including increased energy and raw materials costs. If environmental laws or regulations are either changed or adopted and impose significant operational restrictions and compliance requirements upon us or our products, they could negatively impact our business, capital expenditures, results of operations, financial condition and competitive position.  Our global operations are subject to extensive trade and anti-corruption laws and regulations.  Due to the international scope of our operations, we are subject to a complex system of import- and export-related laws and regulations, including U.S. regulations issued by Customs and Border Protection, the Bureau of Industry and Security, the Office of Antiboycott Compliance, the Directorate of Defense Trade Controls and the Office of Foreign Assets Control, as well as the counterparts of these agencies in other countries. Any alleged or actual violations may subject us to government scrutiny, investigation and civil and criminal penalties, and may limit our ability to import or export our products or to provide services outside the United States. Furthermore, embargoes and sanctions imposed by the U.S. and other governments restricting or prohibiting sales to specific persons or countries or based on product classification expose us to potential criminal and civil sanctions. We cannot predict the nature, scope or effect of future regulatory requirements to which our operations might be subject or the manner in which existing laws might be administered or interpreted.  In addition, the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and similar foreign anti-corruption laws generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments or providing anything of value to improperly influence foreign government officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business, or obtaining an unfair advantage. Recent years have seen a substantial increase in the global enforcement of anti-corruption laws. Our operations outside the United States, including in developing countries, could increase the risk of such violations. In addition, we enter into joint ventures with joint venture partners who are domiciled in areas of the world with laws, regulations and business practices that differ from those in the United States. There is risk that our joint venture partners will violate applicable laws and regulations. Violations of anti-corruption laws or regulations by our employees, by intermediaries acting on our behalf, or by our joint venture partners may result in severe criminal or civil sanctions, could disrupt our business, and result in an adverse effect on our reputation, business and results of operations or financial condition. We may incur additional tax expense or become subject to additional tax exposure.  We are subject to income taxes in the United States and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Our domestic and international tax liabilities are dependent upon the location of earnings among these different jurisdictions. Our future results of operations could be adversely affected by changes in the effective tax rate as a result of a change in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in our overall profitability, changes in tax laws or treaties or in their application or interpretation, changes in tax rates, changes in generally accepted accounting principles, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, changes in the amount of earnings indefinitely reinvested offshore, the results of audits and examinations of previously filed tax returns and continuing assessments of our tax exposures. We are also subject to the continuous examination of our income tax returns by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities. We regularly assess the likelihood of an adverse outcome resulting from these examinations. If our effective tax rates were to increase, or if the ultimate determination of our taxes owed is for an amount in excess of amounts previously accrued, our operating results, cash flows and financial condition could be adversely affected. For information regarding additional legal matters related to our taxes, please see Note 5  \"Income taxes\" and Note 22  \"Environmental and legal matters\" of Part II, Item 8 \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\" to this Annual Report on Form 10-K .  Currency exchange rate fluctuations affect our results of operations, as reported in our financial statements.  We conduct operations in many areas of the world, involving transactions denominated in a variety of currencies. We are subject to currency exchange rate risk to the extent that our costs are denominated in currencies other than those in which we earn revenues. In addition, changes in currency exchange rates have had, and will continue to have, an impact on our results of operations. There can be no assurance that currency exchange rate fluctuations will not adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. While the use of currency hedging instruments may provide us with protection from adverse fluctuations in currency exchange rates, by utilizing these instruments we potentially forego the benefits that might result from favorable fluctuations in currency exchange rates. In addition, our outlooks do not assume fluctuations in currency exchange rates. Adverse fluctuations in currency exchange rates from the date of our outlooks could cause our actual results to differ materially from those anticipated in our outlooks and adversely impact our business, results of operations and financial condition.  We also face risks arising from the imposition of exchange controls and currency devaluations. Exchange controls may limit our ability to convert foreign currencies into U.S. dollars or to remit dividends and other payments by our foreign subsidiaries or businesses located in or conducted within a country imposing controls. Currency devaluations result in a diminished value of funds denominated in the currency of the country instituting the devaluation.  Restrictive covenants in our debt agreements could limit our financial and operating flexibility.  We maintain a number of credit facilities to support general corporate purposes (facilities) and have issued debt securities to manage liquidity and fund operations (debt securities). The agreements relating to a number of the facilities and the debt securities contain certain restrictive covenants applicable to us and certain of our subsidiaries, including Cat Financial. These covenants include maintaining a consolidated net worth (defined as the consolidated stockholders equity including preferred stock but excluding the pension and other post-retirement benefits balance within accumulated other comprehensive income (loss)) of not less than $9 billion, limitations on the incurrence of liens and certain restrictions on consolidation and merger. Cat Financial has also agreed under certain of these agreements to maintain a leverage ratio (consolidated debt to consolidated net worth, calculated (1) on a monthly basis as the average of the leverage ratios determined on the last day of each of the six preceding calendar months and (2) at each December 31) not greater than 10.0 to 1, to maintain a minimum interest coverage ratio (profit excluding income taxes, interest expense and net gain/(loss) from interest rate derivatives to interest expense, calculated at the end of each calendar quarter for the rolling four quarter period then most recently ended) of not less than 1.15 to 1 and not to terminate, amend or modify its support agreement with us.  A breach of one or more of the covenants could result in adverse consequences that could negatively impact our business, results of operations and financial condition. These consequences may include the acceleration of amounts outstanding under certain of the facilities, triggering of an obligation to redeem certain debt securities, termination of existing unused commitments by our lenders, refusal by our lenders to extend further credit under one or more of the facilities or to enter into new facilities or the lowering or modification of our credit ratings or those of one or more of our subsidiaries.  Sustained increases in funding obligations under our pension plans may reduce our profitability.  We maintain certain defined benefit pension plans for our employees, which impose on us certain funding obligations. In determining our future payment obligations under the plans, we assume certain rates of return on the plan assets and growth rates of certain costs. Significant adverse changes in credit or capital markets could result in actual rates of return being materially lower than projected and increased pension expense in future years. We are expecting to make contributions to our pension plans in the future, and may be required to make contributions that could be material. Our cost growth rates may also be materially higher than projected. These factors could significantly increase our payment obligations under the plans, and as a result, adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.  Union disputes or other labor matters could adversely affect our operations and financial results .  Some of our employees are represented by labor unions in a number of countries under various collective bargaining agreements with varying durations and expiration dates. There can be no assurance that any current or future issues with our employees will be resolved or that we will not encounter future strikes, work stoppages or other types of conflicts with labor unions or our employees. We may not be able to satisfactorily renegotiate collective bargaining agreements in the United States and other countries when they expire. If we fail to renegotiate our existing collective bargaining agreements, we could encounter strikes or work stoppages or other types of conflicts with labor unions. In addition, existing collective bargaining agreements may not prevent a strike or work stoppage at our facilities in the future. We may also be subject to general country strikes or work stoppages unrelated to our business or collective bargaining agreements. A work stoppage or other limitations on production at our facilities for any reason could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. In addition, many of our customers and suppliers have unionized work forces. Strikes or work stoppages experienced by our customers or suppliers could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.  Costs associated with lawsuits or investigations or adverse rulings in enforcement or other legal proceedings may have an adverse effect on our results of operations.  We are subject to a variety of legal proceedings and legal compliance risks in virtually every part of the world. We face an inherent business risk of exposure to various types of claims, lawsuits and government investigations. We are involved in various intellectual property, product liability, product warranty and environmental claims and lawsuits and other legal proceedings that arise in and outside of the ordinary course of our business. The industries in which we operate are also periodically reviewed or investigated by regulators, which could lead to enforcement actions, fines and penalties or the assertion of private litigation claims. It is not possible to predict with certainty the outcome of claims, investigations and lawsuits, and we could in the future incur judgments, fines or penalties or enter into settlements of lawsuits and claims that could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition in any particular period.  The global and diverse nature of our operations means that legal and compliance risks will continue to exist and additional legal proceedings and other contingencies, the outcome of which cannot be predicted with certainty, will arise from time to time. In addition, subsequent developments in legal proceedings may affect our assessment and estimates of loss contingencies recorded as a reserve and require us to make payments in excess of our reserves, which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations.  Changes in accounting guidance could have an adverse effect on our results of operations, as reported in our financial statements.  Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America (U.S. GAAP), which is periodically revised and/or expanded. Accordingly, from time to time we are required to adopt new or revised accounting guidance and related interpretations issued by recognized authoritative bodies, including the Financial Accounting Standards Board and the SEC. The impact of accounting pronouncements that have been issued but not yet implemented is disclosed in this annual report on Form 10-K and our quarterly reports on Form 10-Q. An assessment of proposed standards is not provided, as such proposals are subject to change through the exposure process and, therefore, their effects on our financial statements cannot be meaningfully assessed. It is possible that future accounting guidance we are required to adopt, or future changes in accounting principles, could change the current accounting treatment that we apply to our consolidated financial statements and that such changes could have an adverse effect on our results of operations, as reported in our consolidated financial statements.  Increased information technology security threats and more sophisticated computer crime pose a risk to our systems, networks, products and services. We rely upon information technology systems and networks, some of which are managed by third parties, in connection with a variety of business activities. Additionally, we collect and store data that is sensitive to Caterpillar. Operating these information technology systems and networks and processing and maintaining this data, in a secure manner, are critical to our business operations and strategy. Information technology security threats -- from user error to cybersecurity attacks designed to gain unauthorized access to our systems, networks and data -- are increasing in frequency and sophistication. Cybersecurity attacks may range from random attempts to coordinated and targeted attacks, including sophisticated computer crime and advanced threats. These threats pose a risk to the security of our systems and networks and the confidentiality, availability and integrity of our data. We have experienced cybersecurity attacks that have resulted in unauthorized parties gaining access to our information technology systems and networks, and we could in the future experience similar attacks. However, to date, no cybersecurity attack has had a material impact on our financial condition, results of operations or liquidity. While we actively manage information technology security risks within our control, there can be no assurance that such actions will be sufficient to mitigate all potential risks to our systems, networks and data. The potential consequences of a material cybersecurity attack include reputational damage, litigation with third parties, diminution in the value of our investment in research, development and engineering, and increased cybersecurity protection and remediation costs, which in turn could adversely affect our competitiveness and results of operations.  Unexpected events, including natural disasters, may increase our cost of doing business or disrupt our operations.  The occurrence of one or more unexpected events, including war, terrorist acts, fires, tornadoes, tsunamis, hurricanes, earthquakes, floods and other forms of severe weather in the United States or in other countries in which we operate or in which our suppliers are located could adversely affect our operations and financial performance. Natural disasters, pandemic illness, equipment failures, power outages or other unexpected events could result in physical damage to and complete or partial closure of one or more of our manufacturing facilities or distribution centers, temporary or long-term disruption in the supply of component products from some local and international suppliers, disruption in the transport of our products to dealers and end-users and delay in the delivery of our products to our distribution centers. Existing insurance arrangements may not provide protection for all of the costs that may arise from such events. ##TABLE_START ", "1B": " Item 1B.

Properties. ##TABLE_END  General Information Caterpillars operations are highly integrated. Although the majority of our plants are involved primarily in production relating to our Construction Industries, Resource Industries or Energy  Transportation segments, several plants are involved in manufacturing relating to more than one business segment. In addition, several plants reported in our financial statements under the All Other segments are involved in the manufacturing of components that are used in the assembly of products for more than one business segment. Caterpillars parts distribution centers are involved in the storage and distribution of parts for Construction Industries, Resource Industries and Energy  Transportation, and are included in the All Other segments. The research and development activities carried on at our Technical Center in Mossville, Illinois involve products for Construction Industries, Resource Industries and Energy  Transportation.

Risk Factors of this Form 10-K. OVERVIEW  Our 2015 sales and revenues were $47.011 billion, a decrease of 15 percent from $55.184 billion in 2014. The two most significant reasons for the decline from 2014 were weakening economic growth and substantially lower commodity prices. The impact of weak economic growth was most pronounced in developing countries, such as China and Brazil. Lower oil prices had a substantial negative impact on the portion of Energy  Transportation that supports oil drilling and well servicing. Profit in 2015 was $2.102 billion, a decrease of 43 percent from $3.695 billion in 2014. The 2015 profit per share was $3.50, down 40 percent from $5.88 in 2014. Profit declined primarily due to lower sales volume . Fourth-quarter 2015 sales and revenues were $11.030 billion, down $3.214 billion from $14.244 billion in the fourth quarter of 2014. Fourth-quarter 2015 loss was $87 million compared with profit of $757 million in the fourth quarter of 2014. The loss was $0.15 per share in the fourth quarter of 2015 compared with profit per share of $1.23 in the fourth quarter of 2014. Highlights for 2015 include: ##TABLE_START  2015 sales and revenues were $47.011 billion, down 15 percent from 2014. Sales declined in all regions and in all segments. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Restructuring costs were $908 million in 2015 with an after-tax impact of $1.14 per share. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Profit per share was $3.50 in 2015, or $4.64 per share excluding restructuring costs. Profit in 2014 was $5.88 per share, or $6.38 per share excluding restructuring costs. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Inventory declined about $1.45 billion during the fourth quarter of 2015. For the full year, inventory decreased about $2.5 billion. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Machinery, Energy  Transportation (MET) operating cash flow for 2015 was about $5.2 billion. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  MET debt-to-capital ratio was 39.1 percent at the end of 2015, compared with 37.4 percent at the end of 2014. We ended the year with about $6.5 billion of enterprise cash. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  During the year, we repurchased about $2 billion of Caterpillar stock and increased the quarterly dividend by 10 percent. ##TABLE_END Restructuring Costs For the past several years, we have incurred substantial restructuring costs as a result of actions to lower our cost structure in response to weak economic conditions in the key industries we serve. In 2015, we incurred $908 million of restructuring costs for employee separation costs related to a reduction in workforce and for costs related to closure and consolidation of numerous manufacturing facilities throughout the company. We incurred restructuring costs of $441 million in 2014, including $273 million related to actions at our Gosselies, Belgium, facility to reduce costs and improve competitiveness. We expect to take additional restructuring actions in 2016 and anticipate that these actions will result in costs of about $400 million. * Glossary of terms included on pages 46 to 48; first occurrence of terms shown in bold italics. 2015 COMPARED WITH 2014 CONSOLIDATED SALES AND REVENUES The chart above graphically illustrates reasons for the change in Consolidated Sales and Revenues between 2014 (at left) and 2015 (at right). Items favorably impacting sales and revenues appear as upward stair steps with the corresponding dollar amounts above each bar, while items negatively impacting sales and revenues appear as downward stair steps with dollar amounts reflected in parentheses above each bar. Caterpillar management utilizes these charts internally to visually communicate with the company's Board of Directors and employees. Total sales and revenues were $47.011 billion in 2015, down $8.173 billion, or 15 percent, from 2014. The decrease was largely due to lower sales volume, primarily in Energy  Transportation and Construction Industries . Sales volume was also lower in Resource Industries . Currency had an unfavorable impact of $1.7 billion due to continued strengthening of the U.S. dollar against most currencies, with the largest impact from the euro. We expect the continued strength of the U.S. dollar to negatively impact sales in 2016. While sales for both new equipment and aftermarket parts declined in Energy  Transportation, Construction Industries and Resource Industries, most of the decrease was for new equipment. Financial Products revenues declined $178 million. While price realization was about flat from 2014 to 2015, it was positive in the first half of 2015 and negative over the second half of 2015. We expect that negative trend to continue in 2016. We are experiencing pricing pressure from the competitive nature of the businesses we are in and from the impact of a stronger U.S. dollar. The two most significant reasons for the decline in sales and revenues from 2014 were weakening economic growth and substantially lower commodity prices. The impact of weak economic growth was most pronounced in developing countries, such as China and Brazil. Lower oil prices had a substantial negative impact on the portion of Energy  Transportation that supports oil drilling and well servicing, where new order rates in 2015 were down close to 90 percent from 2014. We do not expect an improvement in world economic growth or commodity prices in 2016 and expect our 2016 sales and revenues to be lower than 2015. The impact of changes in dealer machine and engine inventories was about flat. In total, dealer inventories decreased about $1 billion in both 2015 and 2014. We expect that a further decline in sales in 2016 will cause dealers to reduce inventory levels about as much as they did in 2015. Dealers are independent, and there could be many reasons for changes in their inventory levels. In general, dealers adjust inventory based on their expectations of future demand and product delivery times. Dealers demand expectations take into account seasonal changes, macroeconomic conditions and other factors. Delivery times can vary based on availability of product from Caterpillar factories and product distribution centers. Sales declined in all regions. Sales in North America declined 11 percent, primarily in Energy  Transportation with the most significant decrease in rail applications. Sales also declined in Resource Industries and Construction Industries. In Asia/Pacific, sales declined 19 percent, primarily due to lower end-user demand for construction and mining equipment and oil and gas applications. The impact of currency was also unfavorable, as our sales in Japanese yen and Australian dollars translated into fewer U.S. dollars. In EAME , sales declined 14 percent, primarily due to the unfavorable impact of currency, as our sales in euros translated into fewer U.S. dollars. The remaining sales decline is primarily due to lower sales in Russia as a recession slowed demand and the absence of a large power generation project that occurred in 2014. Latin America sales decreased 28 percent due to lower end-user demand, mostly for construction equipment. The decline was due to continued widespread economic weakness across the region with the most significant decline in Brazil due to continued weak construction activity resulting from depressed economic conditions. By segment, sales decreased in Energy  Transportation, Construction Industries and Resource Industries. Energy  Transportations sales declined 17 percent with much of the decline a result of low oil prices. Construction Industries sales declined 14 percent, primarily due to lower end-user demand and the unfavorable impact of currency. Resource Industries sales declined 15 percent, primarily due to weaker demand for mining products, partially offset by the favorable impact of changes in dealer inventories, as dealer inventories decreased more in 2014 than in 2015. Financial Products' segment revenues decreased 7 percent, primarily due to lower average earning assets and lower average financing rates. CONSOLIDATED OPERATING PROFIT The chart above graphically illustrates reasons for the change in Consolidated Operating Profit between 2014 (at left) and 2015 (at right). Items favorably impacting operating profit  appear as upward stair steps with the corresponding dollar amounts above each bar, while items negatively impacting operating profit appear as downward stair steps with dollar amounts reflected in parentheses above each bar. Caterpillar management utilizes these charts internally to visually communicate with the company's Board of Directors and employees. The bar entitled Other includes consolidating adjustments and Machinery, Energy  Transportation other operating (income) expenses . Operating profit for 2015 was $3.256 billion, a decrease of $2.072 billion from 2014. The decrease was primarily the result of lower sales volume and higher restructuring costs, partially offset by lower manufacturing costs , the favorable impact of currency and lower SGA and RD expenses . Restructuring costs of $908 million in 2015, included in corporate items, were primarily related to a reduction in workforce across the company. In 2014, restructuring costs were $441 million, primarily related to a workforce reduction at the Gosselies, Belgium, facility and other actions across the company. Our restructuring activities continued in 2015 as part of our ongoing efforts to optimize our cost structure and improve the efficiency of our operations. In 2016, we expect to incur restructuring costs related to programs started in 2015 and for additional actions to further improve our long-term cost structure. Manufacturing costs were lower primarily due to improved material costs and lower incentive compensation expense. Favorable material costs were due to declines in commodity prices and a focus on reducing the cost of components in our products. These lower costs were partially offset by the unfavorable impact of cost absorption as there was a more significant inventory decline in 2015 than 2014, and manufacturing inefficiencies driven by costs decreasing at a lower rate than production volume. In 2016, we expect lower material costs as a result of lower commodity prices and supplier collaboration, favorable cost absorption as we expect a smaller inventory decline in 2016 than in 2015 and favorable variable manufacturing costs as we focus on operational improvements. The favorable impact of currency was primarily due to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar in relation to the Japanese yen and British pound, as we are a net exporter from Japan and the United Kingdom. SGA and RD expenses declined as lower incentive compensation expense was partially offset by higher spending for new product introductions. Short-term incentive compensation expense related to 2015, was about $585 million compared to about $1.3 billion of short-term incentive compensation expense related to 2014. Short-term incentive compensation expense is directly related to financial and operational performance measured against targets set annually. In 2016, we expect a greater proportion of the expected sales decline will occur in higher margin products for the oil and gas and mining industries, likely resulting in an unfavorable impact on operating margin. Other Profit/Loss Items Other income/expense was income of $106 million in 2015, compared with income of $239 million in 2014. The change was primarily due to the unfavorable net impact of currency translation and hedging gains and losses, partially offset by a gain of $120 million on the sale of the remaining 35 percent interest in our former third party logistics business. Translation and hedging losses in 2015 totaled $228 million primarily due to the Brazilian real and Japanese yen. In 2014, translation and hedging gains were $54 million primarily due to the euro. The provision for income taxes for 2015 reflects an estimated annual tax rate of 24.5 percent compared with 28 percent for 2014, excluding the items discussed below. The decrease is primarily due to a more favorable geographic mix of profits from a tax perspective in 2015, including the impact of restructuring costs primarily at higher U.S. tax rates. The provision for income taxes for 2015 also includes a $42 million net charge to increase unrecognized tax benefits by $68 million partially offset by a benefit of $26 million to record U.S. refund claims related to prior tax years currently under examination. Our consideration of decisions by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit in 2015 involving other taxpayers caused us to increase our unrecognized tax benefits related to foreign tax credits that arose as a result of certain financings. The 2014 tax provision also included a benefit of $23 million for the release of a valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets of a non-U.S. subsidiary and a net benefit of $21 million to adjust prior years U.S. taxes and interest.

The sales decrease was due to lower sales volume and the unfavorable impact of currency. While sales for both new equipment and aftermarket parts declined, most of the decrease was for new equipment. ##TABLE_START  The decrease in sales volume was primarily due to lower deliveries to end users caused by widespread economic weakness primarily in developing countries. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  The unfavorable currency impact was primarily from a weaker euro, Japanese yen and Brazilian real, as sales in these currencies translated into fewer U.S. dollars. ##TABLE_END Sales decreased in all geographic regions. ##TABLE_START  In Asia/Pacific, the sales decline was primarily due to lower sales in China and Japan. In China, the lower sales resulted primarily from continued weak residential and nonresidential construction activity, which we expect to continue in 2016. Sales in Japan declined due to a weaker Japanese yen, as sales in yen translated into fewer U.S. dollars. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Decreases in Latin America were primarily related to lower demand due to continued weak construction activity with the most significant impact in Brazil. In addition, the absence of a large government order that occurred in 2014 and the unfavorable impact of a weaker Brazilian real contributed to the decline in sales in Brazil. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Sales declined in EAME primarily due to the unfavorable impact of currency, as sales in euros translated into fewer U.S. dollars. ##TABLE_END 31 ##TABLE_START  In North America, the sales decline was due to both lower end-user demand and unfavorable changes in dealer inventory, as dealer inventories remained relatively flat in 2015 compared to an increase in 2014. Lack of investment in oil and gas-related construction activity and a decline in infrastructure spending were partially offset by stronger activity in residential and nonresidential building construction. We believe declines in construction activity related to oil and gas have resulted in availability of existing construction equipment for other purposes. We expect general and heavy construction activity to expand in 2016 in the United States. However, we believe this will not translate into higher sales volume in the United States because low construction activity related to oil and gas will continue to free up equipment for building and infrastructure construction jobsites. ##TABLE_END Construction Industries profit was $1.925 billion in 2015, compared with $2.207 billion in 2014. The decrease in profit was primarily due to lower sales volume, partially offset by lower manufacturing costs, SGA and RD expenses and the favorable impact of currency. Manufacturing costs were favorable primarily due to lower incentive compensation expense and improved material costs. SGA and RD expenses were lower primarily due to lower incentive compensation expense. Resource Industries Resource Industries sales were $7.551 billion in 2015, a decrease of $1.370 billion, or 15 percent, from 2014, primarily due to lower sales volume and the unfavorable impact of currency, mostly the euro and Australian dollar. Price realization was slightly unfavorable, resulting from a competitive pricing environment. Sales declined for both new equipment and aftermarket parts. We believe some mining companies are continuing to curtail maintenance and rebuild activities. Commodity prices remained weak, and mining customers continued to focus on improving productivity in existing mines and reducing their total capital expenditures as they have for the last several years. As a result, sales and new orders in Resource Industries continued to weaken. We are expecting a further decline in sales volume in 2016 as a result of continued reductions in mining-related commodity prices and difficult financial conditions for many mining customers around the world. The sales volume decrease was partially offset by the favorable impact of changes in dealer inventories. While dealers continued to reduce inventories in 2015, the reductions were less significant than in 2014. Sales decreased in all geographic regions. ##TABLE_START  In EAME, the sales decline was primarily due to lower end-user demand and the unfavorable impact of currency due to a weaker euro, as sales in euro translated into fewer U.S. dollars. The decline was partially offset by the favorable impact of changes in dealer inventories. While dealers continued to reduce inventories in 2015, the reductions were less significant than in 2014. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  In North America, the sales decline was primarily due to lower end-user demand driven by lower sales of mining equipment partially offset by increases in sales of equipment used to support the quarry and aggregate industry and the favorable impact of changes in dealer inventories. While dealers continued to reduce inventories in 2015, the reductions were less significant than in 2014. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Sales declined in Asia/Pacific primarily due to lower end-user demand and the unfavorable impact of currency, mostly due to the Australian dollar, as sales translated into fewer U.S. dollars, partially offset by the favorable impact of changes in dealer inventories. While dealers continued to reduce inventories in 2015, the reductions were less significant than in 2014. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Decreases in Latin America were primarily related to continued weak mining activity and slightly unfavorable price realization resulting from a competitive pricing environment. The decline was partially offset by the favorable impact of changes in dealer inventories. While dealers continued to reduce inventories in 2015, the reductions were less significant than in 2014. ##TABLE_END Resource Industries loss was $88 million in 2015, compared with profit of $404 million in 2014. The decrease was primarily the result of lower sales volume, higher spending for new product introductions and unfavorable price realization, partially offset by lower manufacturing costs, primarily from improved material costs. We expect unfavorable price realization in 2016 due to continued pricing pressure from the competitive nature of the business and the impact of a stronger U.S. dollar. Energy  Transportation Energy  Transportations sales were $17.938 billion in 2015, a decrease of $3.789 billion, or 17 percent, from 2014. The sales decrease was primarily due to lower sales volume and the unfavorable impact of currency, mainly from a weaker euro. Sales decreased in all geographic regions and across all applications. ##TABLE_START  Oil and Gas - The sales decrease was driven by lower end-user demand as oil prices continued to decline. Sales decreased in all regions. In North America, sales were lower primarily due to a decline in end-user demand for reciprocating engines used in drilling, well servicing and gas compression applications. Sales declined in Asia/Pacific primarily from lower end-user demand for equipment used in drilling applications and the unfavorable impact of changes in dealer inventories as ##TABLE_END 32 inventories decreased in 2015 and were about flat in 2014. In Latin America, sales were lower primarily due to the absence of a large project that occurred in 2014. Sales declined in EAME due to depressed oil prices and the unfavorable impact of currency, primarily from a weaker euro. During the first half of 2015, sales remained at relatively high levels for equipment used in gas compression, well servicing and drilling because we started the year with a substantial order backlog. Sales declined during the second half of 2015 as orders from the backlog were shipped and new order levels were weak. Because of that impact, along with the further decline in oil prices, we expect reciprocating engine sales in well servicing, drilling and gas compression to decline in 2016. Sales in our turbine business are also expected to decline in 2016. Based on the current backlog and recent quotation activity, decreases in turbine sales related to oil projects in 2016 are expected to more than offset increases in turbine sales related to gas compression. ##TABLE_START  Transportation - Sales decreased in North America and were about flat in all other geographic regions. In North America, sales into rail applications decreased primarily due to the absence of a Tier IV locomotive offering and lower sales of recyclable materials. The decline of recyclable materials was driven primarily by the year-over-year decrease in scrap prices and the lower volume of railcars available to scrap. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Power Generation - Sales decreased in EAME and North America and were about flat in all other regions. In EAME, the sales decline was primarily due to lower end-user demand resulting from the absence of a large project that occurred in 2014, weak economic conditions and political instability in the region, and the negative impact of currency. Sales declined in North America mostly due to the absence of several large projects and unfavorable impact of changes in dealer inventories as inventories decreased in 2015 and were about flat in 2014. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Industrial - Sales decreased in all regions except Latin America which was about flat. In EAME, sales decreased primarily due to lower end-user demand for engines used by original equipment manufacturers for agriculture and construction applications and the unfavorable impact of currency. In both Asia/Pacific and North America, lower demand for most industrial applications contributed to the sales decrease. ##TABLE_END While oil and gas represents the most significant decline, continuing weakness in economic conditions in much of the world is expected to be negative for sales of power generation equipment, industrial engines, marine and rail in 2016. Energy  Transportations profit was $3.239 billion in 2015, compared with $4.135 billion in 2014. The decrease was primarily due to lower sales volume, which includes a favorable mix of products, partially offset by lower incentive compensation expense. Excluding incentive compensation expense, manufacturing costs were about flat as improved material costs were about offset by the unfavorable impact of cost absorption and manufacturing inefficiencies driven by costs decreasing at a lower rate than production volume. The unfavorable impact of cost absorption resulted from a significant decrease in inventory in 2015, compared to an increase in inventory in 2014. SGA and RD expenses were favorable as lower incentive compensation expense was partially offset by increases in program spending including for new product introductions. Financial Products Segment Financial Products revenues were $3.078 billion, a decrease of $235 million, or 7 percent, from 2014. The decline was primarily due to lower average earning assets and lower average financing rates. Average earning assets were down in Asia/Pacific, Latin America and EAME, partially offset by higher average earning assets in North America. Average financing rates decreased primarily in North America and EAME. Financial Products profit was $809 million in 2015, compared with $901 million in 2014. The decrease was primarily due to a $68 million decrease in net yield on average earning assets reflecting changes in the geographic mix of margin and currency impacts and a $55 million unfavorable impact from lower average earning assets, partially offset by a $33 million decrease in the provision for credit losses at Cat Financial. The decrease in provision for credit losses at Cat Financial was primarily due to a favorable impact from changes in the allowance rate and a favorable impact from changes in portfolio balances, partially offset by an increase in write-offs, net of recoveries. The favorable impact from changes in the allowance rate was driven by changes in certain assumptions within the allowance for credit loss model. During 2015, as a result of management's review, the loss emergence period and loss given default assumptions were updated and resulted in a decrease to the allowance for credit losses of $66 million. At the end of 2015, past dues at Cat Financial were 2.14 percent, compared with 2.17 percent at the end of 2014. Write-offs, net of recoveries, were $155 million for the full-year 2015, compared with $104 million for the full-year 2014. The increase in write-offs, net of recoveries, was primarily driven by the mining and marine portfolios. As of December 31, 2015, Cat Financial's allowance for credit losses totaled $338 million, or 1.22 percent of net finance receivables, compared with $401 million, or 1.36 percent of net finance receivables, at year-end 2014. Corporate Items and Eliminations Expense for corporate items and eliminations was $3.149 billion in 2015, an increase of $258 million from 2014. Corporate items and eliminations include: corporate-level expenses; restructuring costs; timing differences, as some expenses are reported in segment profit on a cash basis; retirement benefit costs other than service cost; currency differences for MET, as segment profit is reported using annual fixed exchange rates, and inter-segment eliminations. The increase in expense in 2015 was primarily due to a $467 million increase in restructuring costs and an unfavorable impact from methodology differences, partially offset by a favorable impact from timing differences. FOURTH QUARTER 2015 COMPARED WITH FOURTH QUARTER 2014  CONSOLIDATED SALES AND REVENUES The chart above graphically illustrates reasons for the change in Consolidated Sales and Revenues between the fourth quarter of 2014 (at left) and the fourth quarter of 2015 (at right). Items favorably impacting sales and revenues appear as upward stair steps with the corresponding dollar amounts above each bar, while items negatively impacting sales and revenues appear as downward stair steps with dollar amounts reflected in parentheses above each bar. Caterpillar management utilizes these charts internally to visually communicate with the company's Board of Directors and employees. Sales and Revenues Total sales and revenues were $11.030 billion in the fourth quarter of 2015, compared with $14.244 billion in the fourth quarter of 2014, a decline of $3.214 billion, or 23 percent. The decrease was primarily due to lower sales volume and the unfavorable impact of currency due to continued strengthening of the U.S. dollar against most currencies, with about half of the impact from the euro. The two most significant reasons for the decline in sales in 2015 were weakening economic growth primarily in developing countries and substantially lower commodity prices, most notably oil. While sales for both new equipment and aftermarket parts declined in all segments, most of the decrease was for new equipment. Sales declined in all regions. In North America, sales decreased 26 percent due to lower end-user demand, primarily in Energy  Transportation, and unfavorable changes in dealer inventories, mostly in Construction Industries. In EAME, sales declined 20 percent, mostly due to lower end-user demand for products used in Energy  Transportation applications and the unfavorable impact of currency, as sales in euros translated into fewer U.S. dollars. Sales decreased 36 percent in Latin America, primarily due to widespread economic weakness across the region, which had a negative impact on construction and mining activity and demand for products used in oil and gas applications. The most significant decrease was in Brazil. Asia/Pacific sales declined 16 percent, primarily due to lower end-user demand for Energy  Transportation applications and products used in mining. In addition, the impact of currency was unfavorable as sales, mostly in Australian dollars and Japanese yen, translated into fewer U.S. dollars. These unfavorable items were partially offset by favorable changes in dealer inventories as dealers reduced inventories more significantly in the fourth quarter of 2014 compared to the fourth quarter of 2015. Sales decreased in all segments. Energy  Transportations sales declined 29 percent as sales decreased due to lower end-user demand and the unfavorable impact of currency. Construction Industries sales decreased 18 percent, primarily due to the unfavorable impact of changes in dealer inventories as dealers decreased inventories more significantly in the fourth quarter of 2015 compared to the fourth quarter of 2014. Additionally, dealer deliveries to end users, the impact of currency and price realization were unfavorable. Resource Industries sales declined 23 percent, mostly due to continued low end-user demand. Financial Products segment revenues were down 8 percent, primarily due to lower average earning assets and lower average financing rates. CONSOLIDATED OPERATING PROFIT The chart above graphically illustrates reasons for the change in Consolidated Operating Profit between the fourth quarter of 2014 (at left) and the fourth quarter of 2015 (at right). Items favorably impacting operating profit  appear as upward stair steps with the corresponding dollar amounts above each bar, while items negatively impacting operating profit appear as downward stair steps with dollar amounts reflected in parentheses above each bar. Caterpillar management utilizes these charts internally to visually communicate with the company's Board of Directors and employees. The bar entitled Other includes consolidating adjustments and Machinery, Energy  Transportation other operating (income) expenses. Operating loss for the fourth quarter of 2015 was $114 million, compared with operating profit of $1.063 billion in the fourth quarter of 2014. The decrease of $1.177 billion was primarily due to lower sales volume reflecting weak market conditions in most of the industries we serve, higher restructuring costs and unfavorable price realization. These items were partially offset by favorable manufacturing costs and lower SGA and RD expenses. The unfavorable price realization resulted from competitive market conditions and an unfavorable geographic mix of sales. Manufacturing costs were favorable due to lower incentive compensation expense, lower spending due to cost reduction efforts and improved material costs partially offset by the unfavorable impact of cost absorption as inventory decreased more significantly in the fourth quarter of 2015 than in the fourth quarter of 2014. SGA and RD expenses were favorable due to lower incentive compensation expense and lower spending due to cost reduction efforts. Although the strong U.S. dollar had a negative impact to our sales, our sizable manufacturing presence outside of the United States resulted in a favorable impact to costs and operating profit. Restructuring costs of $682 million in the fourth quarter of 2015 were primarily related to a reduction in workforce. In the fourth quarter of 2014, restructuring costs were $97 million. Other Profit/Loss Items ##TABLE_START  Other income/expense in the fourth quarter of 2015 was income of  $30 million, compared with income of $3 million in the fourth quarter of 2014. The favorable change of $27 million was primarily due to gains on the sale of securities in the fourth quarter of 2015. The net impact from currency translation and hedging gains and losses was about flat. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  The provision for income taxes for the fourth quarter of 2015 reflects an effective tax rate of 24.5 percent, compared with 28 percent for the fourth quarter of 2014 excluding the items discussed below. The decrease is primarily due to a more favorable geographic mix of profits from a tax perspective in 2015, including the impact of restructuring costs primarily at higher U.S. tax rates. ##TABLE_END The provision for income taxes for the fourth quarter of 2015 also includes a benefit of $77 million related to the decrease from the third-quarter estimated annual tax rate of 27 percent, primarily due to the renewal in the fourth quarter of the U.S. research and development tax credit. The provision for income taxes for the fourth quarter of 2014 also included benefits of $85 million related to a decrease from the third-quarter estimated annual effective tax rate and the release of a valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets of a non-U.S. subsidiary.

The decrease in sales was mostly due to lower volume and the unfavorable impact of currency. While sales declined for both new equipment and aftermarket parts, most of the decrease was for new equipment. ##TABLE_START  Sales volume declined primarily due to the unfavorable impact of changes in dealer inventories as dealers decreased inventories more significantly in the fourth quarter of 2015 compared to the fourth quarter of 2014. In addition, deliveries to end users decreased. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  The unfavorable impact of currency was largely due to the euro, Japanese yen and Brazilian real. ##TABLE_END Sales decreased in North America, Latin America and Asia/Pacific, while sales in EAME were about flat. ##TABLE_START  In North America, sales declined mostly due to dealers substantially reducing inventories in the fourth quarter of 2015, compared to maintaining inventory levels in the fourth quarter of 2014. Although residential and nonresidential construction activity is improving, sales to end users were lower than the fourth quarter of 2014. We believe declines in construction activity related to oil and gas has resulted in availability of existing construction equipment for other purposes. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  In Latin America, dealer deliveries were down across the region, with the most significant decline in Brazil due to continued weak construction activity resulting from depressed economic conditions. In addition, sales declined due to the unfavorable impact of changes in dealer inventories as dealers lowered inventories in the fourth quarter of 2015, compared to relatively flat inventories in the fourth quarter of 2014. ##TABLE_END 37 ##TABLE_START  In Asia/Pacific, the sales decline was primarily due to lower sales in China and India and the unfavorable impact of currency. The most significant decline was in China, a result of continued weak residential and nonresidential construction activity. The unfavorable impact of currency was primarily due to the weaker Japanese yen and Australian dollar. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Sales in EAME were about flat as lower end-user demand and the unfavorable impact of currency were about offset by the favorable impact of changes in dealer inventories. Dealers lowered inventories more in the fourth quarter of 2014 than in the fourth quarter of 2015. ##TABLE_END Construction Industries profit was $220 million in the fourth quarter of 2015, compared with $362 million in the fourth quarter of 2014. The decrease in profit was primarily due to lower sales volume, unfavorable price realization resulting from competitive market conditions and an unfavorable geographic mix of sales, and an unfavorable impact from litigation. The decline was partially offset by favorable manufacturing costs and lower SGA and RD expenses. The reduction in manufacturing costs and SGA and RD expenses was primarily due to lower incentive compensation expense and cost reduction efforts. Resource Industries Resource Industries sales were $1.836 billion in the fourth quarter of 2015, a decrease of $549 million, or 23 percent, from the fourth quarter of 2014. The decline was primarily due to lower sales volume. Sales were lower for both new equipment and aftermarket parts. We believe mining companies are continuing to curtail maintenance and rebuild activities. The sales decrease was primarily due to lower end-user demand across all regions. This was partially offset by the favorable impact of changes in dealer inventories, primarily in Asia/Pacific, as dealer inventories were about flat in the fourth quarter of 2015, compared to a decline in the fourth quarter of 2014. Commodity prices remained weak and mining customers continued to focus on improving productivity in existing mines and reducing their total capital expenditures, as they have for several years. As a result, sales and new orders in Resource Industries continue to be weak. Resource Industries incurred a loss of $105 million in the fourth quarter of 2015, compared with profit of $25 million in the fourth quarter of 2014. The unfavorable change was primarily the result of lower sales volume partially offset by improved manufacturing costs. Manufacturing costs were favorable due to lower period costs resulting from cost reduction efforts and improved material costs. SGA and RD expenses were about flat, as higher spending for new product introductions was about offset by lower SGA expenses. Energy  Transportation Energy  Transportations sales were $4.419 billion in the fourth quarter of 2015, a decrease of $1.772 billion, or 29 percent, from the fourth quarter of 2014. The decrease was primarily the result of lower sales volume and the unfavorable impact of currency, mostly from the euro. Sales decreased in all applications. ##TABLE_START  Oil and Gas - Sales continued to decrease in much of the world due to substantially lower oil prices. The decline was most pronounced in equipment used for well servicing and drilling applications, with the most significant impact in North America, our largest market for well servicing. Demand for reciprocating engines used in gas compression was also down. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Power Generation - Sales decreased in EAME and North America and were about flat in Latin America and Asia/Pacific. In EAME, sales decreased primarily due to the absence of a large project in the fourth quarter of 2014. In North America, sales declined primarily due to the absence of several large projects and unfavorable changes in dealer inventories as dealers decreased inventories in the fourth quarter of 2015 and increased inventories in the fourth quarter of 2014. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Transportation - Sales decreased in North America and were about flat in all other geographic regions. In North America, sales weakened primarily due to the absence of a Tier IV locomotive offering. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Industrial - Sales were lower in all regions. Lower sales in EAME were mostly the result of lower demand and the unfavorable impact of currency. In Asia/Pacific, North America and Latin America, the decline in sales was primarily due to lower end-user demand for most industrial applications primarily due to weak economic conditions. ##TABLE_END Energy  Transportations profit was $712 million in the fourth quarter of 2015, compared with $1.123 billion in the fourth quarter of 2014. The decrease was due to lower sales volume partially offset by lower costs, primarily incentive compensation expense, and favorable product mix due to the absence of the sale of a large power generation project in EAME that was recognized in the fourth quarter of 2014. Financial Products Segment Financial Products revenues were $746 million in the fourth quarter of 2015, a decrease of $65 million, or 8 percent, from the fourth quarter of 2014. The decline was primarily due to lower average earning assets and lower average financing rates. Average earning assets were down in Asia/Pacific, Latin America and EAME, partially offset by higher average earning assets in North America. Average financing rates were down in North America, EAME and Asia/Pacific, partially offset by higher rates in Latin America. Financial Products profit was $191 million in the fourth quarter of 2015, compared with $197 million in the fourth quarter of 2014. The decrease was primarily due to a $17 million unfavorable impact from lower average earning assets, a $10 million decrease in net yield on average earning assets reflecting changes in the geographic mix of margin and currency impacts and a $10 million unfavorable impact from returned or repossessed equipment. These decreases were partially offset by a $24 million increase in gains on sales of securities at Caterpillar Financial Insurance Services and a $12 million decrease in SGA expenses due to lower incentive compensation expense. Corporate Items and Eliminations Expense for corporate items and eliminations was $1.210 billion in the fourth quarter of 2015, an increase of $469 million from the fourth quarter of 2014. Corporate items and eliminations include: corporate-level expenses; restructuring costs; timing differences, as some expenses are reported in segment profit on a cash basis; retirement benefit costs other than service cost; currency differences for MET, as segment profit is reported using annual fixed exchange rates; and inter-segment eliminations. The increase in expense from the fourth quarter of 2014 was primarily due to a $585 million increase in restructuring costs partially offset by timing differences. 2014 COMPARED WITH 2013  CONSOLIDATED SALES AND REVENUES  The chart above graphically illustrates reasons for the change in Consolidated Sales and Revenues between 2013 (at left) and 2014 (at right). Items favorably impacting sales and revenues appear as upward stair steps with the corresponding dollar amounts above each bar, while items negatively impacting sales and revenues appear as downward stair steps with dollar amounts reflected in parentheses above each bar. Caterpillar management utilizes these charts internally to visually communicate with the company's Board of Directors and employees.  Total sales and revenues were $55.184 billion in 2014, down $472 million, or 1 percent, from 2013. Sales volume decreased $680 million primarily due to lower volume in Resource Industries, partially offset by higher volume in Energy  Transportation and Construction Industries. In addition, the impact of currency was unfavorable $237 million primarily due to the Japanese yen and Brazilian real. These unfavorable items were partially offset by improved price realization of $365 million and an increase in Financial Products revenues of $80 million. The volume decrease was primarily the result of lower end-user demand for mining equipment in Resource Industries, as customers reduced their capital expenditures. This unfavorable impact was partially offset by the favorable impact of changes in dealer machine and engine inventories, as dealers decreased inventories about $1 billion in 2014, compared to a decrease of over $3 billion in 2013. In addition, end-user demand increased for Energy  Transportation applications. Dealers are independent, and there could be many reasons for changes in their inventory levels. In general, dealers adjust inventory based on their expectations of future demand and product delivery times. Dealers demand expectations take into account seasonal changes, macroeconomic conditions and other factors. Delivery times can vary based on availability of product from Caterpillar factories and product distribution centers. Aftermarket parts sales were about flat as increases in Energy  Transportation were about offset by declines in Resource Industries. Sales declines in Asia/Pacific and Latin America were nearly offset by increases in North America. In Asia/Pacific, sales decreased 13 percent as a result of lower end-user demand resulting from weak economic conditions. Sales were down in each segment across the region. Sales declined 17 percent in Latin America primarily due to lower end-user demand for mining equipment. Sales increased 12 percent in North America primarily due to higher end-user demand for construction equipment and oil and gas and transportation applications and the favorable impact of dealer inventory changes primarily for construction equipment. Sales were about flat in EAME, as lower end-user demand for mining equipment was about offset by the favorable impact of changes in dealer inventories. While sales in EAME were about flat, sales declines in the CIS were about offset by higher construction equipment sales in Europe due to weak but improving economic conditions. We believe the sales declines in the CIS were due to the effects of ongoing political unrest on economic activity in the region. By segment, sales decreases in Resource Industries were partially offset by increases in Energy  Transportation and Construction Industries. Resource Industries sales declined 24 percent, resulting primarily from weaker demand for mining products, partially offset by the favorable impact of changes in dealer inventories. Energy  Transportations sales were 8 percent higher with increases in all applications. Construction Industries sales increased 4 percent primarily due to the favorable impact of changes in dealer inventories.  CONSOLIDATED OPERATING PROFIT The chart above graphically illustrates reasons for the change in Consolidated Operating Profit between 2013 (at left) and 2014 (at right). Items favorably impacting operating profit appear as upward stair steps with the corresponding dollar amounts above each bar, while items negatively impacting operating profit appear as downward stair steps with dollar amounts reflected in parentheses above each bar. Caterpillar management utilizes these charts internally to visually communicate with the company's Board of Directors and employees. The bar entitled Other includes consolidating adjustments and Machinery, Energy  Transportation other operating (income) expenses.  Operating profit for 2014 was $5.328 billion, compared with $5.628 billion for 2013. The decrease was primarily the result of increased SGA and RD expenses, higher restructuring costs and the absence of a gain related to a settlement in 2013 with the previous owners of Caterpillar (Zhengzhou) Ltd. These unfavorable items were partially offset by improved price realization, primarily for Construction Industries and Energy  Transportation, and lower manufacturing costs. SGA and RD expenses increased $291 million primarily due to higher incentive compensation expense, partially offset by lower retirement benefits costs and decreased program spending. We are focusing on developmental activities in the area of data analytics in an effort to enhance customer productivity. We believe that should we be successful in developing an automated analytics and diagnostics solution that can be utilized across our product line, this will result in a competitive advantage for our company. Our restructuring activities continued in 2014 as part of our ongoing efforts to optimize our cost structure and improve the efficiency of our operations. Restructuring costs for 2014 were $441 million and related to a reduction in workforce at our Gosselies, Belgium, facility and other actions across the company. In 2013, restructuring costs were $200 million. Manufacturing costs improved $104 million primarily due to lower material costs and favorable changes in cost absorption as inventory declined significantly in 2013 as compared to a slight decline in 2014. These favorable impacts were partially offset by higher incentive compensation, increased warranty expenses and the absence of LIFO inventory decrement benefits of $115 million from 2013. Short-term incentive compensation expense related to 2014 was about $1.3 billion. Short-term incentive compensation expense related to 2013 was about $545 million. Other Profit/Loss Items ##TABLE_START  Other income/expense was income of $239 million in 2014, compared with expense of $35 million in 2013. The change was primarily due to the favorable impact of currency translation and hedging gains and losses. Translation and hedging losses in 2013 totaled $254 million. In 2014, translation and hedging gains were $54 million. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  The provision for income taxes for 2014 reflects an effective tax rate of 28 percent compared with 28.5 percent for 2013, excluding the items discussed below. ##TABLE_END The 2014 tax provision also included a benefit of $23 million for the release of a valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets of a non-U.S. subsidiary and a net benefit of $21 million to adjust prior years U.S. taxes and interest. This compares to benefits in 2013 of $87 million primarily related to the U.S. research and development tax credit that was retroactively extended in 2013 for 2012 and $55 million to adjust U.S. taxes from the prior year.

The sales increase was primarily due to higher sales volume and the favorable impact of price realization, partially offset by the unfavorable impact of currency. Sales of new equipment increased slightly, and sales of aftermarket parts were about flat. ##TABLE_START  The increase in sales volume was primarily related to the impact of changes in dealer inventories. Dealer inventories increased slightly in 2014, compared to a decrease in 2013. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  About one-third of the price realization improvement was due to the absence of sales from a large government order in Brazil that started in 2013 and ended in the first half of 2014. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  The unfavorable currency impact was primarily from a weaker Japanese yen, as sales in Japanese yen translated into fewer U.S. dollars. ##TABLE_END Sales increased in North America and EAME, while sales in Asia/Pacific and Latin America were down. ##TABLE_START  In North America, higher sales were primarily due to higher end-user demand resulting from an increase in construction-related spending in the United States. Although still below prior peaks, construction-related spending continues to improve. The remaining sales increase was primarily due to the favorable impact of changes in dealer inventories, as dealers increased inventory in 2014, compared to a decrease in 2013. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  In EAME, higher sales were primarily due to the favorable impact of changes in dealer inventory, partially offset by lower end-user demand. Dealer inventory was about flat in 2014, compared to a decrease in 2013. The decrease in end-user demand was primarily due to lower dealer deliveries to end users in CIS and Africa/Middle East resulting from political unrest, partially offset by increased dealer deliveries to end users in Europe primarily due to weak but improving economic conditions. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Sales decreased in Asia/Pacific primarily in Japan, China and Thailand. In Japan, sales during 2013 were favorably impacted by customer demand in advance of a 2014 emissions change. Sales in Japan also declined due to a weaker Japanese yen as sales in yen translated into fewer U.S. dollars. In China, construction-related spending declined as the overall construction machinery industry decreased approximately 15 percent from 2013. However, dealer deliveries to end users in China have outpaced the industry overall. In Thailand, sales declined as a result of social and political unrest. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Sales declined in Latin America primarily due to lower sales for the large government order in Brazil and lower end-user demand resulting from weaker economic conditions. ##TABLE_END Construction Industries profit was $2.207 billion in 2014, compared with $1.374 billion in 2013. The increase in profit was primarily due to the favorable impact of currency, higher sales volume, improved price realization and lower manufacturing costs. These favorable items were partially offset by increased SGA and RD expenses. Segment profit for 2014 is based on fixed exchange rates set at the beginning of 2014, while segment profit for 2013 is based on fixed exchange rates set at the beginning of 2013. The difference in these fixed exchange rates resulted in a favorable currency impact for the segment. Manufacturing costs improved primarily due to favorable changes in cost absorption resulting from a significantly larger decrease in inventory in 2013 than in 2014. In addition, material costs were lower. These favorable items were partially offset by higher incentive compensation expense. SGA and RD expenses were higher primarily due to increased incentive compensation expense. Resource Industries Resource Industries sales were $8.921 billion for 2014, a decrease of $2.884 billion, or 24 percent, from 2013. The sales volume decline was primarily due to lower end-user demand across all geographic regions. Aftermarket part sales also declined, as we believe some companies are continuing to extend proactive maintenance schedules and delay major overhauls when possible. These declines were partially offset by the favorable impact of changes in dealer inventory. While dealers continued to reduce machine inventories worldwide for 2014, the reductions were less significant than in 2013. Customers in most geographic regions continued to reduce spending across the mining industry. We believe that mining companies are increasing productivity at existing mines and improving their transportation infrastructure rather than investing in expansions or new mine openings, which results in lower demand for our mining products. In addition, projects started in prior years have led to an increased supply of coal and iron ore which has outpaced demand and contributed to prices moving below investment thresholds for those commodities. As a result, new orders for mining equipment continued to be weak in 2014. Resource Industries profit was $404 million for 2014, compared with $1.572 billion for 2013. The decrease was primarily due to lower sales volume, the absence of a $135 million gain related to the settlement with previous owners of Caterpillar (Zhengzhou) Ltd. and unfavorable price realization resulting from a competitive pricing environment. These items were partially offset by an improvement in manufacturing costs and benefits from restructuring actions. The improvement in manufacturing costs was primarily driven by lower material costs and favorable changes in cost absorption. Cost absorption was favorable due to about flat inventory for 2014, compared with a decrease in inventory for 2013. These favorable items were partially offset by higher warranty expense. Energy  Transportation Energy  Transportations sales were $21.727 billion for 2014, an increase of $1.572 billion, or 8 percent, from 2013. The sales increase was primarily due to higher sales volume. In addition, the impact of price realization was favorable, and sales increased in all applications. Sales of aftermarket parts also increased. ##TABLE_START  Oil and Gas - Sales increases in North America and EAME were partially offset by declines in Latin America and Asia/Pacific. In North America, sales increased primarily due to higher demand for equipment used in well servicing, gas compression and drilling applications. In EAME, the sales increase was primarily due to the timing of large projects. Due to the large project nature of many of the Energy  Transportation end markets, the timing of these projects can vary causing volatility in our sales. In Asia/Pacific, sales declines were primarily due to lower sales in Australia resulting from the absence of a large project in 2013. In Latin America, sales declined primarily due to lower end-user demand. ##TABLE_END 44 Caterpillar sells products that are used in a variety of different oil and gas applications, including offshore and land drilling, well servicing, oil and gas production and gas compression. The products we sell to the oil and gas industry include gas turbines and centrifugal natural gas compressors, reciprocating engines, transmissions and well stimulation pumps. About one-third of Energy  Transportations sales in 2014 were related to oil and gas. ##TABLE_START  Transportation - Sales increased in North America and EAME and were about flat in Asia/Pacific and Latin America. Higher sales in North America and EAME were primarily due to increased sales for rail applications. In North America, sales strengthened due to customer demand in advance of the 2015 emissions change for locomotives. In EAME, sales increased as we continued to expand our rail business. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Power Generation - Sales increased in EAME and North America and were about flat in Asia/Pacific and Latin America. Sales improved in EAME primarily due to sales recognition for a large project. In North America, sales increased primarily due to higher end-user demand. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Industrial - Sales into industrial applications increased in North America and were about flat in all other regions. Higher sales in North America were primarily due to higher demand for engines used by original equipment manufacturers for industrial applications. ##TABLE_END Energy  Transportations profit was $4.135 billion for 2014, compared with $3.415 billion for 2013. The increase in profit was primarily due to higher sales volume, which included negative product mix due to sales recognition for a large power generation project in EAME. In addition, price realization improved and material costs were lower. These favorable items were partially offset by higher incentive compensation expense. Financial Products Segment Financial Products revenues were $3.313 billion, an increase of $89 million, or 3 percent, from 2013. The increase was primarily due to higher average earning assets primarily in North America, partially offset by a decrease in Asia/Pacific. This increase was partially offset by the unfavorable impact from lower average financing rates primarily in North America, offset by an increase in Latin America. Financial Products profit was $901 million in 2014, compared with $990 million for 2013. The decrease was primarily due to the absence of $72 million in favorable reserve adjustments at Caterpillar Financial Insurance Services, a $59 million increase in the provision for credit losses at Cat Financial and a $27 million unfavorable impact on interest rate swap contracts. These decreases were partially offset by a $49 million favorable impact from higher average earning assets and a $40 million improvement on net yield on average earning assets. Corporate Items and Eliminations Expense for corporate items and eliminations was $2.891 billion in 2014, an increase of $702 million from 2013. Corporate items and eliminations include: corporate-level expenses; restructuring costs; timing differences, as some expenses are reported in segment profit on a cash basis; retirement benefit costs other than service cost; currency differences for MET, as segment profit is reported using annual fixed exchange rates and inter-segment eliminations. The increase in expense from 2013 was primarily due to timing differences, higher restructuring costs, the unfavorable impact of currency, increased corporate costs, the absence of a LIFO inventory decrement benefit of $115 million and the absence of a gain on a legal settlement of $68 million from 2013. Segment profit for 2014 is based on fixed exchange rates set at the beginning of 2014, while segment profit for 2013 is based on fixed exchange rates set at the beginning of 2013. The difference in actual exchange rates compared with fixed exchange rates is included in corporate items and eliminations and is not reflected in segment profit. These unfavorable items were partially offset by decreased retirement benefit costs and other methodology differences.  RESTRUCTURING COSTS Restructuring costs for 2015, 2014 and 2013 were $908 million, $441 million and $200 million, respectively. The 2015 restructuring costs included $641 million of employee separation costs, $127 million of long-lived asset impairments and $92 million of defined benefit retirement plan curtailment and settlement losses and were recognized in Other operating (income) expense. In addition, in 2015 we incurred costs related to our restructuring programs of $48 million. These costs were primarily for accelerated depreciation and inventory write-downs and were recognized primarily in Cost of goods sold. The 2014 restructuring costs included $382 million of employee separation costs, $48 million of long-lived asset impairments and $11 million of defined benefit retirement plan curtailment and settlement losses. The 2013 restructuring costs included $151 million of employee separation costs, $41 million of long-lived asset impairments and $8 million of other costs. Restructuring costs for 2014 and 2013 were recognized in Other operating (income) expense. The restructuring costs in 2015 were primarily related to several restructuring programs across the company. The restructuring costs in 2014 were primarily related to a reduction in workforce at our Gosselies, Belgium, facility. The most significant charges in 2013 were for the restructuring of management and support functions and the closure or downsizing of several facilities related to our mining business. Restructuring costs are a reconciling item between Segment profit and Consolidated profit before taxes. The following table summarizes the 2014 and 2015 employee separation activity: ##TABLE_START (Millions of dollars) Total Liability balance at December 31, 2013 $ Increase in liability (separation charges) Reduction in liability (payments) (289 ) Liability balance at December 31, 2014 $ Increase in liability (separation charges) Reduction in liability (payments) (340 ) Liability balance at December 31, 2015 $   ##TABLE_END In December 2013, we announced a restructuring plan for our Gosselies, Belgium, facility. This restructuring plan was designed to improve the competitiveness of our European manufacturing footprint and achieve competitiveness in our European operations by refocusing our current Gosselies operations on final machine assembly, test and paint with limited component and fabrication operations. This action includes reshaping our supply base for more efficient sourcing, improving factory efficiencies and workforce reductions and was approved by the Belgian Minister of Employment in February 2014. In 2014, we recognized $273 million of these separation-related charges. In 2015, we recognized $24 million of employee separation costs relating to this restructuring plan. We do not expect any further costs associated with this program. In September 2015, we announced significant restructuring and cost reduction actions to lower our operating costs in response to current economic and business conditions. As part of that announcement, we offered a voluntary retirement enhancement program to qualifying U.S. employees, various voluntary separation programs outside of the U.S. and implemented additional involuntary separation programs throughout the company. We have eliminated approximately 5,000 positions since then, with about 3,000 employees separated by December 31, 2015 and the other 2,100 employees electing to take the voluntary retirement enhancement program in the U.S. and leave the company January 1, 2016. We incurred $379 million of employee separation costs and $86 million of defined benefit retirement plan curtailment losses related to these programs. Substantially all of the employee separation costs related to this program are included in the liability balance above and will be paid in the first quarter of 2016. The remaining liability balance as of December 31, 2015 represents costs for other employee separation programs, most of which are expected to be paid in 2016 .  The remaining restructuring costs incurred during 2015 were primarily related to closure and consolidation of numerous manufacturing facilities throughout the company. Additional restructuring actions are being contemplated including the consolidation and closures of manufacturing facilities occurring through 2018. In total, we expect the cost of these restructuring actions in 2016 to be about $400 million. We expect that restructuring actions will result in a benefit to operating costs, primarily SGA expenses and Cost of goods sold of about $700 million in 2016. GLOSSARY OF TERMS  ##TABLE_START 1.

Funding for these businesses is also available from commercial paper and long-term debt issuances. Financial Products' operations are funded primarily from commercial paper, term debt issuances and collections from its existing portfolio. Despite weaknesses in many of the industries we serve, we had solid operating cash flow in 2015. On a consolidated basis, we ended 2015 with $6.46 billion of cash, a decrease of $881 million from year-end 2014. We intend to maintain a strong cash and liquidity position. Our cash balances are held in numerous locations throughout the world with approximately $5.3 billion held by our non-U.S. subsidiaries. Amounts held by non-U.S. subsidiaries are available for general corporate use. However, if all of the cash held by non-U.S. subsidiaries were repatriated to the United States, a portion would be subject to additional U.S. tax.  Consolidated operating cash flow for 2015 was $6.68 billion down from $8.06 billion in 2014. The decrease was primarily due to lower profit in 2015, which included lower accruals for short-term incentive compensation payments. In addition, unfavorable changes to accounts payable (primarily due to decreased material purchases) as well as higher short-term incentive compensation payments in 2015 unfavorably impacted operating cash flow. Partially offsetting these items were favorable changes to inventory and receivables. See further discussion of operating cash flow under Machinery, Energy  Transportation and Financial Products. Total debt as of December 31, 2015, was $38.09 billion, a decrease of $1.19 billion from year-end 2014. Debt related to Financial Products decreased $710 million, reflecting decreasing portfolio funding requirements. Debt related to Machinery, Energy  Transportation decreased $482 million in 2015, primarily due to the maturity of a long-term debt issuance.  We have three global credit facilities with a syndicate of banks totaling $10.50 billion (Credit Facility) available in the aggregate to both Caterpillar and Cat Financial for general liquidity purposes. Based on management's allocation decision, which can be revised from time to time, the portion of the Credit Facility available to Machinery, Energy  Transportation as of December 31, 2015 was $2.75 billion. Our three Global Credit Facilities are: ##TABLE_START  The 364-day facility of $3.15 billion (of which $0.82 billion is available to Machinery, Energy  Transportation) expires in September 2016. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  The three-year facility, as amended and restated in September 2015, of $2.73 billion (of which $0.72 billion is available to Machinery, Energy  Transportation) expires in September 2018. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  The five-year facility, as amended and restated in September 2015, of $4.62 billion (of which $1.21 billion is available to Machinery, Energy  Transportation) expires in September 2020. ##TABLE_END At December 31, 2015, Caterpillar's consolidated net worth was $19.92 billion, which was above the $9.00 billion required under the Credit Facility. Consolidated net worth is defined as the consolidated stockholder's equity including preferred stock but excluding the pension and other postretirement benefits balance within Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). At December 31, 2015, Cat Financial's covenant interest coverage ratio was 2.05 to 1. This is above the 1.15 to 1 minimum ratio calculated as (1) profit excluding income taxes, interest expense and net gain/(loss) from interest rate derivatives to (2) interest expense calculated at the end of each calendar quarter for the rolling four quarter period then most recently ended, required by the Credit Facility. In addition, at December 31, 2015, Cat Financial's six-month covenant leverage ratio was 7.49 to 1 and year-end covenant leverage ratio was 7.93 to 1. This is below the maximum ratio of debt to net worth of 10 to 1, calculated (1) on a monthly basis as the average of the leverage ratios determined on the last day of each of the six preceding calendar months and (2) at each December 31, required by the Credit Facility. In the event Caterpillar or Cat Financial does not meet one or more of their respective financial covenants under the Credit Facility in the future (and are unable to obtain a consent or waiver), the syndicate of banks may terminate the commitments allocated to the party that does not meet its covenants. Additionally, in such event, certain of Cat Financial's other lenders under other loan agreements where similar financial covenants or cross default provisions are applicable, may, at their election, choose to pursue remedies under those loan agreements, including accelerating the repayment of outstanding borrowings. At December 31, 2015, there were no borrowings under the Credit Facility. Our total credit commitments and available credit as of December 31, 2015 were: ##TABLE_START          December 31, 2015 (Millions of dollars)  Consolidated  Machinery, Energy  Transportation  Financial Products Credit lines available:       Global credit facilities  $ 10,500  $ 2,750  $ 7,750 Other external  3,745   3,569 Total credit lines available  14,245  2,926  11,319 Less: Commercial paper outstanding  (5,811 )    (5,811 ) Less: Utilized credit  (1,444 )  (9 )  (1,435 ) Available credit  $ 6,990  $ 2,917  $ 4,073        ##TABLE_END The other consolidated credit lines with banks as of December 31, 2015 totaled $3.75 billion. These committed and uncommitted credit lines, which may be eligible for renewal at various future dates or have no specified expiration date, are used primarily by our subsidiaries for local funding requirements. Caterpillar or Cat Financial may guarantee subsidiary borrowings under these lines.  In the event that Caterpillar or Cat Financial, or any of their debt securities, experiences a credit rating downgrade, it would likely result in an increase in our borrowing costs and make access to certain credit markets more difficult. In the event economic conditions deteriorate such that access to debt markets becomes unavailable, our Machinery, Energy  Transportation operations would rely on cash flow from operations, use of existing cash balances, borrowings from Cat Financial and access to our Credit Facility. Our Financial Products operations would rely on cash flow from its existing portfolio, existing cash balances, access to our Credit Facility and other credit line facilities of Cat Financial and potential borrowings from Caterpillar. In addition, we maintain a support agreement with Cat Financial, which requires Caterpillar to remain the sole owner of Cat Financial and may, under certain circumstances, require Caterpillar to make payments to Cat Financial should Cat Financial fail to maintain certain financial ratios. Machinery, Energy  Transportation  Net cash provided by operating activities was $5.18 billion in 2015, compared with $7.47 billion in 2014. The decrease was primarily due to lower profit in 2015, which included lower accruals for short-term incentive compensation payments. In addition, unfavorable changes to accounts payable (primarily due to decreased material purchases) as well as higher short-term incentive compensation payments in 2015 unfavorably impacted operating cash flow. Partially offsetting these items were favorable changes to inventory. Inventory decreased in 2015 to a greater degree than the inventory reductions in 2014. We are anticipating that lower sales and our ongoing focus on operational improvements will result in some reduction in inventory in 2016. Net cash used for investing activities in 2015 was $1.78 billion compared with $1.41 billion in 2014. The increase was due to higher spending related to investments and acquisitions in 2015. Net cash used for financing activities in both 2015 and 2014 was $4.24 billion. 2015 financing activities were primarily due to the repurchase of Caterpillar common stock, dividend payments and payments on long-term debt. 2014 financing activities were primarily due to the repurchase of Caterpillar common stock and dividend payments, partially offset by the issuance of long-term debt.  Our priorities for the use of cash are to maintain a strong financial position in support of our credit rating, provide capital to support growth, appropriately fund employee benefit plans, pay dividends and repurchase common stock.  Strong financial position   A key measure of Machinery, Energy  Transportation's financial strength used by both management and our credit rating agencies is Machinery, Energy  Transportation's debt-to-capital ratio. Debt-to-capital is defined as short-term borrowings, long-term debt due within one year and long-term debt due after one year (debt) divided by the sum of debt and stockholders' equity. Debt also includes Machinery, Energy  Transportation borrowings from Financial Products. The debt-to-capital ratio for Machinery, Energy  Transportation was 39.1 percent at December 31, 2015, within our target range of 30 to 45 percent. The Machinery, Energy  Transportation's debt-to-capital ratio was 37.4 percent at December 31, 2014. The increase was primarily due to a return of capital to stockholders of $3.8 billion ($2.0 billion stock repurchase and $1.8 billion dividends) and unfavorable foreign currency translation adjustment to equity of $1.0 billion. These items were partially offset by profit.  Capital to support growth   Capital expenditures during 2015 were $1.63 billion. We expect Machinery, Energy  Transportation capital expenditures in 2016 to be lower than 2015.  Appropriately funded employee benefit plans   During 2015, we made contributions of $30 million to our U.S. defined benefit pension plans and $156 million to our non-U.S. pension plans. We made contributions of $255 million to our U.S. defined benefit pension plans and $265 million to our non-U.S. pension plans in 2014. We expect to make approximately $150 million of required contributions in 2016. We believe we have adequate liquidity resources to fund both U.S. and non-U.S. pension plans.  Paying dividends   Dividends paid totaled $1.76 billion in 2015, representing 70 cents per share paid in the first and second quarters and 77 cents per share in the third and fourth quarters. Each quarter, our Board of Directors reviews the company's dividend for the applicable quarter. The Board evaluates the financial condition of the company and considers the economic outlook, corporate cash flow, the company's liquidity needs and the health and stability of global credit markets to determine whether to maintain or change the quarterly dividend.  Common stock repurchases   In January 2014, the Board of Directors approved an authorization to repurchase up to $10 billion of Caterpillar common stock (the 2014 Authorization), which will expire on December 31, 2018. As of January 1, 2015, $7.50 billion remained available under the 2014 Authorization. In 2015, we repurchased $2.03 billion of Caterpillar common stock, leaving approximately $5.47 billion available under the 2014 Authorization. Caterpillar's basic shares outstanding as of December 31, 2015 were 582 million.  Financial Products  Financial Products operating cash flow was $1.39 billion in 2015, compared with $1.43 billion in 2014. Net cash used for investing activities in 2015 was $1.02 billion, compared with $2.58 billion in 2014. The change was primarily due to lower levels of financing. Net cash used by financing activities in 2015 was $228 million, compared with $770 million net cash provided by financing activities in 2014. The change was primarily due to lower funding requirements for investing activities. ##TABLE_START Dividends paid per common share        Quarter     First  $ .700  $ .600  $  1  Second  .700  .600  .520  Third  .770  .700  .600  Fourth  .770  .700  .600    $ 2.940  $ 2.600  $ 1.720          1 There were two dividend payments of $0.52 per share in the fourth quarter of 2012 due to the acceleration of the fourth quarter dividend payment from January 2013 to December 2012.  ##TABLE_ENDContractual obligations  The company has committed cash outflow related to long-term debt, operating lease agreements, postretirement benefit obligations, purchase obligations, interest on long-term debt and other long-term contractual obligations.

Payment of these obligations would result from settlements with taxing authorities. Due to the difficulty in determining the timing of settlements, these obligations are not included in the table above. We do not expect to make a tax payment related to these obligations within the next year that would significantly impact liquidity. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES  The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts. The more significant estimates include: residual values for leased assets, fair values for goodwill impairment tests, impairment of available-for-sale securities, warranty liability, stock-based compensation, reserves for product liability and insurance losses, postretirement benefits, post-sale discounts, credit losses and income taxes. We have incorporated many years of data into the determination of each of these estimates and we have not historically experienced significant adjustments. These assumptions are reviewed at least annually with the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors. Following are the methods and assumptions used in determining our estimates and an indication of the risks inherent in each.  Residual values for leased assets  The residual values for Cat Financials leased assets, which are an estimate of the market value of leased equipment at the end of the lease term, are based on an analysis of historical wholesale market sales prices, projected forward on a level trend line without consideration for inflation or possible future pricing action. At the inception of the lease, residual values are estimated with consideration of the following critical factors: market size and demand, any known significant market/product trends, total expected hours of usage, machine configuration, application, location, model changes, quantities and past re-marketing experience, third-party residual guarantees and contractual customer purchase options. Many of these factors are gathered in an application survey that is completed prior to quotation. The lease agreement also clearly defines applicable return conditions and remedies for non-compliance, to ensure that the leased equipment will be in good operating condition upon return. Model changes and updates, as well as market strength and product acceptance, are monitored and adjustments are made to residual values in accordance with the significance of any such changes. Remarketing sales staff works closely with customers and dealers to manage the sale of lease returns and the recovery of residual exposure. During the term of the leases, residual values are monitored. If estimated end-of-term market values of leased equipment reflect a non-temporary impairment due to economic factors, obsolescence or other adverse circumstances, the residual value of the leased equipment is adjusted so that the carrying value at end of lease term will approximate the estimated end-of-term market value. For equipment on operating leases, adjustments are made on a straight-line basis over the remaining term of the lease through depreciation expense. For finance leases, adjustments are recognized at the time of assessment through a reduction of finance revenue. At December 31, 2015, the aggregate residual value of equipment on operating leases was $2.09 billion. Without consideration of other factors such as third-party residual guarantees or contractual customer purchase options, a 10% non-temporary decrease in the market value of our equipment subject to operating leases would reduce residual value estimates and result in the recognition of approximately $80 million of additional annual depreciation expense. Fair values for goodwill impairment tests  We test goodwill for impairment annually, at the reporting unit level, and whenever events or circumstances make it likely that an impairment may have occurred, such as a significant adverse change in the business climate or a decision to sell all or a portion of a reporting unit. We perform our annual goodwill impairment test as of October 1 and monitor for interim triggering events on an ongoing basis. Goodwill is reviewed for impairment utilizing either a qualitative assessment or a two-step process. If we choose to perform a qualitative assessment and determine the fair value more likely than not exceeds the carrying value, no further evaluation is necessary. For reporting units where we perform the two-step process, the first step requires us to compare the fair value of each reporting unit, which we primarily determine using an income approach based on the present value of discounted cash flows, to the respective carrying value, which includes goodwill. If the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying value, the goodwill is not considered impaired. If the carrying value is higher than the fair value, there is an indication that an impairment may exist and the second step is required. In step two, the implied fair value of goodwill is calculated as the excess of the fair value of a reporting unit over the fair values assigned to its assets and liabilities. If the implied fair value of goodwill is less than the carrying value of the reporting unit's goodwill, the difference is recognized as an impairment loss. The impairment test process requires valuation of the respective reporting unit, which we primarily determine using an income approach based on a discounted five year forecasted cash flow with a year-five residual value. The residual value is computed using the constant growth method, which values the forecasted cash flows in perpetuity. The income approach is supported by a reconciliation of our calculated fair value for Caterpillar to the company's market capitalization. The assumptions about future cash flows and growth rates are based on each reporting unit's long-term forecast and are subject to review and approval by senior management. A reporting units discount rate is a risk-adjusted weighted average cost of capital, which we believe approximates the rate from a market participant's perspective. The estimated fair value could be impacted by changes in market conditions, interest rates, growth rates, tax rates, costs, pricing and capital expenditures. Annual impairment tests, completed in the fourth quarter of 2015, indicated the fair value of each reporting unit was substantially above its respective carrying value, including goodwill, except as noted in the following paragraph. Caterpillar's market capitalization has remained significantly above the net book value of the Company. Our Resource Industries segment has two reporting units with goodwill largely from our acquisition of Bucyrus International, Inc. in 2011: Hauling  Extraction with goodwill of approximately $1.7 billion and Material Handling  Underground with goodwill of approximately $1.9 billion. Hauling  Extractions product portfolio primarily includes large mining trucks, electric rope shovels, draglines, hydraulic shovels, off-highway trucks, wheel tractor scrapers and related parts. Material Handling  Undergrounds product portfolio primarily includes large track-type tractors, hard rock vehicles, longwall miners, track and rotary drills, highwall miners, large wheel loaders, articulated trucks, wheel dozers, scoops and haulers, continuous miners, hardrock continuous mining systems and related parts. Our equipment is used to extract and haul copper, iron ore, coal, oil sands, aggregates, gold and other minerals and ores. The demand for our equipment and related parts is highly cyclical and significantly impacted by commodity prices, although the impact may vary by reporting unit. Weakness in current economic conditions and in the mining industry have caused the October 1, 2015 fair values of these two reporting units to decline from previous periods as our future cash flow forecasts and growth rates have been reduced. We expect Resource Industries sales to decline about 15 to 20 percent in 2016 compared to 2015 as a result of continuing reductions in mining-related commodity prices and difficult financial conditions for many mining customers around the world. We expect Resource Industries sales and cash flows to improve over the remainder of the five year forecast period. Based on our estimates for long-term growth, profits and cash flows, the fair values of both Hauling  Extraction and Material Handling  Underground have remained greater than their respective carrying values. The fair value of the Hauling  Extraction reporting unit exceeds its carrying value by approximately 15 percent. The fair value of Material Handling  Underground remains substantially above its carrying value. An unfavorable change in our expectations for the financial performance of our reporting units, particularly long-term growth and profitability, would reduce the fair value of our reporting units. The energy and mining industries are major users of our products, including the coal, iron ore, gold, copper, oil and natural gas industries. Decisions to purchase our products are dependent upon the performance of those industries, which in turn are dependent in part on commodity prices. Lower commodity prices or industry specific circumstances that have a negative impact to the valuation assumptions may reduce the fair value of our reporting units. Should such events occur and it becomes more likely than not that a reporting unit's fair value has fallen below its carrying value, we will perform an interim goodwill impairment test(s), in addition to the annual impairment test. Future impairment tests may result in a goodwill impairment, depending on the outcome of both step one and step two of the impairment review process. A goodwill impairment would be reported as a non-cash charge to earnings.  Impairment of available-for-sale securities   Available-for-sale securities, primarily at Insurance Services, are reviewed at least quarterly to identify fair values below cost which may indicate that a security is impaired and should be written down to fair value.  For debt securities, once a securitys fair value is below cost we utilize data gathered by investment managers, external sources and internal research to monitor the performance of the security to determine whether an other-than-temporary impairment has occurred. These reviews, which include an analysis of whether it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before its anticipated recovery, consist of both quantitative and qualitative analysis and require a degree of management judgment. Securities in a loss position are monitored and assessed at least quarterly based on severity and timing of loss and may be deemed other-than-temporarily impaired at any time. Once a securitys fair value has been 20 percent or more below its original cost for six consecutive months, the security will be other-than-temporarily impaired unless there are sufficient facts and circumstances supporting otherwise.  For equity securities in a loss position, determining whether a security is other-than-temporarily impaired requires an analysis of that security's historical sector return as well as the volatility of that return. This information is utilized to estimate a securitys future fair value and to assess whether the security has the ability to recover to its original cost over a reasonable period of time. Both historical annualized sector returns and the volatility of those returns are applied over a two year period to arrive at these estimates. For both debt and equity securities, qualitative factors are also considered in determining whether a security is other-than-temporarily impaired. These include reviews of the following: significant changes in the regulatory, economic or technological environment of the investee, significant changes in the general market condition of either the geographic area or the industry in which the investee operates, and length of time and the extent to which the fair value has been less than cost. These qualitative factors are subjective and require a degree of management judgment.  Warranty liability  At the time a sale is recognized, we record estimated future warranty costs. The warranty liability is determined by applying historical claim rate experience to the current field population and dealer inventory. Generally, historical claim rates are based on actual warranty experience for each product by machine model/engine size by customer or dealer location (inside or outside North America). Specific rates are developed for each product shipment month and are updated monthly based on actual warranty claim experience. Warranty costs may differ from those estimated if actual claim rates are higher or lower than our historical rates.  Stock-based compensation  We use a lattice-based option-pricing model to calculate the fair value of our stock options and SARs. The calculation of the fair value of the awards using the lattice-based option-pricing model is affected by our stock price on the date of grant as well as assumptions regarding the following:  ##TABLE_START  Volatility is a measure of the amount by which the stock price is expected to fluctuate each year during the expected term of the award and is based on historical Caterpillar stock price movement and current implied volatilities from traded ##TABLE_END 54 options on Caterpillar stock. The implied volatilities from traded options are impacted by changes in market conditions. An increase in the volatility would result in an increase in our expense. ##TABLE_START  The expected term represents the period of time that awards granted are expected to be outstanding and is an output of the lattice-based option-pricing model. In determining the expected term of the award, future exercise and forfeiture patterns are estimated from Caterpillar employee historical exercise behavior. These patterns are also affected by the vesting conditions of the award. Changes in the future exercise behavior of employees or in the vesting period of the award could result in a change in the expected term. An increase in the expected term would result in an increase to our expense. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  The weighted-average dividend yield is based on Caterpillars historical dividend yields. As holders of stock options and SARs do not receive dividend payments, this could result in employees retaining the award for a longer period of time if dividend yields decrease or exercising the award sooner if dividend yields increase. A decrease in the dividend yield would result in an increase in our expense. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  The risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at time of grant. As the risk-free interest rate increases, the expected term increases, resulting in an increase in our expense. ##TABLE_END  The fair value of our RSUs and PRSUs is determined by reducing the stock price on the date of grant by the present value of the estimated dividends to be paid during the vesting period. The estimated dividends are based on Caterpillars quarterly dividend per share at the time of grant. A decrease in the dividend per share would result in an increase in our expense.  Stock-based compensation expense recognized during the period is based on the value of the number of awards that are expected to vest. In determining the stock-based compensation expense to be recognized, a forfeiture rate is applied to the fair value of the award. This rate represents the number of awards that are expected to be forfeited prior to vesting and is based on Caterpillar employee historical behavior. Changes in the future behavior of employees could impact this rate. A decrease in this rate would result in an increase in our expense.  Product liability and insurance loss reserve  We determine these reserves based upon reported claims in process of settlement and actuarial estimates for losses incurred but not reported. Loss reserves, including incurred but not reported reserves, are based on estimates and ultimate settlements may vary significantly from such estimates due to increased claims frequency or severity over historical levels.  Postretirement benefits  Primary actuarial assumptions were determined as follows:  ##TABLE_START  The U.S. expected long-term rate of return on plan assets is based on our estimate of long-term passive returns for equities and fixed income securities weighted by the allocation of our plan assets. Based on historical performance, we increase the passive returns due to our active management of the plan assets. A similar process is used to determine the rate for our non-U.S. pension plans. This rate is impacted by changes in general market conditions, but because it represents a long-term rate, it is not significantly impacted by short-term market swings. Changes in our allocation of plan assets would also impact this rate. For example, a shift to more fixed income securities would lower the rate. A decrease in the rate would increase our expense. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  The assumed discount rate is used to discount future benefit obligations back to todays dollars. The U.S. discount rate is based on a benefit cash flow-matching approach and represents the rate at which our benefit obligations could effectively be settled as of our measurement date, December 31. The benefit cash flow-matching approach involves analyzing Caterpillars projected cash flows against a high quality bond yield curve, calculated using a wide population of corporate Aa bonds available on the measurement date. The very highest and lowest yielding bonds (top and bottom 10 percent) are excluded from the analysis. A similar approach is used to determine the assumed discount rate for our most significant non-U.S. plans. This rate is sensitive to changes in interest rates. A decrease in the discount rate would increase our obligation and future expense. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  The expected rate of compensation increase is used to develop benefit obligations using projected pay at retirement. It represents average long-term salary increases. This rate is influenced by our long-term compensation policies. An increase in the rate would increase our obligation and expense. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  The assumed health care trend rate represents the rate at which health care costs are assumed to increase and is based on historical and expected experience. Changes in our projections of future health care costs due to general economic conditions and those specific to health care (e.g., technology driven cost changes) will impact this trend rate. An increase in the trend rate would increase our obligation and expense. ##TABLE_END The effects of actual results differing from our assumptions and the effects of changing assumptions are considered actuarial gains or losses. Actuarial gains or losses are recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). When the unamortized actuarial gains or losses for an individual plan exceed 10 percent of the higher of the projected benefit obligation or 10 percent of market-related value of plans assets at the beginning of the year, the excess is amortized as a component of net periodic benefit cost using the straight-line method. The amortization period is generally the average remaining service period of active employees expected to receive benefits from the plan. For plans in which all or almost all of the plans participants are inactive, actuarial gains or losses are amortized over the remaining life expectancy of the inactive participants. See Retirement Benefits section for a discussion of changes in accounting for retirement benefits.  Post-sale discount reserve  We provide discounts to dealers through merchandising programs. We have numerous programs that are designed to promote the sale of our products. The most common dealer programs provide a discount when the dealer sells a product to a targeted end user. The amount of accrued post-sale discounts was $1,191 million and $1,273 million as of December 31, 2015 and 2014 , respectively. The reserve represents discounts that we expect to pay on previously sold units and is reviewed at least quarterly. The reserve is adjusted if discounts paid differ from those estimated. Historically, those adjustments have not been material.  Credit loss reserve - The allowance for credit losses is an estimate of the losses inherent in our finance receivable portfolio and includes consideration of accounts that have been individually identified as impaired, as well as pools of finance receivables where it is probable that certain receivables in the pool are impaired but the individual accounts cannot yet be identified. In identifying and measuring impairment, management takes into consideration past loss experience, known and inherent risks in the portfolio, adverse situations that may affect the borrowers ability to repay, estimated value of underlying collateral and current economic conditions. Accounts are identified for individual review based on past-due status and information available about the customer, such as financial statements, news reports and published credit ratings, as well as general information regarding industry trends and the economic environment in which our customers operate. The allowance for credit losses attributable to finance receivables that are individually evaluated and determined to be impaired is based either on the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the receivables effective interest rate or the fair value of the collateral for collateral-dependent receivables. In determining collateral value, we estimate the current fair market value of the collateral less selling costs. We also consider credit enhancements such as additional collateral and contractual third-party guarantees. The allowance for credit losses attributable to the remaining accounts not yet individually identified as impaired is estimated based on loss forecast models utilizing probabilities of default, our estimate of the loss emergence period and the estimated loss given default. In addition, qualitative factors not able to be fully captured in our loss forecast models including industry trends, macroeconomic factors and model imprecision are considered in the evaluation of the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses. These qualitative factors are subjective and require a degree of management judgment. While management believes it has exercised prudent judgment and applied reasonable assumptions, there can be no assurance that in the future, changes in economic conditions or other factors would not cause changes in the financial health of our customers. If the financial health of our customers deteriorates, the timing and level of payments received could be impacted and therefore, could result in a change to our estimated losses. Income taxes  We are subject to the income tax laws of the many jurisdictions in which we operate. These tax laws are complex, and the manner in which they apply to our facts is sometimes open to interpretation. In establishing the provision for income taxes, we must make judgments about the application of these inherently complex tax laws.  Despite our belief that our tax return positions are consistent with applicable tax laws, we believe that taxing authorities could challenge certain positions. Settlement of any challenge can result in no change, a complete disallowance, or some partial adjustment reached through negotiations or litigation. We record tax benefits for uncertain tax positions based upon managements evaluation of the information available at the reporting date. To be recognized in the financial statements, a tax benefit must be at least more likely than not of being sustained based on technical merits. The benefit for positions meeting the recognition threshold is measured as the largest benefit more likely than not of being realized upon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information. Significant judgment is required in making these determinations and adjustments to unrecognized tax benefits may be necessary to reflect actual taxes payable upon settlement. Adjustments related to positions impacting the effective tax rate affect the provision for income taxes. Adjustments related to positions impacting the timing of deductions impact deferred tax assets and liabilities.  Our income tax positions and analysis are based on currently enacted tax law. Future changes in tax law could significantly impact the provision for income taxes, the amount of taxes payable, and the deferred tax asset and liability balances. Deferred tax assets generally represent tax benefits for tax deductions or credits available in future tax returns. Certain estimates and assumptions are required to determine whether it is more likely than not that all or some portion of the benefit of a deferred tax asset will not be realized. In making this assessment, management analyzes and estimates the impact of future taxable income, reversing temporary differences and available prudent and feasible tax planning strategies. Should a change in facts or circumstances lead to a change in judgment about the ultimate realizability of a deferred tax asset, we record or adjust the related valuation allowance in the period that the change in facts and circumstances occurs, along with a corresponding increase or decrease in the provision for income taxes.  A provision for U.S. income taxes has not been recorded on undistributed profits of our non-U.S. subsidiaries that we have determined to be indefinitely reinvested outside the U.S. If management intentions or U.S. tax law changes in the future, there may be a significant negative impact on the provision for income taxes to record an incremental tax liability in the period the change occurs. A deferred tax asset is recognized only if we have definite plans to generate a U.S. tax benefit by repatriating earnings in the foreseeable future. Income taxes are based on the statutory tax rate of the jurisdiction in which earnings are subject to taxation. That statutory rate may differ from the statutory tax rate of the jurisdiction in which that entity is incorporated. Taxes are paid in the jurisdictions where earnings are subject to taxation. The effective tax rate differs from the U.S. statutory rate in part due to indefinitely reinvested profits of non-U.S. subsidiaries being subject to statutory tax rates which are generally lower than the U.S. rate of 35 percent. The indefinitely reinvested profits of Caterpillar SARL (CSARL), primarily taxable in Switzerland, contribute the most significant amount of this difference. On January 30, 2015, we received a Revenue Agent's Report (RAR) from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) indicating the end of the field examination of our U.S. income tax returns for 2007 to 2009 including the impact of a loss carryback to 2005. The IRS has proposed to tax in the United States profits earned from certain parts transactions by CSARL based on the IRS examination teams application of substance-over-form or assignment-of-income judicial doctrines. We are vigorously contesting this adjustment through the IRS appeals process. We believe that the relevant transactions complied with applicable tax laws and did not violate judicial doctrines. The purchase of parts by CSARL from unrelated parties and the subsequent sale of those parts to unrelated dealers outside the United States have substantial legal, commercial, and economic consequences for the parties involved. We have filed U.S. income tax returns on this same basis for years after 2009. We currently believe the ultimate disposition of this matter will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position, liquidity or results of operations. OTHER MATTERS  ENVIRONMENTAL AND LEGAL MATTERS The Company is regulated by federal, state and international environmental laws governing our use, transport and disposal of substances and control of emissions. In addition to governing our manufacturing and other operations, these laws often impact the development of our products, including, but not limited to, required compliance with air emissions standards applicable to internal combustion engines. We have made, and will continue to make, significant research and development and capital expenditures to comply with these emissions standards. We are engaged in remedial activities at a number of locations, often with other companies, pursuant to federal and state laws. When it is probable we will pay remedial costs at a site, and those costs can be reasonably estimated, the investigation, remediation, and operating and maintenance costs are accrued against our earnings. Costs are accrued based on consideration of currently available data and information with respect to each individual site, including available technologies, current applicable laws and regulations, and prior remediation experience. Where no amount within a range of estimates is more likely, we accrue the minimum. Where multiple potentially responsible parties are involved, we consider our proportionate share of the probable costs. In formulating the estimate of probable costs, we do not consider amounts expected to be recovered from insurance companies or others. We reassess these accrued amounts on a quarterly basis. The amount recorded for environmental remediation is not material and is included in Accrued expenses. We believe there is no more than a remote chance that a material amount for remedial activities at any individual site, or at all the sites in the aggregate, will be required. On January 8, 2015, the Company received a grand jury subpoena from the U.S. District Court for the Central District of Illinois. The subpoena requests documents and information from the Company relating to, among other things, financial information concerning U.S. and non-U.S. Caterpillar subsidiaries (including undistributed profits of non-U.S. subsidiaries and the movement of cash among U.S. and non-U.S. subsidiaries). The Company has received additional subpoenas relating to this investigation requesting additional documents and information relating to, among other things, the purchase and resale of replacement parts by Caterpillar Inc. and non-U.S. Caterpillar subsidiaries, dividend distributions of certain non-U.S. Caterpillar subsidiaries, and Caterpillar SARL and related structures. The Company is cooperating with this investigation. The Company is unable to predict the outcome or reasonably estimate any potential loss; however, we currently believe that this matter will not have a material adverse effect on the Companys consolidated results of operations, financial position or liquidity. On September 12, 2014, the SEC notified the Company that it was conducting an informal investigation relating to Caterpillar SARL and related structures. On December 8, 2015, the Company was notified by the SEC that it concluded its investigation relating to Caterpillar SARL and related structures and that it did not intend to recommend an enforcement action. On September 10, 2014, the SEC issued to Caterpillar a subpoena seeking information concerning the Companys accounting for the goodwill relating to its acquisition of Bucyrus International Inc. in 2011 and related matters. The Company has received additional subpoenas relating to this investigation, and the Company is cooperating with the SEC regarding its ongoing investigation. The Company is unable to predict the outcome or reasonably estimate any potential loss; however, we currently believe that this matter will not have a material adverse effect on the Company's consolidated results of operations, financial position or liquidity. On March 20, 2014, Brazils Administrative Council for Economic Defense (CADE) published a Technical Opinion which named 18 companies and over 100 individuals as defendants, including two subsidiaries of Caterpillar Inc., MGE - Equipamentos e Servios Ferrovirios Ltda. (MGE) and Caterpillar Brasil Ltda. The publication of the Technical Opinion opened CADE's official administrative investigation into allegations that the defendants participated in anticompetitive bid activity for the construction and maintenance of metro and train networks in Brazil. While companies cannot be held criminally liable for anticompetitive conduct in Brazil, criminal charges have been brought against two current employees of MGE and one former employee of MGE involving the same conduct alleged by CADE. The Company has responded to all requests for information from the authorities. The Company is unable to predict the outcome or reasonably estimate the potential loss; however, we currently believe that this matter will not have a material adverse effect on the Company's consolidated results of operations, financial position or liquidity. On October 24, 2013, Progress Rail received a grand jury subpoena from the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California. The subpoena requests documents and information from Progress Rail, United Industries Corporation, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Progress Rail, and Caterpillar Inc. relating to allegations that Progress Rail conducted improper or unnecessary railcar inspections and repairs and improperly disposed of parts, equipment, tools and other items. In connection with this subpoena, Progress Rail was informed by the U.S. Attorney for the Central District of California that it is a target of a criminal investigation into potential violations of environmental laws and alleged improper business practices. The Company is cooperating with the authorities and is currently in discussions regarding a potential resolution of the matter. Although the Company believes a loss is probable, we currently believe that this matter will not have a material adverse effect on the Company's consolidated results of operations, financial position or liquidity. In addition, we are involved in other unresolved legal actions that arise in the normal course of business. The most prevalent of these unresolved actions involve disputes related to product design, manufacture and performance liability (including claimed asbestos and welding fumes exposure), contracts, employment issues, environmental matters or intellectual property rights. The aggregate range of reasonably possible losses in excess of accrued liabilities, if any, associated with these unresolved legal actions is not material. In some cases, we cannot reasonably estimate a range of loss because there is insufficient information regarding the matter. However, we believe there is no more than a remote chance that any liability arising from these matters would be material. Although it is not possible to predict with certainty the outcome of these unresolved legal actions, we believe that these actions will not individually or in the aggregate have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations, financial position or liquidity.  RETIREMENT BENEFITS  We recognized pension expense of $562 million in 2015 as compared to $465 million in 2014. The increase in expense was primarily due to higher amortization of net actuarial losses primarily due to lower discount rates at the end of 2014 (reflected in 2015 expense) compared to the end of 2013 (reflected in 2014 expense) and changes to our U.S. mortality assumption. In addition, the 2015 expense includes $52 million of curtailment expense related to the voluntary retirement enhancement program that was offered in 2015 to qualifying U.S. employees. The increase in expense was partially offset by lower interest costs. At the end of 2015, total actuarial losses recognized in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) for pension plans were $7.55 billion, as compared to $7.53 billion in 2014. The majority of the actuarial losses are due to changes in discount rates, losses from demographic assumptions over the past several years and plan asset losses. In the fourth quarter of 2014, the mortality assumption for our U.S. pension and other postretirement benefit plans was reviewed to consider the use of new tables that were released by the Society of Actuaries. As of December 31, 2014, the company adopted the new tables with modifications to reflect historical company specific mortality experience and its best estimate of future mortality improvements. The adoption of the new tables resulted in an increase in the life expectancy of plan participants and therefore an increase in our Liability for postemployment benefits of approximately $400 million. In 2015, we recognized other postretirement benefit expense of $259 million compared to $227 million in 2014. The increase in expense was primarily due to $34 million of curtailment expense related to the U.S. voluntary retirement enhancement program. At the end of 2015 total actuarial losses recognized in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) for other postretirement benefit plans were $171 million as compared to $800 million in 2014. These losses mainly reflect the impact of discount rates, changes in our health care trend assumption and plan asset losses, partially offset by gains from lower than expected health care costs. The decrease from 2014 to 2015 was primarily the result of gains from lower than expected health care costs, increase in the discount rates and amortization of net actuarial losses into earnings during 2015. At December 31, 2015, we changed our method for calculating the service and interest cost components of net periodic benefit cost. Historically, these components were determined utilizing a single weighted-average discount rate based on a yield curve used to measure the benefit obligation at the beginning of the period. Beginning in 2016, we have elected to utilize a full yield curve approach in the estimation of the service and interest costs by applying the specific spot rates along the yield curve used in the determination of the benefit obligation to the relevant projected cash flows. We have made this change to provide a more precise measurement of service and interest costs by improving the correlation between the projected cash flows to the corresponding spot rates along the yield curve. Compared to the method used in 2015, we expect this change to result in lower pension and other postretirement benefit expense of approximately $180 million in 2016 before considering the change in accounting principle discussed in the paragraph below. This change will have no impact on pension and other postretirement benefit liabilities and will be accounted for prospectively as a change in accounting estimate. At January 1, 2016, we changed our accounting principle for recognizing actuarial gains and losses and expected return on plan assets for our pension and other postretirement benefit plans to a more preferable policy under U.S. GAAP. Prior to 2016, actuarial gains and losses were recognized as a component of Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), and were generally amortized into earnings in future periods. Under the new principle, actuarial gains and losses will be immediately recognized through earnings upon the annual remeasurement in the fourth quarter, or on an interim basis as triggering events warrant remeasurement. In addition, we changed our policy for recognizing expected returns on plan assets from a market-related value method (based on a three-year smoothing of asset returns) to a fair value method. We believe that these changes are preferable as they provide greater transparency of our economic obligations in accounting results and better align with the fair value accounting principles by recognizing the effects of economic and interest rate changes on pension and other postretirement benefit assets and liabilities in the year in which the gains and losses are incurred. These changes will be applied retrospectively to prior years. We are currently determining the impact on prior years and will provide that information later in 2016. Excluding any gains or losses from remeasurement, we currently estimate this change will reduce our 2016 pension and other postretirement benefit expense by approximately $425 million and the estimated impact on 2015 is a reduction in expense of approximately $575 million. As the change to the use of specific spot rates for calculating the service and interest cost component of our pension and other postretirement benefit cost does not impact the measurement of benefit liabilities, the related change in service and interest costs will be offset in the gains or losses reported when benefit plans are remeasured. Prior to making these changes, we would have expected our total pension and other postretirement benefit expense to decrease approximately $230 million in 2016 which would have been primarily due to a decrease in amortization of net actuarial losses. In general, our strategy for both the U.S. and the non-U.S. pensions includes further aligning our investments to our liabilities, while reducing risk in our portfolio. For our U.S. pension plans, our year-end 2015 asset allocation was 46 percent equity securities, 51 percent fixed income securities and 3 percent other. Our current U.S. pension target asset allocations is 45 percent equity and 55 percent fixed income. The target allocations will be revisited periodically to ensure that they reflect our overall objectives. The U.S. plans are rebalanced to plus or minus 5 percentage points of the target asset allocation ranges on a monthly basis. The year-end 2015 asset allocation for our non-U.S. pension plans was 41 percent equity securities, 52 percent fixed income securities, 4 percent real estate and 3 percent other. The 2015 target allocation for our non-U.S. pension plans was 41 percent equity securities, 51 percent fixed income securities, 5 percent real estate and 3 percent other. The target allocations for each plan vary based upon local statutory requirements, demographics of the plan participants and funded status. The frequency of rebalancing for the non-U.S. plans varies depending on the plan. The use of certain derivative instruments is permitted where appropriate and necessary for achieving overall investment policy objectives. The plans do not engage in derivative contracts for speculative purposes.  During 2015, we made contributions of $30 million to our U.S. defined benefit pension plans and $156 million to our non-U.S. pension plans. We made contributions of $255 million to our U.S. defined benefit pension plans and $265 million to our non-U.S. pension plans in 2014. We expect to make approximately $150 million of required contributions in 2016. We believe we have adequate liquidity resources to fund both U.S. and non-U.S. pension plans.  Actuarial assumptions have a significant impact on both pension and other postretirement benefit expenses. The effects of a one percentage point change in our primary actuarial assumptions on 2015 benefit costs and year-end obligations are included in the table below. ##TABLE_START      ##TABLE_ENDPostretirement Benefit Plan Actuarial Assumptions Sensitivity  Following are the effects of a one percentage-point change in our primary pension and other postretirement benefit actuarial assumptions (included in the following table) on 2015 pension and other postretirement benefits costs and obligations:  ##TABLE_START   2015 Benefit Cost  Year-end Benefit Obligation (Millions of dollars)  One percentage- point increase  One percentage- point decrease  One percentage- point increase  One percentage- point decrease Pension benefits:         Assumed discount rate  $ (201 )  $  $ (2,320 )  $ 2,874 Expected rate of compensation increase   (31 )   (155 ) Expected long-term rate of return on plan assets  (158 )      Other postretirement benefits:         Assumed discount rate  (40 )   (418 )  Expected rate of compensation increase       (1 ) Expected long-term rate of return on plan assets  (7 )      Assumed health care cost trend rate   (45 )   (202 )          ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START Primary Actuarial Assumptions                      U.S. Pension Benefits  Non-U.S. Pension Benefits  Other Postretirement Benefits           Weighted-average assumptions used to determine benefit obligations, end of year:                   Discount rate  4.2 %  3.8 %  4.6 %  3.2 %  3.3 %  4.1 %  4.1 %  3.9 %  4.6 % Rate of compensation increase  4.0 %  4.0 %  4.0 %  3.8 %  4.0 %  4.2 %  4.0 %  4.0 %  4.0 %                    Weighted-average assumptions used to determine net cost:                   Discount rate  3.8 %  4.6 %  3.7 %  3.3 %  4.1 %  3.7 %  3.9 %  4.6 %  3.7 % Expected rate of return on plan assets  7.4 %  7.8 %  7.8 %  6.8 %  6.9 %  6.8 %  7.8 %  7.8 %  7.8 % Rate of compensation increase  4.0 %  4.0 %  4.5 %  4.0 %  4.2 %  3.9 %  4.0 %  4.0 %  4.4 %                    Health care cost trend rates at year-end:                   Health care trend rate assumed for next year  6.5 %  6.6 %  6.6 % Rate that the cost trend rate gradually declines to  5.0 %  5.0 %  5.0 % Year that the cost trend rate reaches ultimate rate                       ##TABLE_ENDSENSITIVITY  Foreign Exchange Rate Sensitivity  Machinery, Energy  Transportation use foreign currency forward and option contracts to manage unmatched foreign currency cash inflow and outflow. Our objective is to minimize the risk of exchange rate movements that would reduce the U.S. dollar value of our foreign currency cash flow. Our policy allows for managing anticipated foreign currency cash flow for up to five years. Based on the anticipated and firmly committed cash inflow and outflow for our Machinery, Energy  Transportation operations for the next 12 months and the foreign currency derivative instruments in place at year-end, a hypothetical 10 percent weakening of the U.S. dollar relative to all other currencies would adversely affect our expected 2016 cash flow for our Machinery, Energy  Transportation operations by approximately $318 million. Last year similar assumptions and calculations yielded a potential $362 million adverse impact on 2015 cash flow. We determine our net exposures by calculating the difference in cash inflow and outflow by currency and adding or subtracting outstanding foreign currency derivative instruments. We multiply these net amounts by 10 percent to determine the sensitivity.  Since our policy for Financial Products operations is to hedge the foreign exchange risk when the currency of our debt portfolio does not match the currency of our receivable portfolio, a 10 percent change in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to all other currencies would not have a material effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flow. Neither our policy nor the effect of a 10 percent change in the value of the U.S. dollar has changed from that reported at the end of last year. The effect of the hypothetical change in exchange rates ignores the effect this movement may have on other variables, including competitive risk. If it were possible to quantify this competitive impact, the results would probably be different from the sensitivity effects shown above. In addition, it is unlikely that all currencies would uniformly strengthen or weaken relative to the U.S. dollar. In reality, some currencies may weaken while others may strengthen. Our primary exposure (excluding competitive risk) is to exchange rate movements in the Chinese yuan, euro, Japanese yen, Australian dollar and British pound.  Interest Rate Sensitivity  For our Machinery, Energy  Transportation operations, we have the option to use interest rate swaps to lower the cost of borrowed funds by attaching fixed-to-floating interest rate swaps to fixed-rate debt, and by entering into forward rate agreements on future debt issuances. A hypothetical 100 basis point adverse move in interest rates along the entire interest rate yield curve would have a minimal impact to the 2016 pre-tax earnings of Machinery, Energy  Transportation. Last year, similar assumptions and calculations yielded a minimal impact to 2015 pre-tax earnings.  For our Financial Products operations, we use interest rate derivative instruments primarily to meet our match-funding objectives and strategies. We have a match-funding policy whereby the interest rate profile (fixed or floating rate) of our debt portfolio is matched to the interest rate profile of our earning asset portfolio (finance receivables and operating leases) within certain parameters. In connection with that policy, we use interest rate swap agreements to modify the debt structure. Match funding assists us in maintaining our interest rate spreads, regardless of the direction interest rates move.  In order to properly manage sensitivity to changes in interest rates, Financial Products measures the potential impact of different interest rate assumptions on pre-tax earnings. All on-balance sheet positions, including derivative financial instruments, are included in the analysis. The primary assumptions included in the analysis are that there are no new fixed rate assets or liabilities, the proportion of fixed rate debt to fixed rate assets remains unchanged and the level of floating rate assets and debt remain constant. An analysis of the December 31, 2015 balance sheet, using these assumptions, estimates the impact of a 100 basis point immediate and sustained adverse change in interest rates to have a potential $13 million adverse impact on pre-tax earnings. Last year, similar assumptions and calculations yielded a potential $5 million adverse impact to 2015 pre-tax earnings.  This analysis does not necessarily represent our current outlook of future market interest rate movement, nor does it consider any actions management could undertake in response to changes in interest rates. Accordingly, no assurance can be given that actual results would be consistent with the results of our estimate. NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES The following definitions are provided for the non-GAAP financial measures used in this report. These non-GAAP financial measures have no standardized meaning prescribed by U.S. GAAP and therefore are unlikely to be comparable to the calculation of similar measures for other companies. Management does not intend these items to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the related GAAP measures. We have incurred significant restructuring costs in 2015. We believe it is important to separately quantify the profit-per-share impact of restructuring costs in order for our results to be meaningful to our readers as these costs are incurred in the current year to generate longer term benefits. We have also provided 2014 profit per share excluding restructuring costs comparable to the 2015 presentation. Reconciliation of profit per share excluding restructuring costs to the most directly comparable GAAP measure, profit per share - diluted is as follows: ##TABLE_START   Three Months Ended December 31,  Twelve Months Ended December 31,      Profit per share - diluted  $ (0.15 )  $ 1.23  $ 3.50  $ 5.88 Per share restructuring costs 1  $ 0.89  $ 0.12  $ 1.14  $ 0.50 Profit per share excluding restructuring costs  $ 0.74  $ 1.35  $ 4.64  $ 6.38          1 At effective tax rate excluding discrete items.                  ##TABLE_ENDSupplemental Consolidating Data  We are providing supplemental consolidating data for the purpose of additional analysis.

(company) is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act. Our internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of our financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Our internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.  Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.  Management assessed the effectiveness of the companys internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2015 . In making this assessment, we used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework (2013). Based on our assessment we concluded that, as of December 31, 2015 , the companys internal control over financial reporting was effective based on those criteria.  The effectiveness of the companys internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2015 has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm. Their report appears on page 68.   ##TABLE_START  /s/ Douglas R. Oberhelman   Douglas R. Oberhelman   Chairman of the Board   and Chief Executive Officer        /s/ Bradley M. Halverson   Bradley M. Halverson   Group President   and Chief Financial Officer         February 16, 2016  ##TABLE_ENDREPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of Caterpillar Inc.: In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated statement of financial position and the related consolidated statements of results of operations, comprehensive income, changes in stockholders equity, and of cash flow, including pages 69 through 148, present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Caterpillar Inc. and its subsidiaries  at  December 31, 2015 and 2014, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2015  in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2015, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013)  issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). The Company's management is responsible for these financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in Management's Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting appearing on page 67. Our responsibility is to express opinions on these financial statements and on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our integrated audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audits of the financial statements included examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions. A companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. /s/ PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP Peoria, Illinois February 16, 2016  ##TABLE_START STATEMENT 1 Caterpillar Inc.

Operations and summary of significant accounting policies ##TABLE_END  ##TABLE_START A. Nature of operations ##TABLE_END  Information in our financial statements and related commentary are presented in the following categories:  Machinery, Energy  Transportation  Represents the aggregate total of Construction Industries, Resource Industries, Energy  Transportation and All Other operating segments and related corporate items and eliminations.  Financial Products  Primarily includes the companys Financial Products Segment. This category includes Caterpillar Financial Services Corporation (Cat Financial), Caterpillar Financial Insurance Services (Insurance Services) and their respective subsidiaries.  Our products are sold primarily under the brands Caterpillar, CAT, design versions of CAT and Caterpillar, Electro-Motive, FG Wilson, MaK, MWM, Perkins, Progress Rail, SEM and Solar Turbines.  We conduct operations in our Machinery, Energy  Transportation lines of business under highly competitive conditions, including intense price competition. We place great emphasis on the high quality and performance of our products and our dealers service support. Although no one competitor is believed to produce all of the same types of equipment that we do, there are numerous companies, large and small, which compete with us in the sale of each of our products.  Our machines are distributed principally through a worldwide organization of dealers (dealer network), 48 located in the United States and 127 located outside the United States, serving 182 countries and operating 3,593 places of business, including 1,274 dealer rental outlets. Reciprocating engines are sold principally through the dealer network and to other manufacturers for use in products. Some of the reciprocating engines manufactured by our subsidiary Perkins Engines Company Limited, are also sold through its worldwide network of 97 distributors covering 180 countries. The FG Wilson branded electric power generation systems manufactured by our subsidiary Caterpillar Northern Ireland Limited are sold through its worldwide network of 290 distributors located in 145 countries. Some of the large, medium speed reciprocating engines are also sold under the MaK brand through a worldwide network of 19 distributors located in 130 countries. Our dealers do not deal exclusively with our products; however, in most cases sales and servicing of our products are the dealers principal business. Some products, primarily turbines and locomotives, are sold directly to end customers through sales forces employed by the company. At times, these employees are assisted by independent sales representatives.  The Financial Products line of business also conducts operations under highly competitive conditions. Financing for users of Caterpillar products is available through a variety of competitive sources, principally commercial banks and finance and leasing companies. We offer various financing plans designed to increase the opportunity for sales of our products and generate financing income for our company. A significant portion of Financial Products activity is conducted in North America, with additional offices in Latin America, Europe and Asia/Pacific. ##TABLE_START B. Basis of presentation ##TABLE_END  The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Caterpillar Inc. and its subsidiaries where we have a controlling financial interest. Investments in companies where our ownership exceeds 20 percent and we do not have a controlling interest or where the ownership is less than 20 percent and for which we have a significant influence are accounted for by the equity method. See Note 9 for further discussion. We consolidate all variable interest entities (VIEs) where Caterpillar Inc. is the primary beneficiary. For VIEs, we assess whether we are the primary beneficiary as prescribed by the accounting guidance on the consolidation of VIEs. The primary beneficiary of a VIE is the party that has both the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the entitys economic performance and the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits that could potentially be significant to the VIE. See Note 21 for further discussion on a consolidated VIE. We have affiliates, suppliers and dealers that are VIEs of which we are not the primary beneficiary. Although we have provided financial support, we do not have the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the economic performance of each entity. Our maximum exposure to loss from VIEs for which we are not the primary beneficiary was as follows: ##TABLE_START   December 31, (Millions of dollars)    Receivables - trade and other  $  $  Receivables - finance    Long-term receivables - finance    Investments in unconsolidated affiliated companies    Guarantees    Total  $  $        ##TABLE_ENDShipping and handling costs are included in Cost of goods sold in Statement 1. Other operating (income) expenses primarily include Cat Financials depreciation of equipment leased to others, Insurance Services underwriting expenses, gains (losses) on disposal of long-lived assets and business divestitures, long-lived asset impairment charges, legal settlements and accruals, employee separation charges and benefit plan curtailments and settlement gains (losses).  Prepaid expenses and other current assets in Statement 3 include prepaid rent, prepaid insurance, assets held for sale, core to be returned for remanufacturing, restricted cash and other short-term investments, and other prepaid items. Certain amounts for prior years have been reclassified to conform with the current-year financial statement presentation. ##TABLE_START C. Sales and revenue recognition ##TABLE_END  Sales of Machinery, Energy  Transportation are recognized and earned when all the following criteria are satisfied: (a) persuasive evidence of a sales arrangement exists; (b) price is fixed and determinable; (c) collectibility is reasonably assured; and (d) delivery has occurred. Persuasive evidence of an arrangement and a fixed or determinable price exist once we receive an order or contract from a customer or independently owned and operated dealer. We assess collectibility at the time of the sale and if collectibility is not reasonably assured, the sale is deferred and not recognized until collectibility is probable or payment is received. Typically, where product is produced and sold in the same country, title and risk of ownership transfer when the product is shipped. Products that are exported from a country for sale typically pass title and risk of ownership at the border of the destination country.  Sales of certain turbine machinery units, draglines and long wall roof supports are recognized under accounting for construction-type contracts, primarily using the percentage-of-completion method. Revenue is recognized based upon progress towards completion, which is estimated and continually updated over the course of construction. We provide for any loss that we expect to incur on these contracts when that loss is probable.  Our remanufacturing operations are primarily focused on the remanufacture of Cat engines and components and rail related products. In this business, used engines and related components (core) are inspected, cleaned and remanufactured. In connection with the sale of most of our remanufactured product, we collect a deposit from the dealer that is repaid if the dealer returns an acceptable core within a specified time period. Caterpillar owns and has title to the cores when they are returned from dealers. The rebuilt engine or component (the core plus any new content) is then sold as a remanufactured product to dealers and customers. Revenue is recognized pursuant to the same criteria as Machinery, Energy  Transportation sales noted above (title to the entire remanufactured product passes to the dealer upon sale). At the time of sale, the deposit is recognized in Other current liabilities in Statement 3. In addition, the core to be returned is recognized as an asset in Prepaid expenses and other current assets in Statement 3 at the estimated replacement cost (based on historical experience with useable cores). Upon receipt of an acceptable core, we repay the deposit and relieve the liability. The returned core is then included in inventory. In the event that the deposit is forfeited (i.e. upon failure by the dealer to return an acceptable core in the specified time period), we recognize the core deposit and the cost of the core in Sales and Cost of goods sold, respectively.  No right of return exists on sales of equipment. Replacement part returns are estimable and accrued at the time a sale is recognized.  We provide discounts to dealers through merchandising programs. We have numerous programs that are designed to promote the sale of our products. The most common dealer programs provide a discount when the dealer sells a product to a targeted end user. The cost of these discounts is estimated based on historical experience and known changes in merchandising programs and is reported as a reduction to sales when the product sale is recognized.  Our standard dealer invoice terms are established by marketing region. Our invoice terms for end-user customer sales are established by the responsible business unit. When a sale is made to a dealer, the dealer is responsible for payment even if the product is not sold to an end customer. Dealers and customers must make payment within the established invoice terms to avoid potential interest costs. Interest at or above prevailing market rates may be charged on any past due balance, and generally our practice is to not forgive this interest. In 2015 , 2014 and 2013 terms were extended to not more than one year for $635 million , $624 million and $706 million of receivables, respectively, which represent approximately 1 percent of consolidated sales. We establish a bad debt allowance for Machinery, Energy  Transportation receivables when it becomes probable that the receivable will not be collected. Our allowance for bad debts is not significant. Revenues of Financial Products are generated primarily from finance revenue on finance receivables and rental payments on operating leases. Finance revenue is recorded over the life of the related finance receivable using the interest method, including the accretion of certain direct origination costs that are deferred. Revenue from rental payments received on operating leases is recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease. Recognition of finance revenue and rental revenue is suspended and the account is placed on non-accrual status when management determines that collection of future income is not probable (generally after 120 days past due). Recognition is resumed, and previously suspended income is recognized, when the account becomes current and collection of remaining amounts is considered probable. See Note 6 for more information.  Sales and revenues are presented net of sales and other related taxes.  ##TABLE_START D. Inventories ##TABLE_END  Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market. Cost is principally determined using the last-in, first-out (LIFO) method. The value of inventories on the LIFO basis represented about 60 percent of total inventories at December 31, 2015 and 2014 .  If the FIFO (first-in, first-out) method had been in use, inventories would have been $2,498 million and $2,430 million higher than reported at December 31, 2015 and 2014 , respectively. ##TABLE_START E. Depreciation and amortization ##TABLE_END  Depreciation of plant and equipment is computed principally using accelerated methods. Depreciation on equipment leased to others, primarily for Financial Products, is computed using the straight-line method over the term of the lease. The depreciable basis is the original cost of the equipment less the estimated residual value of the equipment at the end of the lease term. In 2015 , 2014 and 2013 , Cat Financial depreciation on equipment leased to others was $836 million , $872 million and $768 million , respectively, and was included in Other operating (income) expenses in Statement 1. In 2015 , 2014 and 2013 , consolidated depreciation expense was $2,705 million , $2,795 million and $2,710 million , respectively. Amortization of purchased finite-lived intangibles is computed principally using the straight-line method, generally not to exceed a period of 20 years .  ##TABLE_START F. Foreign currency translation ##TABLE_END  The functional currency for most of our Machinery, Energy  Transportation consolidated companies is the U.S. dollar. The functional currency for most of our Financial Products and affiliates accounted for under the equity method is the respective local currency. Gains and losses resulting from the remeasurement of foreign currency amounts to the functional currency are included in Other income (expense) in Statement 1. Gains and losses resulting from translating assets and liabilities from the functional currency to U.S. dollars are included in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in Statement 3.  ##TABLE_START G. Derivative financial instruments ##TABLE_END  Our earnings and cash flow are subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates and commodity prices. Our Risk Management Policy (policy) allows for the use of derivative financial instruments to prudently manage foreign currency exchange rate, interest rate and commodity price exposures. Our policy specifies that derivatives are not to be used for speculative purposes. Derivatives that we use are primarily foreign currency forward, option, and cross currency contracts, interest rate swaps, and commodity forward and option contracts. All derivatives are recorded at fair value. See Note 3 for more information. ##TABLE_START H. Income taxes ##TABLE_END  The provision for income taxes is determined using the asset and liability approach taking into account guidance related to uncertain tax positions. Tax laws require items to be included in tax filings at different times than the items are reflected in the financial statements. A current liability is recognized for the estimated taxes payable for the current year. Deferred taxes represent the future tax consequences expected to occur when the reported amounts of assets and liabilities are recovered or paid. Deferred taxes are adjusted for enacted changes in tax rates and tax laws. Valuation allowances are recorded to reduce deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will not be realized. ##TABLE_START I. Goodwill ##TABLE_END  For acquisitions accounted for as a business combination, goodwill represents the excess of the cost over the fair value of the net assets acquired. We are required to test goodwill for impairment, at the reporting unit level, annually and when events or circumstances indicate the fair value of a reporting unit may be below its carrying value. A reporting unit is an operating segment or one level below an operating segment (referred to as a component) to which goodwill is assigned when initially recorded. We assign goodwill to reporting units based on our integration plans and the expected synergies resulting from the acquisition. Because Caterpillar is a highly integrated company, the businesses we acquire are sometimes combined with or integrated into existing reporting units. When changes occur in the composition of our operating segments or reporting units, goodwill is reassigned to the affected reporting units based on their relative fair values.  We test goodwill for impairment annually and whenever events or circumstances make it more likely than not that an impairment may have occurred. We perform our annual goodwill impairment test as of October 1 and monitor for interim triggering events on an ongoing basis. Goodwill is reviewed for impairment utilizing either a qualitative assessment or a two-step process. We have an option to make a qualitative assessment of a reporting units goodwill for impairment. If we choose to perform a qualitative assessment and determine the fair value more likely than not exceeds the carrying value, no further evaluation is necessary. For reporting units where we perform the two-step process, the first step requires us to compare the fair value of each reporting unit, which we primarily determine using an income approach based on the present value of discounted cash flows, to the respective carrying value, which includes goodwill. If the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying value, the goodwill is not considered impaired. If the carrying value is higher than the fair value, there is an indication that an impairment may exist and the second step is required. In step two, the implied fair value of goodwill is calculated as the excess of the fair value of a reporting unit over the fair values assigned to its assets and liabilities. If the implied fair value of goodwill is less than the carrying value of the reporting units goodwill, the difference is recognized as an impairment loss. See Note 10 for further details. ##TABLE_START J. Estimates in financial statements ##TABLE_END  The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts. The more significant estimates include: residual values for leased assets, fair values for goodwill impairment tests, impairment of available-for-sale securities, warranty liability, stock-based compensation and reserves for product liability and insurance losses, postretirement benefits, post-sale discounts, credit losses and income taxes. ##TABLE_START K. New accounting guidance ##TABLE_END  Reporting discontinued operations and disclosures of disposals of components of an entity  In April 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued accounting guidance for determining which disposals can be presented as discontinued operations and modifies related disclosure requirements. The guidance defines a discontinued operation as a disposal of a component or group of components that is disposed of or is classified as held for sale and represents a strategic shift that has (or will have) a major effect on an entity's operations and financial results. This guidance was effective January 1, 2015 and did not have a material impact on our financial statements. Revenue recognition  In May 2014, the FASB issued new revenue recognition guidance to provide a single, comprehensive revenue recognition model for all contracts with customers. Under the new guidance, an entity will recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers at an amount that the entity expects to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services. A five step model has been introduced for an entity to apply when recognizing revenue. The new guidance also includes enhanced disclosure requirements, and is effective January 1, 2018, with early adoption permitted for January 1, 2017. Entities have the option to apply the new guidance under a retrospective approach to each prior reporting period presented, or a modified retrospective approach with the cumulative effect of initially applying the new guidance recognized at the date of initial application within the Consolidated Statement of Changes in Stockholders' Equity. We are in the process of evaluating the application and implementation of the new guidance. Variable interest entities (VIE)  In February 2015, the FASB issued accounting guidance on the consolidation of VIEs. The new guidance revises previous guidance by establishing an analysis for determining whether a limited partnership or similar entity is a VIE and whether outsourced decision-maker fees are considered variable interests. In addition, the new guidance revises how a reporting entity evaluates economics and related parties when assessing who should consolidate a VIE. This guidance was effective January 1, 2016 and did not have a material impact on our financial statements. Presentation of debt issuance costs  In April 2015, the FASB issued accounting guidance which requires debt issuance costs to be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying value of the associated debt liability. Prior to the issuance of the new guidance, debt issuance costs were required to be presented in the balance sheet as an asset. This guidance was effective January 1, 2016 and did not have a material impact on our financial statements. Fair value disclosures for investments in certain entities that calculate net asset value per share  In May 2015, the FASB issued accounting guidance which removes the requirement to categorize within the fair value hierarchy investments measured at net asset value (or its equivalent) as a practical expedient for fair value. The new guidance requires that the amount of these investments continue to be disclosed to reconcile the fair value hierarchy disclosure to the balance sheet. The guidance was effective January 1, 2016 and will be applied retrospectively. The adoption did not have a material impact on our financial statements. Simplifying the measurement of inventory  In July 2015, the FASB issued accounting guidance which requires that inventory be measured at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Prior to the issuance of the new guidance, inventory was measured at the lower of cost or market. Replacing the concept of market with the single measurement of net realizable value is intended to create efficiencies for preparers. Inventory measured using the last-in, first-out (LIFO) method and the retail inventory method are not impacted by the new guidance. The guidance is effective January 1, 2017. We do not expect the adoption to have a material impact on our financial statements. Simplifying the accounting for measurement-period adjustments  In September 2015, the FASB issued accounting guidance which eliminates the requirement for an acquirer in a business combination to restate prior period financial statements for measurement period adjustments. An acquirer in a business combination is required to report provisional amounts when measurements are incomplete at the end of the reporting period covering the business combination. Prior to the issuance of the new guidance, an acquirer was required to adjust such provisional amounts by restating prior period financial statements. Under the new guidance, the acquirer will recognize the measurement-period adjustment in the period the adjustment is determined. The guidance was effective January 1, 2016 and will be applied prospectively. The adoption did not have a material impact on our financial statements. Balance sheet classification of deferred taxes - In November 2015, the FASB issued accounting guidance that requires all deferred tax assets and liabilities, along with any related valuation allowance, to be classified as noncurrent on the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position. Current guidance requires the deferred taxes for each jurisdiction to be presented as a net current asset or liability and net noncurrent asset or liability. As a result of the new guidance, each jurisdiction will now only have one net noncurrent deferred tax asset or liability. The new guidance does not change the existing requirement that only permits offsetting deferred tax assets and liabilities within a single jurisdiction. Entities have the option to apply the new guidance prospectively or retrospectively. The new guidance is effective January 1, 2017, with early adoption permitted. We adopted the new guidance effective January 1, 2016 and will apply it retrospectively. The adoption results in the reclassification of current deferred tax assets and liabilities to noncurrent assets and liabilities. See Note 5 on page 93 for the deferred taxes included in Statement 3. Recognition and measurement of financial assets and financial liabilities - In January 2016, the FASB issued accounting guidance that affects the accounting for equity investments, financial liabilities accounted for under the fair value option and the presentation and disclosure requirements for financial instruments. Under the new guidance, all equity investments in unconsolidated entities (other than those accounted for using the equity method of accounting) will generally be measured at fair value through earnings. There will no longer be an available-for-sale classification for equity securities with readily determinable fair values. For financial liabilities when the fair value option has been elected, changes in fair value due to instrument-specific credit risk will be recognized separately in other comprehensive income. In addition, the FASB clarified guidance related to the valuation allowance assessment when recognizing deferred tax assets resulting from unrealized losses on available-for-sale debt securities. The new guidance is effective January 1, 2018, with the cumulative effect adjustment from initially applying the new guidance recognized in the Statement of Financial Position as of the beginning of the year of adoption. The impact from adoption on our financial statements will be based on changes in the fair value of our available-for-sale equity securities subsequent to January 1, 2018, which will be recorded through earnings. ##TABLE_START 2. Stock-based compensation ##TABLE_END  Our stock-based compensation plans primarily provide for the granting of stock options, stock-settled stock appreciation rights (SARs), restricted stock units (RSUs) and performance-based restricted stock units (PRSUs) to Officers and other key employees, as well as non-employee Directors. Stock options permit a holder to buy Caterpillar stock at the stocks price when the option was granted. SARs permit a holder the right to receive the value in shares of the appreciation in Caterpillar stock that occurred from the date the right was granted up to the date of exercise. RSUs are agreements to issue shares of Caterpillar stock at the time of vesting. PRSUs are similar to RSUs and include performance conditions in the vesting terms of the award.  Our long-standing practices and policies specify all stock-based compensation awards are approved by the Compensation Committee (the Committee) of the Board of Directors on the date of grant. The stock-based award approval process specifies the number of awards granted, the terms of the award and the grant date. The same terms and conditions are consistently applied to all employee grants, including Officers. The Committee approves all individual Officer grants. The number of stock-based compensation awards included in an individuals award is determined based on the methodology approved by the Committee. The exercise price methodology approved by the Committee is the closing price of the Company stock on the date of the grant. The 2013 and 2014 grants were issued under the Caterpillar Inc. 2006 Long-Term Incentive Plan (approved by stockholders in June of 2006). In June of 2014, stockholders approved the Caterpillar Inc. 2014 Long-Term Incentive Plan under which all new stock-based compensation awards are granted.  Common stock issued from Treasury stock under the plans totaled 2,931,595 for 2015 , 10,106,542 for 2014 and 6,258,692 for 2013 . The total number of shares authorized for equity awards under the Caterpillar Inc. 2014 Long-Term Incentive Plan is 38,800,000 , of which 25,503,631 shares remained available for issuance as of December 31, 2015.  Awards granted prior to 2015 generally vest three years after the date of grant (cliff vesting). The awards granted in 2015 generally vest according to a three -year graded vesting schedule. One-third of the award will become vested on the first anniversary of the grant date, one-third of the award will become vested on the second anniversary of the grant date and one-third of the award will become vested on the third anniversary of the grant date. Beginning in 2015, PRSUs were granted. PRSUs generally have a three -year performance period and vest upon achievement of performance targets established at the time of grant. At grant, SARs and option awards have a term life of ten years . Upon separation from service, if the participant is 55 years of age or older with more than five years of service, the participant meets the criteria for a Long Service Separation. If the Long Service Separation criteria are met, the vested options/SARs will have a life that is the lesser of ten years from the original grant date or five years from the separation date.  Prior to 2015, our stock-based compensation award terms allowed for the immediate vesting upon separation for employees who met the criteria for a \"Long Service Separation\" and fulfilled a requisite service period of six months . For these employees, compensation expense was recognized over the period from the grant date to the end date of the six-month requisite service period. Award terms for the 2015 grant allowed for the immediate vesting upon separation for employees who met the criteria for a \"Long Service Separation\" with no requisite service period. For these employees, compensation expense for the 2015 grant was recognized immediately on the grant date. For employees who become eligible for immediate vesting under a \"Long Service Separation\" subsequent to the grant date and prior to the completion of the vesting period, compensation expense is recognized over the period from grant date to the date eligibility is achieved.  Accounting guidance on share-based payments requires companies to estimate the fair value of options/SARs on the date of grant using an option-pricing model. The fair value of our option/SAR grants was estimated using a lattice-based option-pricing model. The lattice-based option-pricing model considers a range of assumptions related to volatility, risk-free interest rate and historical employee behavior. Expected volatility was based on historical Caterpillar stock price movement and current implied volatilities from traded options on Caterpillar stock. The risk-free rate was based on U.S. Treasury security yields at the time of grant. The weighted-average dividend yield was based on historical information. The expected life was determined from the lattice-based model. The lattice-based model incorporated exercise and post vesting forfeiture assumptions based on analysis of historical data. The following table provides the assumptions used in determining the fair value of the stock-based awards for the years ended December 31, 2015 , 2014 and 2013 , respectively. ##TABLE_START  Grant Year    Weighted-average dividend yield 2.3 %  2.2 %  2.1 % Weighted-average volatility 28.4 %  28.2 %  30.6 % Range of volatilities 19.9-35.9%  18.4-36.2%  23.4-40.6% Range of risk-free interest rates 0.22-2.08%  0.12-2.60%  0.16-1.88% Weighted-average expected lives 8 years  8 years  8 years       ##TABLE_END The fair value of RSU and PRSU grants was estimated by reducing the stock price on the date of grant by the present value of the estimated dividends to be paid during the vesting period. The estimated dividends are based on Caterpillars quarterly dividend per share at the time of the grant.  Please refer to Tables I and II below for additional information on our stock-based awards.  ##TABLE_START TABLE I  Financial Information Related to Stock-based Compensation        Stock options / SARs  RSUs  PRSUs  Shares  Weighted- Average Exercise Price  Shares  Weighted- Average Grant Date Fair Value  Shares  Weighted- Average Grant Date Fair Value             Outstanding at January 1, 2015 34,581,083  $ 74.48  4,084,136  $ 91.92    $  Granted to officers and key employees 1 7,939,497  $ 83.34  1,690,661  $ 77.55  132,068  $ 77.47 Exercised (3,513,271 )  $ 57.37    $     $  Vested   $   (1,350,457 )  $ 102.63    $  Forfeited / expired (668,784 )  $ 76.78  (93,827 )  $ 84.28    $  Outstanding at December 31, 2015 38,338,525  $ 77.84  4,330,513  $ 83.14  132,068  $ 77.47 Exercisable at December 31, 2015 24,807,381  $ 72.26         ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START Stock options/SARs outstanding and exercisable as of December 31, 2015:        Outstanding  Exercisable Exercise Prices  Shares Outstanding at 12/31/15  Weighted- Average Remaining Contractual Life (Years)  Weighted- Average Exercise Price  Aggregate Intrinsic Value 2  Shares Outstanding at 12/31/15  Weighted- Average Remaining Contractual Life (Years)  Weighted- Average Exercise Price  Aggregate Intrinsic Value 2 $22.17 - 57.85  8,293,122  3.79  $ 44.29  $  8,293,122  3.79  $ 44.29  $ $63.04 - 73.20  7,876,270  1.15  $ 70.12   7,876,270  1.15  $ 70.12  $83.00 - 86.77  7,433,988  9.08  $ 83.05    520,547  9.18  $ 83.00   $88.51 - 96.31  8,872,548  7.49  $ 92.88    2,254,845  6.78  $ 91.53   $102.13 - 110.09  5,862,597  5.71  $ 106.31    5,862,597  5.71  $ 106.31     38,338,525    $ 77.84  $  24,807,381    $ 72.26  $ ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START 1  No SARs were granted during the year ended December 31, 2015 . ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START 2  The difference between a stock awards exercise price and the underlying stocks closing market price at December 31, 2015 , for awards with market price greater than the exercise price.

Stock-based compensation expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period for awards with terms that specify cliff or graded vesting and contain only service conditions. Stock-based compensation expense for PRSUs is based on the probable number of shares expected to vest and is recognized using the graded vesting method when the award terms specify a graded vesting schedule. Before tax, stock-based compensation expense for 2015 , 2014 and 2013 was $283 million , $254 million and $231 million , respectively, with a corresponding income tax benefit of $87 million , $79 million and $73 million , respectively. The amount of stock-based compensation expense capitalized for the years ended December 31, 2015 , 2014 and 2013 did not have a significant impact on our financial statements.  At December 31, 2015 , there was $215 million of total unrecognized compensation cost from stock-based compensation arrangements granted under the plans, which is related to non-vested stock-based awards. The compensation expense is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of approximately 1.8 years. We currently use shares in treasury stock to satisfy share award exercises.  The cash tax benefits realized from stock awards exercised for 2015 , 2014 and 2013 were $68 million , $253 million and $127 million , respectively. We use the direct only method and tax law ordering approach to calculate the tax effects of stock-based compensation. In certain jurisdictions, tax deductions for exercises of stock-based awards did not generate a cash benefit. A tax benefit of approximately $21 million will be recorded in additional paid-in capital when these deductions reduce our future income taxes payable.  ##TABLE_START 3. Derivative financial instruments and risk management ##TABLE_END  Our earnings and cash flow are subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates and commodity prices. Our Risk Management Policy (policy) allows for the use of derivative financial instruments to prudently manage foreign currency exchange rate, interest rate and commodity price exposures. Our policy specifies that derivatives are not to be used for speculative purposes. Derivatives that we use are primarily foreign currency forward, option and cross currency contracts, interest rate swaps and commodity forward and option contracts. Our derivative activities are subject to the management, direction and control of our senior financial officers. Risk management practices, including the use of financial derivative instruments, are presented to the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors at least annually.  All derivatives are recognized in Statement 3 at their fair value. On the date the derivative contract is entered into, we designate the derivative as (1) a hedge of the fair value of a recognized asset or liability (fair value hedge), (2) a hedge of a forecasted transaction or the variability of cash flow to be paid (cash flow hedge) or (3) an undesignated instrument. Changes in the fair value of a derivative that is qualified, designated and highly effective as a fair value hedge, along with the gain or loss on the hedged recognized asset or liability that is attributable to the hedged risk, are recorded in current earnings. Changes in the fair value of a derivative that is qualified, designated and highly effective as a cash flow hedge are recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) (AOCI), to the extent effective, in Statement 3 until they are reclassified to earnings in the same period or periods during which the hedged transaction affects earnings. Changes in the fair value of undesignated derivative instruments and the ineffective portion of designated derivative instruments are reported in current earnings. Cash flow from designated derivative financial instruments are classified within the same category as the item being hedged on Statement 5. Cash flow from undesignated derivative financial instruments are included in the investing category on Statement 5.  We formally document all relationships between hedging instruments and hedged items, as well as the risk-management objective and strategy for undertaking various hedge transactions. This process includes linking all derivatives that are designated as fair value hedges to specific assets and liabilities in Statement 3 and linking cash flow hedges to specific forecasted transactions or variability of cash flow.  We also formally assess, both at the hedges inception and on an ongoing basis, whether the designated derivatives that are used in hedging transactions are highly effective in offsetting changes in fair values or cash flow of hedged items. When a derivative is determined not to be highly effective as a hedge or the underlying hedged transaction is no longer probable, we discontinue hedge accounting prospectively, in accordance with the derecognition criteria for hedge accounting.  ##TABLE_START A. Foreign currency exchange rate risk ##TABLE_END  Foreign currency exchange rate movements create a degree of risk by affecting the U.S. dollar value of sales made and costs incurred in foreign currencies. Movements in foreign currency rates also affect our competitive position as these changes may affect business practices and/or pricing strategies of non-U.S.-based competitors. Additionally, we have balance sheet positions denominated in foreign currencies, thereby creating exposure to movements in exchange rates.  Our Machinery, Energy  Transportation operations purchase, manufacture and sell products in many locations around the world. As we have a diversified revenue and cost base, we manage our future foreign currency cash flow exposure on a net basis. We use foreign currency forward and option contracts to manage unmatched foreign currency cash inflow and outflow. Our objective is to minimize the risk of exchange rate movements that would reduce the U.S. dollar value of our foreign currency cash flow. Our policy allows for managing anticipated foreign currency cash flow for up to five years . As of December 31, 2015, the maximum term of these outstanding contracts was approximately 15 months .  We generally designate as cash flow hedges at inception of the contract any Australian dollar, Brazilian real, British pound, Canadian dollar, Chinese yuan, Indian rupee, Japanese yen, Mexican peso, Norwegian krona, Singapore dollar, Swiss franc, or Thailand baht forward or option contracts that meet the requirements for hedge accounting and the maturity extends beyond the current quarter-end. Designation is performed on a specific exposure basis to support hedge accounting. The remainder of Machinery, Energy  Transportation foreign currency contracts are undesignated.  As of December 31, 2015 , $8 million of deferred net losses, net of tax, included in equity (AOCI in Statement 3), are expected to be reclassified to current earnings (Other income (expense) in Statement 1) over the next twelve months when earnings are affected by the hedged transactions. The actual amount recorded in Other income (expense) will vary based on exchange rates at the time the hedged transactions impact earnings.  In managing foreign currency risk for our Financial Products operations, our objective is to minimize earnings volatility resulting from conversion and the remeasurement of net foreign currency balance sheet positions, and future transactions denominated in foreign currencies. Our policy allows the use of foreign currency forward, option and cross currency contracts to offset the risk of currency mismatch between our receivables and debt, and exchange rate risk associated with future transactions denominated in foreign currencies. Substantially all such foreign currency forward, option and cross currency contracts are undesignated.  ##TABLE_START B. Interest rate risk ##TABLE_END  Interest rate movements create a degree of risk by affecting the amount of our interest payments and the value of our fixed-rate debt. Our practice is to use interest rate derivatives to manage our exposure to interest rate changes.  Our Machinery, Energy  Transportation operations generally use fixed rate debt as a source of funding. Our objective is to minimize the cost of borrowed funds. Our policy allows us to enter into fixed-to-floating interest rate swaps and forward rate agreements to meet that objective. We designate fixed-to-floating interest rate swaps as fair value hedges at inception of the contract, and we designate certain forward rate agreements as cash flow hedges at inception of the contract. As of December 31, 2015 , $4 million of deferred net losses, net of tax, included in equity (AOCI in Statement 3), related to Machinery, Energy  Transportation forward rate agreements, are expected to be reclassified to current earnings (Interest expense excluding Financial Products in Statement 1) over the next twelve months.  Financial Products operations has a match-funding policy that addresses interest rate risk by aligning the interest rate profile (fixed or floating rate) of Cat Financials debt portfolio with the interest rate profile of their receivables portfolio within predetermined ranges on an ongoing basis. In connection with that policy, we use interest rate derivative instruments to modify the debt structure to match assets within the receivables portfolio. This matched funding reduces the volatility of margins between interest-bearing assets and interest-bearing liabilities, regardless of which direction interest rates move.  Our policy allows us to use fixed-to-floating, floating-to-fixed and floating-to-floating interest rate swaps to meet the match-funding objective. We designate fixed-to-floating interest rate swaps as fair value hedges to protect debt against changes in fair value due to changes in the benchmark interest rate. We designate most floating-to-fixed interest rate swaps as cash flow hedges to protect against the variability of cash flows due to changes in the benchmark interest rate. As of December 31, 2015 , less than $1 million of deferred net losses, net of tax, included in equity (AOCI in Statement 3), related to Financial Products floating-to-fixed interest rate swaps, are expected to be reclassified to current earnings (Interest expense of Financial Products in Statement 1) over the next twelve months. The actual amount recorded in Interest expense of Financial Products will vary based on interest rates at the time the hedged transactions impact earnings.  We have, at certain times, liquidated fixed-to-floating and floating-to-fixed interest rate swaps at both Machinery, Energy  Transportation and Financial Products. The gains or losses associated with these swaps at the time of liquidation are amortized into earnings over the original term of the previously designated hedged item.  ##TABLE_START C. Commodity price risk ##TABLE_END  Commodity price movements create a degree of risk by affecting the price we must pay for certain raw material. Our policy is to use commodity forward and option contracts to manage the commodity risk and reduce the cost of purchased materials.  Our Machinery, Energy  Transportation operations purchase base and precious metals embedded in the components we purchase from suppliers. Our suppliers pass on to us price changes in the commodity portion of the component cost. In addition, we are subject to price changes on energy products such as natural gas and diesel fuel purchased for operational use.  Our objective is to minimize volatility in the price of these commodities. Our policy allows us to enter into commodity forward and option contracts to lock in the purchase price of a portion of these commodities within a five -year horizon. All such commodity forward and option contracts are undesignated.

The indefinitely reinvested profits of Caterpillar SARL, primarily taxable in Switzerland, contribute the most significant amount of this line item. Although not individually significant by jurisdiction, pre-tax permanent differences due to nondeductible net foreign exchange losses of non-U.S. subsidiaries were approximately $180 million , $90 million and $10 million in 2015 , 2014 and 2013 , respectively. The provision for income taxes for 2015 included a $42 million net charge to increase unrecognized tax benefits by $68 million as discussed on page 95 offset by a benefit of $26 million to record U.S. refund claims related to prior tax years currently under examination. The provision for income taxes for 2014 included a benefit of $23 million for the release of a valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets of a non-U.S. subsidiary and a net benefit of $21 million to adjust prior years' U.S. taxes and interest. The net benefit for prior years' U.S. taxes and interest included a $33 million benefit to reflect a settlement with the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (IRS) related to 1992 through 1994 which resulted in a $16 million benefit to remeasure previously unrecognized tax benefits and a $17 million benefit to adjust related interest, net of tax. This benefit of $33 million was offset by a net charge of $12 million to adjust prior years' U.S. taxes that included a charge of $55 million to correct for an error which resulted in an understatement of tax liabilities for prior years. Management has concluded that the error was not material to any period presented. The provision for income taxes for 2013 included a $87 million benefit primarily related to the research and development tax credit that was retroactively extended in 2013 for 2012 and a benefit of $55 million resulting from true-up of estimated amounts used in the tax provision to the 2012 U.S. income tax return as filed in September 2013. We have recorded income tax expense at U.S. tax rates on all profits, except for undistributed profits of non-U.S. subsidiaries of approximately $17 billion which are considered indefinitely reinvested. Upon distribution of these profits in the form of dividends or otherwise, we would be subject to both U.S. income taxes (subject to an adjustment for foreign tax credits) and in some instances withholding taxes payable to the various non-U.S. jurisdictions. Determination of the amount of unrecognized deferred tax liability related to indefinitely reinvested profits is not feasible primarily due to our legal entity structure and the complexity of U.S. and local tax laws. If management intentions or U.S. tax law changes in the future, there may be a significant negative impact on the provision for income taxes to record an incremental tax liability in the period the change occurs. At December 31, 2015, cash and short-term investments held by non-U.S. subsidiaries was approximately $5 billion .  Accounting for income taxes under U.S. GAAP requires that individual tax-paying entities of the company offset all current deferred tax liabilities and assets within each particular tax jurisdiction and present them as a single amount in the Consolidated Financial Position. A similar procedure is followed for all noncurrent deferred tax liabilities and assets. Amounts in different tax jurisdictions cannot be offset against each other. The amount of deferred income taxes at December 31, included on the following lines in Statement 3, are as follows:  ##TABLE_START   December 31, (Millions of dollars)   Assets:     Deferred and refundable income taxes  $  $ Noncurrent deferred and refundable income taxes  1,532  1,267   2,442  2,259 Liabilities:     Other current liabilities   Other liabilities   Deferred income taxesnet  $ 2,032  $ 1,783      ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START Deferred income tax assets and liabilities:       December 31, (Millions of dollars)   Deferred income tax assets:     Pension  $ 1,694  $ 1,513 Postemployment benefits other than pensions  1,339  1,514 Tax carryforwards  1,098  Warranty reserves   Stock-based compensation   Inventory   Allowance for credit losses   Post sale discounts   Deferred compensation   Othernet     6,059  5,703      Deferred income tax liabilities:     Capital and intangible assets  (2,561 )  (2,625 ) Bond discount  (225 )  (233 ) Translation  (343 )  (252 ) Undistributed profits of non-U.S. subsidiaries  (82 )  (69 )   (3,211 )  (3,179 ) Valuation allowance for deferred tax assets  (816 )  (741 ) Deferred income taxesnet  $ 2,032  $ 1,783      ##TABLE_END At December 31, 2015 , approximately $557 million of U.S. state tax net operating losses (NOLs) and $145 million of U.S. state tax credit carryforwards were available. The state NOLs primarily expire between 2016 and 2035. The state tax credit carryforwards primarily expire over the next five years with certain carryforwards set to expire over the next fifteen years. Of the total $189 million of deferred tax assets related to state NOLs and credit carryforwards, we established a valuation allowance of $164 million for those that are more likely than not to expire prior to utilization.  At December 31, 2015 , approximately $307 million of U.S. foreign tax credits were available for carryforward. These credits expire in 2025 and 2026. At December 31, 2015 , amounts and expiration dates of net operating loss carryforwards in various non-U.S. taxing jurisdictions were:  ##TABLE_START (Millions of dollars)    2019-2021  2022-2036  Unlimited  Total $  $  $  $  $  $ 1,780  $ 2,637 ##TABLE_END At December 31, 2015 , non-U.S. entities that have not yet demonstrated consistent and/or sustainable profitability to support the realization of net deferred tax assets have recorded valuation allowances of $652 million , including certain entities in Luxembourg.

We recognized a net provision for interest and penalties of $20 million , $3 million and $7 million during the years ended December 31, 2015 , 2014 and 2013 , respectively. The total amount of interest and penalties accrued was $79 million and $61 million as of December 31, 2015 and 2014 , respectively.  On January 30, 2015, we received a Revenue Agent's Report (RAR) from the IRS indicating the end of the field examination of our U.S. income tax returns for 2007 to 2009 including the impact of a loss carryback to 2005. The RAR proposed tax increases and penalties for these years of approximately $1 billion primarily related to two significant areas that we are vigorously contesting through the IRS Appeals process. In the first area, the IRS has proposed to tax in the United States profits earned from certain parts transactions by one of our non-U.S. subsidiaries, Caterpillar SARL (CSARL), based on the IRS examination teams application of the substance-over-form or assignment-of-income judicial doctrines. We believe that the relevant transactions complied with applicable tax laws and did not violate judicial doctrines. We have filed U.S. income tax returns on this same basis for years after 2009. Based on the information currently available, we do not anticipate a significant increase or decrease to our unrecognized tax benefits for this matter within the next 12 months. We currently believe the ultimate disposition of this matter will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position, liquidity or results of operations. In the second area, the IRS disallowed approximately $125 million of foreign tax credits that arose as a result of certain financings unrelated to CSARL. Decisions of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit involving other taxpayers in 2015 caused us to conclude the benefits of this uncertain tax position are no longer more likely than not to be sustained based on technical merits. As tax benefits related to this tax position can no longer be recognized in the financial statements, we increased unrecognized tax benefits by $68 million . We will continue to monitor ongoing court cases involving other taxpayers for information that may impact our analysis of this tax position. The IRS field examination of our U.S. income tax returns for 2010 to 2012 began in 2015. With the exception of a loss carryback to 2005, tax years prior to 2007 are generally no longer subject to U.S. tax assessment. In our major non-U.S. jurisdictions including Australia, Brazil, China, Germany, Japan, Switzerland, Singapore and the U.K., tax years are typically subject to examination for three to eight years. Due to the uncertainty related to the timing and potential outcome of audits, we cannot estimate the range of reasonably possible change in unrecognized tax benefits in the next 12 months. ##TABLE_START 6.

Accordingly, this presentation should not be regarded as a forecast of future cash collections. Please refer to Note 18 and Table III for fair value information.  ##TABLE_START C. Allowance for credit losses ##TABLE_END  The allowance for credit losses is an estimate of the losses inherent in Cat Financials finance receivable portfolio and includes consideration of accounts that have been individually identified as impaired, as well as pools of finance receivables where it is probable that certain receivables in the pool are impaired but the individual accounts cannot yet be identified. In identifying and measuring impairment, management takes into consideration past loss experience, known and inherent risks in the portfolio, adverse situations that may affect the borrowers ability to repay, estimated value of underlying collateral and current economic conditions. Accounts are identified for individual review based on past-due status and using information available about the customer, such as financial statements, news reports and published credit ratings, as well as general information regarding industry trends and the economic environment in which Cat Financials customers operate. The allowance for credit losses attributable to finance receivables that are individually evaluated and determined to be impaired is based either on the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the receivables' effective interest rate or the fair value of the collateral for collateral-dependent receivables. In determining collateral value, Cat Financial estimates the current fair market value of the collateral less selling costs. Cat Financial also considers credit enhancements such as additional collateral and contractual third-party guarantees. The allowance for credit losses attributable to the remaining accounts not yet individually identified as impaired is estimated based on loss forecast models utilizing probabilities of default, our estimate of the loss emergence period and the estimated loss given default. In addition, qualitative factors not able to be fully captured in the loss forecast models including industry trends, macroeconomic factors and model imprecision are considered in the evaluation of the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses. These qualitative factors are subjective and require a degree of management judgment. Cat Financials allowance for credit losses is segregated into two portfolio segments:  ##TABLE_START  Customer - Finance receivables with retail customers. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  Dealer - Finance receivables with Caterpillar dealers. ##TABLE_END A portfolio segment is the level at which the Company develops a systematic methodology for determining its allowance for credit losses.  Cat Financial further evaluates portfolio segments by the class of finance receivables, which is defined as a level of information (below a portfolio segment) in which the finance receivables have the same initial measurement attribute and a similar method for assessing and monitoring credit risk. Typically, Cat Financials finance receivables within a geographic area have similar credit risk profiles and methods for assessing and monitoring credit risk. Cat Financials classes, which align with management reporting for credit losses, are as follows:  ##TABLE_START  North America - Finance receivables originated in the United States or Canada. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  Europe - Finance receivables originated in Europe, Africa, Middle East and the Commonwealth of Independent States. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  Asia Pacific - Finance receivables originated in Australia, New Zealand, China, Japan, South Korea and Southeast Asia. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  Mining - Finance receivables related to large mining customers worldwide. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  Latin America - Finance receivables originated in Central and South American countries and Mexico. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  Caterpillar Power Finance - Finance receivables related to marine vessels with Caterpillar engines worldwide and Caterpillar electrical power generation, gas compression and co-generation systems and non-Caterpillar equipment that is powered by these systems worldwide. ##TABLE_END An analysis of the allowance for credit losses was as follows: ##TABLE_START (Millions of dollars)  December 31, 2015   Customer  Dealer  Total Allowance for Credit Losses:       Balance at beginning of year  $  $  $ Receivables written off  (196 )    (196 ) Recoveries on receivables previously written off     Provision for credit losses   (1 )  Other  (25 )    (25 ) Balance at end of year  $  $  $        Individually evaluated for impairment  $  $   $ Collectively evaluated for impairment    Ending Balance  $  $  $        Recorded Investment in Finance Receivables:       Individually evaluated for impairment  $  $   $ Collectively evaluated for impairment  18,788  3,570  22,358 Ending Balance  $ 19,389  $ 3,570  $ 22,959        ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START (Millions of dollars)  December 31, 2014   Customer  Dealer  Total Allowance for Credit Losses:       Balance at beginning of year  $  $  $ Receivables written off  (151 )    (151 ) Recoveries on receivables previously written off     Provision for credit losses     Other  (23 )    (23 ) Balance at end of year  $  $  $        Individually evaluated for impairment  $  $   $ Collectively evaluated for impairment    Ending Balance  $  $  $        Recorded Investment in Finance Receivables:       Individually evaluated for impairment  $  $   $ Collectively evaluated for impairment  19,899  3,554  23,453 Ending Balance  $ 20,512  $ 3,554  $ 24,066        ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START        ##TABLE_ENDCredit quality of finance receivables  At origination, Cat Financial evaluates credit risk based on a variety of credit quality factors including prior payment experience, customer financial information, credit-rating agency ratings, loan-to-value ratios and other internal metrics. On an ongoing basis, Cat Financial monitors credit quality based on past-due status and collection experience as there is a meaningful correlation between the past-due status of customers and the risk of loss. In determining past-due status, Cat Financial considers the entire finance receivable balance past due when any installment is over 30 days past due. The tables below summarize the recorded investment of finance receivables by aging category. ##TABLE_START (Millions of dollars)  December 31, 2015   31-60 Days Past Due  61-90 Days Past Due  91+ Days Past Due  Total Past Due  Current  Total Finance Receivables  91+ Still Accruing Customer               North America  $  $  $  $  $ 7,850  $ 7,937  $ Europe      2,358  2,427  Asia Pacific      1,647  1,701  Mining      1,793  1,868  Latin America      1,998  2,273   Caterpillar Power Finance       3,147  3,183  Dealer               North America          2,209  2,209   Europe             Asia Pacific             Mining             Latin America             Caterpillar Power Finance             Total  $  $  $  $  $ 22,363  $ 22,959  $                ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (Millions of dollars)  December 31, 2014   31-60 Days Past Due  61-90 Days Past Due  91+ Days Past Due  Total Past Due  Current  Total Finance Receivables  91+ Still Accruing Customer               North America  $  $  $  $  $ 7,192  $ 7,273  $ Europe      2,607  2,675  Asia Pacific      2,316  2,436  Mining       2,084  2,123   Latin America      2,583  2,857  Caterpillar Power Finance      3,079  3,148  Dealer               North America          2,189  2,189   Europe             Asia Pacific             Mining               Latin America             Caterpillar Power Finance               Total  $  $  $  $  $ 23,415  $ 24,066  $                ##TABLE_END Impaired finance receivables  For all classes, a finance receivable is considered impaired, based on current information and events, if it is probable that Cat Financial will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms. Impaired finance receivables include finance receivables that have been restructured and are considered to be troubled debt restructurings.  There were no impaired finance receivables as of December 31, 2015 , 2014 and 2013 for the Dealer portfolio segment. Cat Financials recorded investment in impaired finance receivables and the related unpaid principal balances and allowance for the Customer portfolio segment were as follows: ##TABLE_START  December 31, 2015  December 31, 2014 (Millions of dollars) Recorded Investment  Unpaid Principal Balance  Related Allowance  Recorded Investment  Unpaid Principal Balance  Related Allowance Impaired Finance Receivables With No Allowance Recorded            North America $  $  $   $  $  $  Europe        Asia Pacific        Mining        Latin America        Caterpillar Power Finance        Total $  $  $   $  $  $              Impaired Finance Receivables With An Allowance Recorded            North America $  $  $  $  $  $ Europe      Asia Pacific      Mining      Latin America      Caterpillar Power Finance      Total $  $  $  $  $  $             Total Impaired Finance Receivables            North America $  $  $  $  $  $ Europe      Asia Pacific      Mining      Latin America      Caterpillar Power Finance      Total $  $  $  $  $  $             ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START       ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START   Years ended December 31,     (Millions of dollars)  Average Recorded Investment  Interest Income Recognized  Average Recorded Investment  Interest Income Recognized  Average Recorded Investment  Interest Income Recognized Impaired Finance Receivables With No Allowance Recorded             North America  $  $  $  $  $  $ Europe       Asia Pacific          Mining       Latin America          Caterpillar Power Finance       Total  $  $  $  $  $  $              Impaired Finance Receivables With An Allowance Recorded             North America  $  $   $  $   $  $ Europe       Asia Pacific       Mining        Latin America       Caterpillar Power Finance       Total  $  $  $  $  $  $              Total Impaired Finance Receivables             North America  $  $  $  $  $  $ Europe       Asia Pacific       Mining       Latin America       Caterpillar Power Finance       Total  $  $  $  $  $  $              ##TABLE_END Recognition of income is suspended and the finance receivable is placed on non-accrual status when management determines that collection of future income is not probable (generally after 120 days past due). Recognition is resumed and previously suspended income is recognized when the finance receivable becomes current and collection of remaining amounts is considered probable. Payments received while the finance receivable is on non-accrual status are applied to interest and principal in accordance with the contractual terms.  As of December 31, 2015 and 2014 there were no finance receivable on non-accrual status for the Dealer portfolio segment.  The investment in customer finance receivable on non-accrual status was as follows: ##TABLE_START   December 31, (Millions of dollars)   North America  $  $ Europe   Asia Pacific   Mining   Latin America   Caterpillar Power Finance   Total  $  $      ##TABLE_END Troubled Debt Restructurings  A restructuring of a finance receivable constitutes a troubled debt restructuring (TDR) when the lender grants a concession it would not otherwise consider to a borrower experiencing financial difficulties. Concessions granted may include extended contract maturities, inclusion of interest only periods, below market interest rates, extended skip payment periods and reduction of principal and/or accrued interest.  There were no finance receivables modified as TDRs during the years ended December 31, 2015 , 2014 or 2013 for the Dealer portfolio segment.

During 2013 inventory quantities were reduced. This reduction resulted in a liquidation of LIFO inventory layers carried at lower costs prevailing in prior years as compared with current costs. In 2013, the effect of this reduction of inventory decreased Cost of goods sold by approximately $115 million and increased Profit by approximately $81 million or $0.12 per share. The impact of LIFO liquidations during 2015 and 2014 was not significant to Statement 1. ##TABLE_START 8.

As a result of the sale, we recognized a pretax gain of $120 million (included in Other income (expense)) and derecognized the carrying value of our noncontrolling interest of $57 million , which was previously included in Investments in unconsolidated affiliated companies in Statement 3. The gain on the disposal is included as a reconciling item between Segment profit and Consolidated profit before taxes. The sale of this investment supports Caterpillar's increased focus on growth opportunities in its core businesses. 10. Intangible assets and goodwill ##TABLE_START A.

See Note 24 for details on this acquisition. Gross customer relationship intangibles of $48 million and related accumulated amortization of $9 million were divested during 2014, and are not included in the December 31, 2014 balances in the table above. These transactions were related to the divestiture of portions of the Bucyrus distribution business. See Note 25 for additional information on divestitures. In-process research  development indefinite-lived intangibles of $18 million from the Energy  Transportation segment were impaired during 2014. Fair value of the intangibles was determined using an income approach based on the present value of discounted cash flows. The impairment of $18 million was recognized in Other operating (income) expenses in Statement 1 and included in the Energy  Transportation segment. Finite-lived intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives and tested for impairment if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset may be impaired. Amortization expense related to intangible assets was $337 million , $365 million and $371 million for 2015 , 2014 and 2013 , respectively. As of December 31, 2015 , amortization expense related to intangible assets is expected to be:  ##TABLE_START (Millions of dollars)      Thereafter $  $  $  $  $  $ 1,191            ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START B.

Postemployment benefit plans ##TABLE_END  We provide defined benefit pension plans, defined contribution plans and/or other postretirement benefit plans (retirement health care and life insurance) to employees in many of our locations throughout the world. Our defined benefit pension plans provide a benefit based on years of service and/or the employees average earnings near retirement. Our defined contribution plans allow employees to contribute a portion of their salary to help save for retirement, and in certain cases, we provide a matching contribution. The benefit obligation related to our non-U.S. defined benefit pension plans are for employees located primarily in Europe, Japan and Brazil. For other postretirement benefits, substantially all of our benefit obligation is for employees located in the United States.  Our U.S. defined benefit pension plans for support and management employees were frozen for certain employees on December 31, 2010, and will freeze for remaining employees on December 31, 2019. On the respective transition dates employees move to a retirement benefit that provides a frozen pension benefit and a 401(k) plan that will include a matching contribution and a new annual employer contribution. As discussed in Note 26, during 2015 the company offered a voluntary retirement enhancement program to qualifying U.S. employees. This voluntary program impacted employees participating in certain U.S. pension and other postretirement benefit plans and resulted in a curtailment loss of $86 million , recognized in Other operating (income) expenses in Statement 1. At December 31, 2015, we changed our method for calculating the service and interest cost components of net periodic benefit cost. Historically, these components were determined utilizing a single weighted-average discount rate based on a yield curve used to measure the benefit obligation at the beginning of the period. Beginning in 2016, we have elected to utilize a full yield curve approach in the estimation of the service and interest costs by applying the specific spot rates along the yield curve used in the determination of the benefit obligation to the relevant projected cash flows. We have made this change to provide a more precise measurement of service and interest costs by improving the correlation between the projected cash flows to the corresponding spot rates along the yield curve. This change will have no impact on pension and other postretirement benefit liabilities and will be accounted for prospectively as a change in accounting estimate. At January 1, 2016, we changed our accounting principle for recognizing actuarial gains and losses and expected return on plan assets for our pension and other postretirement benefit plans to a more preferable policy under U.S. GAAP. Prior to 2016, actuarial gains and losses were recognized as a component of Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), and were generally amortized into earnings in future periods. Under the new principle, actuarial gains and losses will be immediately recognized through earnings upon the annual remeasurement in the fourth quarter, or on an interim basis as triggering events warrant remeasurement. In addition, we changed our policy for recognizing expected returns on plan assets from a market-related value method (based on a three-year smoothing of asset returns) to a fair value method. We believe that these changes are preferable as they provide greater transparency of our economic obligations in accounting results and better align with the fair value accounting principles by recognizing the effects of economic and interest rate changes on pension and other postretirement benefit assets and liabilities in the year in which the gains and losses are incurred. These changes will be applied retrospectively to prior years. ##TABLE_START A.

The current U.S. pension target asset allocations are 45 percent equities and 55 percent fixed income. These target allocations will be revisited periodically to ensure that they reflect our overall objectives. The non-U.S. pension weighted-average target allocations are 41 percent equities, 51 percent fixed income, 5 percent real estate and 3 percent other. The target allocations for each plan vary based upon local statutory requirements, demographics of plan participants and funded status. The non-U.S. plan assets are primarily invested in non-U.S. securities.  Our target allocations for the other postretirement benefit plans are 70 percent equities and 30 percent fixed income.  The U.S. plans are rebalanced to plus or minus 5 percentage points of the target asset allocation ranges on a monthly basis. The frequency of rebalancing for the non-U.S. plans varies depending on the plan. As a result of our diversification strategies, there are no significant concentrations of risk within the portfolio of investments.  The use of certain derivative instruments is permitted where appropriate and necessary for achieving overall investment policy objectives. The plans do not engage in derivative contracts for speculative purposes.  The accounting guidance on fair value measurements specifies a fair value hierarchy based upon the observability of inputs used in valuation techniques (Level 1, 2 and 3). See Note 18 for a discussion of the fair value hierarchy.  Fair values are determined as follows:  ##TABLE_START  Equity securities are primarily based on valuations for identical instruments in active markets. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Fixed income securities are primarily based upon models that take into consideration such market-based factors as recent sales, risk-free yield curves and prices of similarly rated bonds. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Real estate is stated at the funds net asset value or at appraised value. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Cash, short-term instruments and other are based on the carrying amount, which approximates fair value, or the funds net asset value. ##TABLE_END The fair value of the pension and other postretirement benefit plan assets by category is summarized below:  ##TABLE_START   December 31, 2015 (Millions of dollars)  Level 1  Level 2  Level 3  Total Assets, at Fair Value U.S. Pension         Equity securities:         U.S. equities  $ 2,976  $   $  $ 3,148 Non-U.S. equities  2,044    2,050          Fixed income securities:         U.S. corporate bonds    4,004   4,046 Non-U.S. corporate bonds       U.S. government bonds       U.S. governmental agency mortgage-backed securities       Non-U.S. government bonds                Real estate                Cash, short-term instruments and other     Total U.S. pension assets  $ 5,177  $ 6,036  $  $ 11,440 ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START   December 31, 2014 (Millions of dollars)  Level 1  Level 2  Level 3  Total Assets, at Fair Value U.S. Pension         Equity securities:         U.S. equities  $ 3,713  $  $  $ 3,875 Non-U.S. equities  2,291    2,304          Fixed income securities:         U.S. corporate bonds    3,985   4,010 Non-U.S. corporate bonds       U.S. government bonds       U.S. governmental agency mortgage-backed securities      Non-U.S. government bonds               Real estate                Cash, short-term instruments and other      Total U.S. pension assets  $ 6,041  $ 6,289  $  $ 12,530 ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START          ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START   December 31, 2015 (Millions of dollars)  Level 1  Level 2  Level 3  Total Assets,  at Fair Value Non-U.S. Pension         Equity securities:         U.S. equities  $  $  $   $ Non-U.S. equities     Global equities 1               Fixed income securities:         U.S. corporate bonds      Non-U.S. corporate bonds      U.S. government bonds       Non-U.S. government bonds    1,083    1,083 Global fixed income 1                Real estate                Cash, short-term instruments and other 2      Total non-U.S. pension assets  $ 1,322  $ 2,561  $  $ 3,890 ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START   December 31, 2014 (Millions of dollars)  Level 1  Level 2  Level 3  Total Assets, at Fair Value Non-U.S. Pension         Equity securities:         U.S. equities  $  $   $   $ Non-U.S. equities      1,044 Global equities 1               Fixed income securities:         U.S. corporate bonds      Non-U.S. corporate bonds      U.S. government bonds       Non-U.S. government bonds       Global fixed income 1                Real estate               Cash, short-term instruments and other 2      Total non-U.S. pension assets  $ 1,723  $ 2,318  $  $ 4,100 ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START          ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START 1  Includes funds that invest in both U.S. and non-U.S. securities. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START 2  Includes funds that invest in multiple asset classes, hedge funds and other. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START      ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START   December 31, 2015 (Millions of dollars)  Level 1  Level 2  Level 3  Total Assets, at Fair Value Other Postretirement Benefits         Equity securities:         U.S. equities  $  $  $   $ Non-U.S. equities                Fixed income securities:         U.S. corporate bonds       Non-U.S. corporate bonds       U.S. government bonds       U.S. governmental agency mortgage-backed securities       Non-U.S. government bonds                Cash, short-term instruments and other      Total other postretirement benefit assets  $  $  $   $ ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START   December 31, 2014 (Millions of dollars)  Level 1  Level 2  Level 3  Total Assets, at Fair Value Other Postretirement Benefits         Equity securities:         U.S. equities  $  $   $   $ Non-U.S. equities               Fixed income securities:         U.S. corporate bonds       Non-U.S. corporate bonds       U.S. government bonds       U.S. governmental agency mortgage-backed securities       Non-U.S. government bonds                Cash, short-term instruments and other      Total other postretirement benefit assets  $  $  $   $ ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START          ##TABLE_ENDBelow are roll-forwards of assets measured at fair value using Level 3 inputs for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 .

For pension plans in which all or almost all of the plan's participants are inactive and other postretirement benefit plans in which all or almost all of the plan's participants are fully eligible for benefits under the plan, prior service cost (credit) are amortized using the straight-line method over the remaining life expectancy of those participants. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START 5  Net actuarial loss (gain) for pension and other postretirement benefit plans are generally amortized using the straight-line method over the average remaining service period of active employees expected to receive benefits from the plan. For plans in which all or almost all of the plans participants are inactive, net actuarial loss (gain) are amortized using the straight-line method over the remaining life expectancy of the inactive participants. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START 6  The weighted-average rates for 2016 are 6.9 percent and 6.1 percent for U.S. and non-U.S. pension plans, respectively. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START      ##TABLE_ENDThe assumed discount rate is used to discount future benefit obligations back to todays dollars. The U.S. discount rate is based on a benefit cash flow-matching approach and represents the rate at which our benefit obligations could effectively be settled as of our measurement date, December 31. The benefit cash flow-matching approach involves analyzing Caterpillars projected cash flows against a high quality bond yield curve, calculated using a wide population of corporate Aa bonds available on the measurement date. The very highest and lowest yielding bonds (top and bottom 10 percent ) are excluded from the analysis. A similar process is used to determine the assumed discount rate for our most significant non-U.S. plans. This rate is sensitive to changes in interest rates. A decrease in the discount rate would increase our obligation and future expense.  Our U.S. expected long-term rate of return on plan assets is based on our estimate of long-term passive returns for equities and fixed income securities weighted by the allocation of our pension assets. Based on historical performance, we increase the passive returns due to our active management of the plan assets. To arrive at our expected long-term return, the amount added for active management was 0.95 percent for 2015 and 1 percent for 2014 and 2013 . A similar process is used to determine this rate for our non-U.S. plans.  The assumed health care trend rate represents the rate at which health care costs are assumed to increase. We assumed a weighted-average increase of 6.6 percent in our calculation of 2015 benefit expense. We expect a weighted-average increase of 6.5 percent during 2016. The 2016 rates are assumed to decrease gradually to the ultimate health care trend rate of 5 percent in 2021 . This rate represents 3 percent general inflation plus 2 percent additional health care inflation. ##TABLE_START F. Other postemployment benefit plans ##TABLE_END  We offer long-term disability benefits, continued health care for disabled employees, survivor income benefit insurance and supplemental unemployment benefits to substantially all U.S. employees. ##TABLE_START G. Defined contribution plans ##TABLE_END  We have both U.S. and non-U.S. employee defined contribution plans to help employees save for retirement. Our primary U.S. 401(k) plan allows eligible employees to contribute a portion of their cash compensation to the plan on a tax-deferred basis. Employees with frozen defined benefit pension accruals are eligible for matching contributions equal to 100 percent of employee contributions to the plan up to 6 percent of cash compensation and an annual employer contribution that ranges from 3 to 5 percent of cash compensation (depending on years of service and age). Employees that are still accruing benefits under a defined benefit pension plan are eligible for matching contributions equal to 50 percent of employee contributions up to 6 percent of cash compensation. These 401(k) plans include various investments funds, including a non-leveraged employee stock ownership plan (ESOP). As of December 31, 2015 and 2014 the ESOP held 26.4 million and 26.2 million  shares, respectively. All of the shares held by the ESOP were allocated to participant accounts. Dividends paid to participants are automatically reinvested into company shares unless the participant elects to have all or a portion of the dividend paid to the participant. Various other U.S. and non-U.S. defined contribution plans allow eligible employees to contribute a portion of their salary to the plans, and in some cases, we provide a matching contribution to the funds.  Total company costs related to U.S. and non-U.S. defined contribution plans were as follows:  ##TABLE_START (Millions of dollars)    U.S. plans  $  $  $ Non-U.S. plans      $  $  $        ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START H.

Based on management's allocation decision, which can be revised from time to time, the portion of the Credit Facility available to Machinery, Energy  Transportation as of December 31, 2015 was $2.75 billion . Our three Global Credit Facilities are:  ##TABLE_START  The 364 -day facility of $3.15 billion (of which $0.82 billion is available to Machinery, Energy  Transportation) expires in September 2016. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  The three -year facility, as amended and restated in September 2015, of $2.73 billion (of which $0.72 billion is available to Machinery, Energy  Transportation) expires in September 2018. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  The five -year facility, as amended and restated in September 2015, of $4.62 billion (of which $1.21 billion is available to Machinery, Energy  Transportation) expires in September 2020. ##TABLE_END Other consolidated credit lines with banks as of December 31, 2015 totaled $3.75 billion . These committed and uncommitted credit lines, which may be eligible for renewal at various future dates or have no specified expiration date, are used primarily by our subsidiaries for local funding requirements. Caterpillar or Cat Financial may guarantee subsidiary borrowings under these lines. At December 31, 2015 , Caterpillar's consolidated net worth was $19.92 billion , which was above the $9.00 billion required under the Credit Facility. The consolidated net worth is defined as the consolidated stockholder's equity including preferred stock but excluding the pension and other postretirement benefits balance within Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). At December 31, 2015 , Cat Financial's covenant interest coverage ratio was 2.05 to 1 . This is above the 1.15 to 1 minimum ratio, calculated as (1) profit excluding income taxes, interest expense and net gain/(loss) from interest rate derivatives to (2) interest expense calculated at the end of each calendar quarter for the rolling four quarter period then most recently ended, required by the Credit Facility. In addition, at December 31, 2015 , Cat Financial's six-month covenant leverage ratio was 7.49 to 1 and year-end covenant leverage ratio was 7.93 to 1 . This is below the maximum ratio of debt to net worth of 10 to 1 , calculated (1) on a monthly basis as the average of the leverage ratios determined on the last day of each of the six preceding calendar months and (2) at each December 31, required by the Credit Facility. In the event Caterpillar or Cat Financial does not meet one or more of their respective financial covenants under the Credit Facility in the future (and are unable to obtain a consent or waiver), the syndicate of banks may terminate the commitments allocated to the party that does not meet its covenants. Additionally, in such event, certain of Cat Financial's other lenders under other loan agreements where similar financial covenants or cross default provisions are applicable, may, at their election, choose to pursue remedies under those loan agreements, including accelerating the repayment of outstanding borrowings. At December 31, 2015 , there were no borrowings under the Credit Facility.  ##TABLE_START 16.

Fair value measurements ##TABLE_END  The guidance on fair value measurements defines fair value as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants. This guidance also specifies a fair value hierarchy based upon the observability of inputs used in valuation techniques. Observable inputs (highest level) reflect market data obtained from independent sources, while unobservable inputs (lowest level) reflect internally developed market assumptions. In accordance with this guidance, fair value measurements are classified under the following hierarchy:  ##TABLE_START  Level 1   Quoted prices for identical instruments in active markets. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  Level 2  Quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active; and model-derived valuations in which all significant inputs or significant value-drivers are observable in active markets. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  Level 3  Model-derived valuations in which one or more significant inputs or significant value-drivers are unobservable. ##TABLE_END  When available, we use quoted market prices to determine fair value, and we classify such measurements within Level 1. In some cases where market prices are not available, we make use of observable market based inputs to calculate fair value, in which case the measurements are classified within Level 2. If quoted or observable market prices are not available, fair value is based upon valuations in which one or more significant inputs are unobservable, including internally developed models that use, where possible, current market-based parameters such as interest rates, yield curves and currency rates. These measurements are classified within Level 3. Fair value measurements are classified according to the lowest level input or value-driver that is significant to the valuation. A measurement may therefore be classified within Level 3 even though there may be significant inputs that are readily observable.  Fair value measurement includes the consideration of nonperformance risk. Nonperformance risk refers to the risk that an obligation (either by a counterparty or Caterpillar) will not be fulfilled. For financial assets traded in an active market (Level 1 and certain Level 2), the nonperformance risk is included in the market price. For certain other financial assets and liabilities (certain Level 2 and Level 3), our fair value calculations have been adjusted accordingly.  Available-for-sale securities Our available-for-sale securities, primarily at Insurance Services, include a mix of equity and debt instruments (see Note 11 for additional information). Fair values for our U.S. treasury bonds and large capitalization value and smaller company growth equity securities are based upon valuations for identical instruments in active markets. The fair value of our investment in a real estate investment trust (REIT) is based on the net asset value (NAV) of the investment. Fair values for other government bonds, corporate bonds and mortgage-backed debt securities are based upon models that take into consideration such market-based factors as recent sales, risk-free yield curves and prices of similarly rated bonds.  Derivative financial instruments The fair value of interest rate swap derivatives is primarily based on models that utilize the appropriate market-based forward swap curves and zero-coupon interest rates to determine discounted cash flows. The fair value of foreign currency and commodity forward, option and cross currency contracts is based on a valuation model that discounts cash flows resulting from the differential between the contract price and the market-based forward rate. Assets and liabilities measured on a recurring basis at fair value, primarily related to Financial Products, included in Statement 3 as of December 31, 2015 and 2014 are summarized below: ##TABLE_START   December 31, 2015 (Millions of dollars)  Level 1  Level 2  Level 3  Total Assets / Liabilities, at Fair Value Assets         Available-for-sale securities         Government debt         U.S. treasury bonds  $  $   $   $ Other U.S. and non-U.S. government bonds                Corporate bonds         Corporate bonds       Asset-backed securities                Mortgage-backed debt securities         U.S. governmental agency       Residential       Commercial                Equity securities         Large capitalization value       REIT       Smaller company growth       Total available-for-sale securities   1,274   1,635          Derivative financial instruments, net       Total Assets  $  $ 1,323  $  $ 1,684          ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START   December 31, 2014 (Millions of dollars)  Level 1  Level 2  Level 3  Total Assets / Liabilities, at Fair Value Assets         Available-for-sale securities         Government debt         U.S. treasury bonds  $  $   $   $ Other U.S. and non-U.S. government bonds                Corporate bonds         Corporate bonds       Asset-backed securities                Mortgage-backed debt securities         U.S. governmental agency       Residential       Commercial                Equity securities         Large capitalization value       Smaller company growth       Total available-for-sale securities   1,268    1,554          Total Assets  $  $ 1,268  $   $ 1,554          Liabilities         Derivative financial instruments, net  $   $  $   $ Total Liabilities  $   $  $   $          ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START          ##TABLE_ENDThe fair value of our REIT investment is measured based on NAV, which is considered a Level 3 input. A roll-forward of our REIT investment for the year ended December 31, 2015 is as follows: ##TABLE_START (Millions of dollars)  REIT Balance at December 31, 2014  $  Purchases of securities  Sale of securities   Gains (losses) included in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss)   Balance at December 31, 2015  $    ##TABLE_END In addition to the amounts above, Cat Financial impaired loans are subject to measurement at fair value on a nonrecurring basis and are classified as Level 3 measurements. A loan is considered impaired when management determines that collection of contractual amounts due is not probable. In these cases, an allowance for credit losses may be established based either on the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the receivables' effective interest rate, or the fair value of the collateral for collateral-dependent receivables. In determining collateral value, Cat Financial estimates the current fair market value of the collateral less selling costs. Cat Financial had impaired loans with a fair value of $91 million and $248 million for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 , respectively.  ##TABLE_START B. Fair values of financial instruments ##TABLE_END  In addition to the methods and assumptions we use to record the fair value of financial instruments as discussed in the Fair value measurements section above, we used the following methods and assumptions to estimate the fair value of our financial instruments:  Cash and short-term investments Carrying amount approximated fair value.  Restricted cash and short-term investments Carrying amount approximated fair value. Restricted cash and short-term investments are included in Prepaid expenses and other current assets in Statement 3.  Finance receivables Fair value was estimated by discounting the future cash flows using current rates, representative of receivables with similar remaining maturities.  Wholesale inventory receivables Fair value was estimated by discounting the future cash flows using current rates, representative of receivables with similar remaining maturities.  Short-term borrowings Carrying amount approximated fair value.  Long-term debt Fair value for fixed and floating rate debt was estimated based on quoted market prices. Guarantees The fair value of guarantees is based upon our estimate of the premium a market participant would require to issue the same guarantee in a stand-alone arms-length transaction with an unrelated party. If quoted or observable market prices are not available, fair value is based upon internally developed models that utilize current market-based assumptions.

Concentration of credit risk ##TABLE_END  Financial instruments with potential credit risk consist primarily of trade and finance receivables and short-term and long-term investments. Additionally, to a lesser extent, we have a potential credit risk associated with counterparties to derivative contracts.  Trade receivables are primarily short-term receivables from independently owned and operated dealers and customers which arise in the normal course of business. We perform regular credit evaluations of our dealers and customers. Collateral generally is not required, and the majority of our trade receivables are unsecured. We do, however, when deemed necessary, make use of various devices such as security agreements and letters of credit to protect our interests. No single dealer or customer represents a significant concentration of credit risk.  Finance receivables and wholesale inventory receivables primarily represent receivables under installment sales contracts, receivables arising from leasing transactions and notes receivable. We generally maintain a secured interest in the equipment financed. No single customer or dealer represents a significant concentration of credit risk.  Short-term and long-term investments are held with high quality institutions and, by policy, the amount of credit exposure to any one institution is limited. Long-term investments, primarily included in Other assets in Statement 3, are comprised primarily of available-for-sale securities at Insurance Services.  For derivative contracts, collateral is generally not required of the counterparties or of our company. The company generally enters into International Swaps and Derivatives Association (ISDA) master netting agreements within Machinery, Energy  Transportation and Financial Products that permit the net settlement of amounts owed under their respective derivative contracts. Our exposure to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the counterparties is limited to only those gains that we have recorded, but for which we have not yet received cash payment. The master netting agreements reduce the amount of loss the company would incur should the counterparties fail to meet their obligations. At December 31, 2015 and 2014 , the maximum exposure to credit loss was $105 million and $128 million , respectively, before the application of any master netting agreements. Please refer to Note 18 and Table III above for fair value information.  ##TABLE_START 20. Operating leases ##TABLE_END  We lease certain computer and communications equipment, transportation equipment and other property through operating leases. Total rental expense for operating leases was $371 million , $391 million and $436 million for 2015 , 2014 and 2013 , respectively.  Minimum payments for operating leases having initial or remaining non-cancelable terms in excess of one year are:  ##TABLE_START Years ended December 31, (Millions of dollars)      Thereafter  Total $  $  $  $  $  $  $              ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START 21. Guarantees and product warranty ##TABLE_END  Caterpillar dealer performance guarantees We have provided an indemnity to a third-party insurance company for potential losses related to performance bonds issued on behalf of Caterpillar dealers. The bonds have varying terms and are issued to insure governmental agencies against nonperformance by certain dealers. We also provided guarantees to third-parties related to the performance of contractual obligations by certain Caterpillar dealers. These guarantees have varying terms and cover potential financial losses incurred by the third-parties resulting from the dealers nonperformance.  Customer loan guarantees We provide loan guarantees to third-party lenders for financing associated with machinery purchased by customers. These guarantees have varying terms and are secured by the machinery. In addition, Cat Financial participates in standby letters of credit issued to third parties on behalf of their customers. These standby letters of credit have varying terms and beneficiaries and are secured by customer assets. Supplier consortium performance guarantee We have provided a guarantee to one of our customers in Brazil related to the performance of contractual obligations by a supplier consortium to which one of our Caterpillar subsidiaries is a member. The guarantee covers potential damages (some of them capped) incurred by the customer resulting from the supplier consortiums non-performance. The guarantee will expire when the supplier consortium performs all its contractual obligations, which is expected to be completed in 2025. Third party logistics business lease guarantees We have provided guarantees to third-party lessors for certain properties leased by a third party logistics business, formerly Caterpillar Logistics Services LCC, in which we sold our 35 percent equity interest in the first quarter of 2015 (see Note 9). The guarantees are for the possibility that the third party logistics business would default on real estate lease payments. The guarantees were granted at lease inception and generally will expire at the end of the lease terms. No significant loss has been experienced or is anticipated under any of these guarantees. At December 31, 2015 and 2014 , the related liability was $12 million . The maximum potential amount of future payments (undiscounted and without reduction for any amounts that may possibly be recovered under recourse or collateralized provisions) we could be required to make under the guarantees at December 31 are as follows:  ##TABLE_START (Millions of dollars)   Caterpillar dealer performance guarantees  $  $ Customer loan guarantees   Supplier consortium performance guarantee   Third party logistics business lease guarantees   Other guarantees   Total guarantees  $  $      ##TABLE_END Cat Financial provides guarantees to repurchase certain loans of Caterpillar dealers from a special-purpose corporation (SPC) that qualifies as a variable interest entity. The purpose of the SPC is to provide short-term working capital loans to Caterpillar dealers. This SPC issues commercial paper and uses the proceeds to fund its loan program. Cat Financial has a loan purchase agreement with the SPC that obligates Cat Financial to purchase certain loans that are not paid at maturity. Cat Financial receives a fee for providing this guarantee, which provides a source of liquidity for the SPC. Cat Financial is the primary beneficiary of the SPC as its guarantees result in Cat Financial having both the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the SPCs economic performance and the obligation to absorb losses, and therefore Cat Financial has consolidated the financial statements of the SPC. As of December 31, 2015 and 2014 , the SPCs assets of $1,211 million and $1,086 million , respectively, were primarily comprised of loans to dealers, and the SPCs liabilities of $1,210 million and $1,085 million , respectively, were primarily comprised of commercial paper. The assets of the SPC are not available to pay Cat Financial's creditors. Cat Financial may be obligated to perform under the guarantee if the SPC experiences losses. No loss has been experienced or is anticipated under this loan purchase agreement.  Cat Financial is party to agreements in the normal course of business with selected customers and Caterpillar dealers in which they commit to provide a set dollar amount of financing on a pre-approved basis. They also provide lines of credit to certain customers and Caterpillar dealers, of which a portion remains unused as of the end of the period. Commitments and lines of credit generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses. It has been Cat Financial's experience that not all commitments and lines of credit will be used. Management applies the same credit policies when making commitments and granting lines of credit as it does for any other financing.  Cat Financial does not require collateral for these commitments/lines, but if credit is extended, collateral may be required upon funding. The amount of the unused commitments and lines of credit for dealers as of December 31, 2015 and 2014 was $12,920 million and $12,412 million , respectively. The amount of the unused commitments and lines of credit for customers as of December 31, 2015 and 2014 was $3,567 million and $4,005 million , respectively.  Our product warranty liability is determined by applying historical claim rate experience to the current field population and dealer inventory. Generally, historical claim rates are based on actual warranty experience for each product by machine model/engine size by customer or dealer location (inside or outside North America). Specific rates are developed for each product shipment month and are updated monthly based on actual warranty claim experience.  ##TABLE_START (Millions of dollars)    Warranty liability, January 1  $ 1,426  $ 1,367  Reduction in liability (payments)  (874 )  (1,071 )  Increase in liability (new warranties)   1,130 1  Warranty liability, December 31  $ 1,354  $ 1,426        ##TABLE_END1 The increase in liability includes approximately $170 million for changes in estimates for pre-existing warranties due to higher than expected actual warranty claim experience. ##TABLE_START      ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START 22. Environmental and legal matters ##TABLE_END  The Company is regulated by federal, state and international environmental laws governing our use, transport and disposal of substances and control of emissions. In addition to governing our manufacturing and other operations, these laws often impact the development of our products, including, but not limited to, required compliance with air emissions standards applicable to internal combustion engines. We have made, and will continue to make, significant research and development and capital expenditures to comply with these emissions standards. We are engaged in remedial activities at a number of locations, often with other companies, pursuant to federal and state laws. When it is probable we will pay remedial costs at a site, and those costs can be reasonably estimated, the investigation, remediation, and operating and maintenance costs are accrued against our earnings. Costs are accrued based on consideration of currently available data and information with respect to each individual site, including available technologies, current applicable laws and regulations, and prior remediation experience. Where no amount within a range of estimates is more likely, we accrue the minimum. Where multiple potentially responsible parties are involved, we consider our proportionate share of the probable costs. In formulating the estimate of probable costs, we do not consider amounts expected to be recovered from insurance companies or others. We reassess these accrued amounts on a quarterly basis. The amount recorded for environmental remediation is not material and is included in Accrued expenses. We believe there is no more than a remote chance that a material amount for remedial activities at any individual site, or at all the sites in the aggregate, will be required. On January 8, 2015, the Company received a grand jury subpoena from the U.S. District Court for the Central District of Illinois. The subpoena requests documents and information from the Company relating to, among other things, financial information concerning U.S. and non-U.S. Caterpillar subsidiaries (including undistributed profits of non-U.S. subsidiaries and the movement of cash among U.S. and non-U.S. subsidiaries). The Company has received additional subpoenas relating to this investigation requesting additional documents and information relating to, among other things, the purchase and resale of replacement parts by Caterpillar Inc. and non-U.S. Caterpillar subsidiaries, dividend distributions of certain non-U.S. Caterpillar subsidiaries, and Caterpillar SARL and related structures. The Company is cooperating with this investigation. The Company is unable to predict the outcome or reasonably estimate any potential loss; however, we currently believe that this matter will not have a material adverse effect on the Companys consolidated results of operations, financial position or liquidity. On September 12, 2014, the SEC notified the Company that it was conducting an informal investigation relating to Caterpillar SARL and related structures. On December 8, 2015, the Company was notified by the SEC that it concluded its investigation relating to Caterpillar SARL and related structures and that it did not intend to recommend an enforcement action. On September 10, 2014, the SEC issued to Caterpillar a subpoena seeking information concerning the Companys accounting for the goodwill relating to its acquisition of Bucyrus International Inc. in 2011 and related matters. The Company has received additional subpoenas relating to this investigation, and the Company is cooperating with the SEC regarding its ongoing investigation. The Company is unable to predict the outcome or reasonably estimate any potential loss; however, we currently believe that this matter will not have a material adverse effect on the Company's consolidated results of operations, financial position or liquidity. On March 20, 2014, Brazils Administrative Council for Economic Defense (CADE) published a Technical Opinion which named 18 companies and over 100 individuals as defendants, including two subsidiaries of Caterpillar Inc., MGE - Equipamentos e Servios Ferrovirios Ltda. (MGE) and Caterpillar Brasil Ltda. The publication of the Technical Opinion opened CADE's official administrative investigation into allegations that the defendants participated in anticompetitive bid activity for the construction and maintenance of metro and train networks in Brazil. While companies cannot be held criminally liable for anticompetitive conduct in Brazil, criminal charges have been brought against two current employees of MGE and one former employee of MGE involving the same conduct alleged by CADE. The Company has responded to all requests for information from the authorities. The Company is unable to predict the outcome or reasonably estimate the potential loss; however, we currently believe that this matter will not have a material adverse effect on the Company's consolidated results of operations, financial position or liquidity. On October 24, 2013, Progress Rail received a grand jury subpoena from the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California. The subpoena requests documents and information from Progress Rail, United Industries Corporation, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Progress Rail, and Caterpillar Inc. relating to allegations that Progress Rail conducted improper or unnecessary railcar inspections and repairs and improperly disposed of parts, equipment, tools and other items. In connection with this subpoena, Progress Rail was informed by the U.S. Attorney for the Central District of California that it is a target of a criminal investigation into potential violations of environmental laws and alleged improper business practices. The Company is cooperating with the authorities and is currently in discussions regarding a potential resolution of the matter. Although the Company believes a loss is probable, we currently believe that this matter will not have a material adverse effect on the Company's consolidated results of operations, financial position or liquidity. In addition, we are involved in other unresolved legal actions that arise in the normal course of business. The most prevalent of these unresolved actions involve disputes related to product design, manufacture and performance liability (including claimed asbestos and welding fumes exposure), contracts, employment issues, environmental matters or intellectual property rights. The aggregate range of reasonably possible losses in excess of accrued liabilities, if any, associated with these unresolved legal actions is not material. In some cases, we cannot reasonably estimate a range of loss because there is insufficient information regarding the matter. However, we believe there is no more than a remote chance that any liability arising from these matters would be material. Although it is not possible to predict with certainty the outcome of these unresolved legal actions, we believe that these actions will not individually or in the aggregate have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations, financial position or liquidity. ##TABLE_START 23. Segment information ##TABLE_END  ##TABLE_START A. Basis for segment information ##TABLE_END  Our Executive Office is comprised of five Group Presidents, a Senior Vice President, an Executive Vice President and a CEO. Group Presidents are accountable for a related set of end-to-end businesses that they manage. The Senior Vice President leads the Caterpillar Enterprise System Group and the Executive Vice President leads the Law and Public Policy Division. The CEO allocates resources and manages performance at the Group President level. As such, the CEO serves as our Chief Operating Decision Maker and operating segments are primarily based on the Group President reporting structure.  Three of our operating segments, Construction Industries, Resource Industries and Energy  Transportation are led by Group Presidents. One operating segment, Financial Products, is led by a Group President who also has responsibility for Corporate Services. Corporate Services is a cost center primarily responsible for the performance of certain support functions globally and to provide centralized services; it does not meet the definition of an operating segment. One Group President leads three smaller operating segments that are included in the All Other operating segments. The Caterpillar Enterprise System Group and Law and Public Policy Division are cost centers and do not meet the definition of an operating segment. Effective January 1, 2015, responsibility for product management for certain components moved from Resource Industries to Energy  Transportation. Segment information for 2014 and 2013 has been retrospectively adjusted to conform to the 2015 presentation.  B.  Description of segments  We have seven operating segments, of which four are reportable segments. Following is a brief description of our reportable segments and the business activities included in the All Other operating segments:  Construction Industries : A segment primarily responsible for supporting customers using machinery in infrastructure and building construction applications.

Inter-segment sales are a source of revenue for this segment.  Financial Products Segment : Provides financing to customers and dealers for the purchase and lease of Caterpillar and other equipment, as well as some financing for Caterpillar sales to dealers. Financing plans include operating and finance leases, installment sale contracts, working capital loans and wholesale financing plans. The segment also provides various forms of insurance to customers and dealers to help support the purchase and lease of our equipment.  All Other operating segments :  Primarily includes activities such as: the remanufacturing of Cat engines and components and remanufacturing services for other companies as well as the business strategy, product management, development, manufacturing, marketing and product support of undercarriage, specialty products, hardened bar stock components and ground engaging tools primarily for Cat products, paving products, forestry products and industrial and waste products; the product management, development, marketing, sales and product support of on-highway vocational trucks for North America; parts distribution; distribution services responsible for dealer development and administration including a wholly-owned dealer in Japan, dealer portfolio management and ensuring the most efficient and effective distribution of machines, engines and parts. Results for the All Other operating segments are included as a reconciling item between reportable segments and consolidated external reporting.  C.  Segment measurement and reconciliations  There are several methodology differences between our segment reporting and our external reporting. The following is a list of the more significant methodology differences:  ##TABLE_START  Machinery, Energy  Transportation segment net assets generally include inventories, receivables, property, plant and equipment, goodwill, intangibles, accounts payable and customer advances. Liabilities other than accounts payable and customer advances are generally managed at the corporate level and are not included in segment operations. Financial Products Segment assets generally include all categories of assets. ##TABLE_END  ##TABLE_START  Segment inventories and cost of sales are valued using a current cost methodology. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  Goodwill allocated to segments is amortized using a fixed amount based on a 20 year useful life. This methodology difference only impacts segment assets; no goodwill amortization expense is included in segment profit. In addition, only a portion of goodwill for certain acquisitions made in 2011 or later has been allocated to segments. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  The present value of future lease payments for certain Machinery, Energy  Transportation operating leases is included in segment assets. The estimated financing component of the lease payments is excluded. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  Currency exposures for Machinery, Energy  Transportation are generally managed at the corporate level and the effects of changes in exchange rates on results of operations within the year are not included in segment profit. The net difference created in the translation of revenues and costs between exchange rates used for U.S. GAAP reporting and exchange rates used for segment reporting is recorded as a methodology difference. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  Postretirement benefit expenses are split; segments are generally responsible for service and prior service costs, with the remaining elements of net periodic benefit cost included as a methodology difference. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  Machinery, Energy  Transportation segment profit is determined on a pretax basis and excludes interest expense and other income/expense items. Financial Products Segment profit is determined on a pretax basis and includes other income/expense items. ##TABLE_END Reconciling items are created based on accounting differences between segment reporting and our consolidated external reporting. Please refer to pages 139 to 144 for financial information regarding significant reconciling items. Most of our reconciling items are self-explanatory given the above explanations. For the reconciliation of profit, we have grouped the reconciling items as follows:  ##TABLE_START  Corporate costs: These costs are related to corporate requirements and strategies that are considered to be for the benefit of the entire organization. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  Restructuring costs: Primarily costs for employee separations, long-lived asset impairments and contract terminations. In 2015, restructuring costs also include costs related to our restructuring programs. These costs were primarily for accelerated depreciation and inventory write-downs. A table, Reconciliation of Restructuring costs on page 141, has been included to illustrate how segment profit would have been impacted by the restructuring costs. See Note 26 for more information. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  Methodology differences: See previous discussion of significant accounting differences between segment reporting and consolidated external reporting. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  Timing: Timing differences in the recognition of costs between segment reporting and consolidated external reporting. For example, certain costs are reported on the cash basis for segment reporting and the accrual basis for consolidated external reporting. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START Segment Information (Millions of

In December 2015, we acquired 100 percent of the stock of RDS Manufacturing, Inc. (RDS). RDS, located in Broken Arrow, Oklahoma, is a privately owned manufacturer of highly engineered turbomachinery parts, primarily for the turbine engine and aerospace markets. The acquisition of RDS is expected to help grow our turbine business and deepen our manufacturing expertise. The purchase price, net of $1 million of acquired cash and $5 million of trade receivables due from Caterpillar, was approximately $85 million . We paid $74 million at closing with an additional $11 million to be paid in December 2017. The transaction was financed with available cash. Tangible assets acquired of $28 million , recorded at their fair values, were primarily inventories of $12 million and property, plant and equipment of $16 million . Liabilities assumed as of the acquisition date were $2 million , which represented their fair values. Goodwill of $59 million , substantially all of which is deductible for income tax purposes, represented the excess of the consideration transferred over the net assets recognized and represented the estimated future economic benefits arising from other assets acquired that could not be individually identified and separately recognized. Factors that contributed to a purchase price resulting in the recognition of goodwill include RDSs strategic fit into our manufacturing and product portfolio and the acquired assembled workforce. The results of the acquired business for the period from the acquisition date are included in the accompanying consolidated financial statements and are reported in the Energy  Transportation segment. Assuming this transaction had been made at the beginning of any period presented, the consolidated pro forma results would not be materially different from reported results. Rail Product Solutions, Inc. In October 2015, we acquired 100 percent of the stock in privately owned Rail Product Solutions, Inc. (RPS) from Amsted Rail Company, Inc. RPS is a leading North American provider of mission critical track fastening products and integrated fastening systems. The acquisition of RPS expands our portfolio of track related products and allows us to provide more comprehensive solutions to our customers. The purchase price was approximately $165 million , consisting of $166 million paid at closing less an estimated net working capital adjustment of $1 million anticipated to be finalized in 2016. The transaction was financed with available cash. Tangible assets acquired of $41 million , recorded at their fair values, were primarily receivables of $9 million , inventories of $6 million , property, plant and equipment of $17 million and an investment in an unconsolidated affiliated company of $9 million . Finite-lived intangible assets acquired of $82 million were primarily customer relationships and are being amortized on a straight-line basis over a weighted average period of approximately 15 years . Liabilities assumed as of the acquisition date were $11 million , which represented their fair values. Goodwill of $53 million , substantially all of which is deductible for income tax purposes, represented the excess of the consideration transferred over the net assets recognized and represented the estimated future economic benefits arising from other assets acquired that could not be individually identified and separately recognized. Factors that contributed to a purchase price resulting in the recognition of goodwill include RPSs strategic fit into our product and services portfolio and the acquired assembled workforce. The results of the acquired business for the period from the acquisition date are included in the accompanying consolidated financial statements and are reported in the Energy  Transportation segment. Assuming this transaction had been made at the beginning of any period presented, the consolidated pro forma results would not be materially different from reported results. Johan Walter Berg AB In September 2013, we acquired 100 percent of the stock of Johan Walter Berg AB (Berg). Berg is a leading manufacturer of mechanically and electrically driven propulsion systems and marine controls for ships. Headquartered in cker Islands, Sweden, Berg has designed and manufactured heavy-duty marine thrusters and controllable pitch propellers since 1929. Its proprietary systems are employed in maritime applications throughout the world that require precise maneuvering and positioning. With the acquisition, Caterpillar will transition from selling only engines and generators to providing complete marine propulsion package systems. The purchase price, net of $9 million of acquired cash, was approximately $169 million . The purchase price included contingent consideration, payable in 2016. The contingent consideration was based on the revenues achieved by Berg in the period from January 1, 2013 to December 31, 2015 and had a fair value of approximately $7 million on the acquisition date. As of December 31, 2015, no payment is expected to be made. The transaction was financed with available cash. Tangible assets as of the acquisition date were $82 million , recorded at their fair values, and primarily included cash of $9 million , receivables of $13 million , inventories of $32 million and property, plant and equipment of $28 million . Finite-lived intangible assets acquired of $70 million included developed technology, customer relationships and trade names. The finite lived intangible assets are being amortized on a straight-line basis over a weighted-average amortization period of approximately 11 years . Liabilities assumed as of the acquisition date were $87 million , recorded at their fair values, and primarily included accounts payable of $19 million , customer advances of $31 million and net deferred tax liabilities of $15 million . Goodwill of $113 million , non-deductible for income tax purposes, represented the excess of the consideration transferred over the net assets recognized and represented the estimated future economic benefits arising from other assets acquired that could not be individually identified and separately recognized. Factors that contributed to a purchase price resulting in the recognition of goodwill include Bergs strategic fit into our product portfolio, the opportunity to provide worldwide support to marine operators for a complete, optimized propulsion package, and the acquired assembled workforce. The results of the acquired business for the period from the acquisition date are included in the accompanying consolidated financial statements and are reported in the Energy  Transportation segment. Assuming this transaction had been made at the beginning of any period presented, the consolidated pro forma results would not be materially different from reported results. ##TABLE_START 25. Divestitures ##TABLE_END  Bucyrus Distribution Business Divestitures  In conjunction with our acquisition of Bucyrus in July 2011, we announced our intention to sell the Bucyrus distribution business to Caterpillar dealers that support mining customers around the world in a series of individual transactions. Bucyrus predominantly employed a direct to end customer model to sell and support products. These transitions occurred in phases based on the mining business opportunity within each dealer territory and were substantially complete by the end of 2014.  The portions of the Bucyrus distribution business that were sold did not qualify as discontinued operations because Caterpillar has significant continuing direct cash flows from the Caterpillar dealers after the divestitures. The gain or loss on disposal, along with the continuing operations of these disposal groups, has been reported in the Resource Industries segment. Goodwill was allocated to each disposal group using the relative fair value method. The value of the customer relationship intangibles related to each portion of the Bucyrus distribution business was included in the disposal groups. The disposal groups were recorded at the lower of their carrying value or fair value less cost to sell. In 2014 and 2013, we recorded asset impairment charges of $4 million and $11 million respectively, related to disposal groups being sold to Caterpillar dealers. Fair value was determined based upon the negotiated sales price. The impairments were recorded in Other operating (income) expenses and included in the Resource Industries segment. The portions of the distribution business that were sold were not material to our results of operations, financial position or cash flow. In 2014, we completed 32 sale transactions whereby we sold portions of the Bucyrus distribution business to Caterpillar dealers for an aggregate price of $199 million . For the full year 2014, after-tax profit was unfavorably impacted by $22 million as a result of the Bucyrus distribution divestiture activities. This is comprised of $21 million of income related to sales transactions, a net unfavorable adjustment of $14 million related to prior sale transactions (both included in Other operating (income) expenses), costs incurred related to the Bucyrus distribution divestiture activities of $25 million (included in Selling, general and administrative expenses) and income tax of $4 million . Assets sold in 2014 included customer relationship intangibles of $82 million , other assets of $24 million , which consisted primarily of inventory and fixed assets, and allocated goodwill of $63 million related to the divested portions of the Bucyrus distribution business. As part of the 2014 divestitures, Cat Financial provided $20 million of financing to two of the Caterpillar dealers. In 2013, we completed 19 sale transactions whereby we sold portions of the Bucyrus distribution business to Caterpillar dealers for an aggregate price of $467 million . For the full year 2013, after-tax profit was unfavorably impacted by $39 million as a result of the Bucyrus distribution divestiture activities. This is comprised of $95 million of income related to sales transactions, a $34 million unfavorable adjustment due to a change in estimate to increase the reserve for parts returns related to prior sale transactions (both included in Other operating (income) expenses), costs incurred related to the Bucyrus distribution divestiture activities of $104 million (included in Selling, general and administrative expenses) and an income tax benefit of $4 million .  Assets sold in 2013 included customer relationship intangibles of $127 million , other assets of $65 million , which consisted primarily of inventory and fixed assets, and allocated goodwill of $56 million related to the divested portions of the Bucyrus distribution business. As part of the 2013 divestitures, Cat Financial provided $132 million of financing to five of the Caterpillar dealers. ##TABLE_START 26. Restructuring costs ##TABLE_END  Our accounting for employee separations is dependent upon how the particular program is designed. For voluntary programs, eligible separation costs are recognized at the time of employee acceptance unless the acceptance requires explicit approval by the Company. For involuntary programs, eligible costs are recognized when management has approved the program, the affected employees have been properly notified and the costs are estimable. Restructuring costs for 2015 , 2014 and 2013 were $908 million , $441 million and $200 million , respectively. The 2015 restructuring costs included $641 million of employee separation costs, $127 million of long-lived asset impairments and $92 million of defined benefit retirement plan curtailment and settlement losses and were recognized in Other operating (income) expense. In addition, in 2015 we incurred costs related to our restructuring programs of $48 million . These costs were primarily for accelerated depreciation and inventory write-downs and were recognized primarily in Cost of goods sold. The 2014 restructuring costs included $382 million of employee separation costs, $48 million of long-lived asset impairments and $11 million of defined benefit retirement plan curtailment and settlement losses. The 2013 restructuring costs included $151 million of employee separation costs, $41 million of long-lived asset impairments and $8 million of other costs. Restructuring costs for 2014 and 2013 were recognized in Other operating (income) expense. The restructuring costs in 2015 were primarily related to several restructuring programs across the company. The restructuring costs in 2014 were primarily related to a reduction in workforce at our Gosselies, Belgium, facility. The most significant charges in 2013 were for the restructuring of management and support functions and the closure or downsizing of several facilities related to our mining business. Restructuring costs are a reconciling item between Segment profit and Consolidated profit before taxes. See Note 23 for more information. The following table summarizes the 2014 and 2015 employee separation activity: ##TABLE_START (Millions of dollars) Total Liability balance at December 31, 2013 $ Increase in liability (separation charges) Reduction in liability (payments) (289 ) Liability balance at December 31, 2014 $ Increase in liability (separation charges) Reduction in liability (payments) (340 ) Liability balance at December 31, 2015 $   ##TABLE_END In December 2013, we announced a restructuring plan for our Gosselies, Belgium, facility. This restructuring plan was designed to improve the competitiveness of our European manufacturing footprint and achieve competitiveness in our European operations by refocusing our current Gosselies operations on final machine assembly, test and paint with limited component and fabrication operations. This action includes reshaping our supply base for more efficient sourcing, improving factory efficiencies and workforce reductions and was approved by the Belgian Minister of Employment in February 2014. In 2014, we recognized $273 million of these separation-related charges. In 2015, we recognized $24 million of employee separation costs relating to this restructuring plan. We do not expect any further costs associated with this program. In September 2015, we announced significant restructuring and cost reduction actions to lower our operating costs in response to current economic and business conditions. As part of that announcement, we offered a voluntary retirement enhancement program to qualifying U.S. employees, various voluntary separation programs outside of the U.S. and implemented additional involuntary separation programs throughout the company. We have eliminated approximately 5,000 positions since then, with about 3,000 employees separated by December 31, 2015 and the other 2,100 employees electing to take the voluntary retirement enhancement program in the U.S. and leave the company January 1, 2016. We incurred $379 million of employee separation costs and $86 million of defined benefit retirement plan curtailment losses related to these programs. Substantially all of the employee separation costs related to this program are included in the liability balance above and will be paid in the first quarter of 2016. The remaining liability balance as of December 31, 2015 represents costs for other employee separation programs, most of which are expected to be paid in 2016 . The remaining restructuring costs incurred during 2015 were primarily related to closure and consolidation of numerous manufacturing facilities throughout the company. ##TABLE_START 27.

Controls and Procedures. ##TABLE_END  Disclosure Controls and Procedures An evaluation was performed under the supervision and with the participation of the company's management, including the Chief Executive Officer (CEO) and Chief Financial Officer (CFO), of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the company's disclosure controls and procedures, as that term is defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Exchange Act, as of the end of the period covered by this annual report. Based on that evaluation, the CEO and CFO concluded that the company's disclosure controls and procedures are effective as of the end of the period covered by this annual report.  Managements Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting The management of Caterpillar Inc. (company) is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act. Our internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of our financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Our internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.  Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.  Management assessed the effectiveness of the companys internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2015 . In making this assessment, we used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework (2013). Based on our assessment we concluded that, as of December 31, 2015 , the companys internal control over financial reporting was effective based on those criteria. The effectiveness of the companys internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2015 has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm. Their report appears on page 68 of Part II, Item 8 \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\" Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting  During the last fiscal quarter, there has been no significant change in the companys internal control over financial reporting that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the companys internal control over financial reporting. ##TABLE_START ", "9B": " Item 9B.

Business. ##TABLE_END General  Originally organized as Caterpillar Tractor Co. in 1925 in the State of California, our company was reorganized as Caterpillar Inc. in 1986 in the State of Delaware. As used herein, the term Caterpillar, we, us, our or the company refers to Caterpillar Inc. and its subsidiaries unless designated or identified otherwise.  Overview  With 2016 sales and revenues of $38.537 billion , Caterpillar is the worlds leading manufacturer of construction and mining equipment, diesel and natural gas engines, industrial gas turbines and diesel-electric locomotives. The company principally operates through its three product segments - Construction Industries, Resource Industries and Energy  Transportation - and also provides financing and related services through its Financial Products segment. Caterpillar is also a leading U.S. exporter. Through a global network of independent dealers and direct sales of certain products, Caterpillar builds long-term relationships with customers around the world.  Currently, we have six operating segments, of which four are reportable segments and are described below. Further information about our reportable segments, including geographic information, appears in Note 23  Segment information of Part II, Item 8 \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\"  Categories of Business Organization  1.   Machinery, Energy  Transportation  Represents the aggregate total of Construction Industries, Resource Industries, Energy  Transportation and All Other operating segments and related corporate items and eliminations.  2.   Financial Products  Primarily includes the companys Financial Products Segment. This category includes Caterpillar Financial Services Corporation (Cat Financial), Caterpillar Financial Insurance Services (Insurance Services) and their respective subsidiaries.  Other information about our operations in 2016 , including certain risks associated with our operations, is included in Part II, Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.  Construction Industries  Our Construction Industries segment is primarily responsible for supporting customers using machinery in infrastructure, forestry and building construction. The majority of machine sales in this segment are made in the heavy and general construction, rental, quarry and aggregates markets and mining.  Nature of customer demand for construction machinery varies around the world. Customers in developing economies often prioritize purchase price in making their investment decisions, while customers in developed economies generally weigh productivity and other performance criteria that contribute to lower owning and operating costs over the lifetime of the machine. To meet customer expectations in developing economies, Caterpillar developed differentiated product offerings that target customers in those markets, including our SEM brand machines. We believe that these customer-driven product innovations enable us to compete more effectively in developing economies. The majority of Construction Industries' research and development spending in 2016 focused on the next generation of construction machines.  The competitive environment for construction machinery is characterized by some global competitors and many regional and specialized local competitors. Examples of global competitors include Komatsu Ltd., Volvo Construction Equipment (part of the Volvo Group), CNH Industrial N.V., Deere  Company, Hitachi Construction Machinery Co., Ltd., J.C. Bamford Excavators Ltd., Doosan Infracore Co. Ltd., and Hyundai Construction Equipment (part of Hyundai Heavy Industries). As an example of regional and local competitors, our competitors in China also include Guangxi LiuGong Machinery Co., Ltd., Longking Holdings Ltd., Sany Heavy Industry Co., Ltd., Xiamen XGMA Machinery Co., Ltd., XCMG Group, The Shandong Heavy Industry Group Co., Ltd. (Shantui Construction Machinery Co., Ltd.), Strong Construction Machinery Co., Ltd., and Shandong Lingong Construction Machinery Co., Ltd. (SDLG, part of Volvo Group). Each of these companies has varying product lines that compete with Caterpillar products, and each has varying degrees of regional focus.  The Construction Industries product portfolio includes the following machines and related parts:  ##TABLE_START    backhoe loaders    compact loaders    small track-type tractors   track-type loaders    small and medium wheel loaders   medium track-type tractors   mini excavators    small, medium and large track excavators    motorgraders   wheel excavators    pipelayers    telehandlers  cold planers   asphalt pavers    compactors   road reclaimers   wheel and track skidders   knuckleboom loaders   site prep tractors   wheel and track feller bunchers   forestry excavators   skid steer loaders     ##TABLE_ENDResource Industries  The Resource Industries segment is primarily responsible for supporting customers using machinery in mining, quarry, waste and material handling applications. Caterpillar offers mining customers the broadest product range in the industry. We manufacture high productivity equipment for both surface and underground mining operations around the world. Our equipment is used to extract and haul copper, iron ore, coal, oil sands, aggregates, gold and other minerals and ores. In addition to equipment, Resource Industries also develops and sells technology products and services to provide customers fleet management systems, equipment management analytics and autonomous machine capabilities. Customers in most markets place an emphasis on equipment that is highly productive, reliable and provides the lowest total cost of ownership over the life of the equipment. In some developing markets, customers often prioritize purchase price in making their investment decisions. We believe our ability to control the integration and design of key machine components represents a competitive advantage. Our research and development efforts remain focused on providing mining and quarry customers the lowest total cost of ownership enabled through the highest quality, most productive products in the industry. The competitive environment for Resource Industries consists of a few larger global competitors that compete in several of the markets that we serve and a substantial number of smaller companies that compete in a more limited range of products, applications, and regional markets. Our global surface competitors include Komatsu Ltd., Joy Global, Inc., Hitachi Construction Machinery Co., Ltd., Volvo Construction Equipment, Atlas Copco AB, and Sandvik Mining. Our global underground competitors include Joy Global, Inc., Atlas Copco AB, Liebherr-International AG, Sandvik Mining and Zhengzhou Coal Mining Machinery Group Co., Ltd. The Resource Industries product portfolio includes the following machines and related parts:  ##TABLE_START   electric rope shovels    large mining trucks    landfill compactors   draglines    longwall miners    soil compactors   hydraulic shovels    large wheel loaders    machinery components   track and rotary drills    off-highway trucks    electronics and control systems   highwall miners    articulated trucks    select work tools   hard rock vehicles    scoops and haulers    hard rock continuous mining systems   continuous miners    wheel tractor scrapers     large track-type tractors    wheel dozers   ##TABLE_END Energy  Transportation  Our Energy  Transportation segment supports customers in oil and gas, power generation, marine, rail and industrial applications, including Cat machines. The product and services portfolio includes reciprocating engines, generator sets, marine propulsion systems, gas turbines and turbine-related services, the remanufacturing of Cat engines and components and remanufacturing services for other companies, diesel-electric locomotives and other rail-related products and services and product support of on-highway vocational trucks for North America.  Regulatory emissions standards of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and comparable standards in other developed economies have required us to make significant investments in research and development that will continue as new products and similar regulations are introduced over the next several years. We believe that our emissions technology provides a competitive advantage in connection with emissions standards compliance and performance.  The competitive environment for reciprocating engines in marine, oil and gas, industrial and electric power generation systems along with turbines in oil and gas and electric power generation consists of a few larger global competitors that compete in a variety of markets that Caterpillar serves, and a substantial number of smaller companies that compete in a limited-size product range, geographic region and/or application. Principal global competitors include Cummins Inc., Rolls-Royce Power Systems, GE Oil  Gas, GE Power, Deutz AG and Wrtsil Corp. Other competitors, such as MAN Diesel  Turbo SE, Siemens Energy, Rolls-Royce Marine, Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Ltd., Volvo Penta, Weichai Power Co., Ltd., Kirloskar Oil Engines Limited and other emerging market competitors compete in certain markets in which Caterpillar competes. An additional set of competitors, including Generac Power Systems, Inc., Kohler Co., Inc., Aggreko plc and others, are packagers who source engines and/or other components from domestic and international suppliers and market products regionally and internationally through a variety of distribution channels. In rail-related businesses, our global competitors include GE Transportation, Vossloh AG, Siemens Akteingesellschaft, Alstom Transport SA, and Voestalpine AG. We also compete with other companies on a more limited range of products, services and/or geographic regions. The Energy  Transportation portfolio includes the following products and related parts: ##TABLE_START  reciprocating engine powered generator sets ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  reciprocating engines supplied to the industrial industry as well as Caterpillar machinery ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  integrated systems used in the electric power generation industry ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  turbines, centrifugal gas compressors and related services ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  reciprocating engines and integrated systems and solutions for the marine and oil and gas industries ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  remanufactured reciprocating engines and components ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  diesel-electric locomotives and components and other rail-related products and services ##TABLE_END Financial Products Segment  The business of our Financial Products segment is primarily conducted by Cat Financial, a wholly owned finance subsidiary of Caterpillar. Cat Financials primary business is to provide retail and wholesale financing alternatives for Caterpillar products to customers and dealers around the world. Retail financing is primarily comprised of the financing of Caterpillar equipment, machinery and engines. Cat Financial also provides financing for vehicles, power generation facilities and marine vessels that, in most cases, incorporate Caterpillar products. In addition to retail financing, Cat Financial provides wholesale financing to Caterpillar dealers and purchases short-term trade receivables from Caterpillar and its subsidiaries. The various financing plans offered by Cat Financial are primarily designed to increase the opportunity for sales of Caterpillar products and generate financing income for Cat Financial. A significant portion of Cat Financials activities is conducted in North America. Cat Financial also has offices and subsidiaries in Asia/Pacific, Europe and Latin America.  For over 35 years, Cat Financial has been providing financing in the various markets in which it participates, contributing to its knowledge of asset values, industry trends, product structuring and customer needs.  In certain instances, Cat Financials operations are subject to supervision and regulation by state, federal and various foreign governmental authorities, and may be subject to various laws and judicial and administrative decisions imposing various requirements and restrictions which, among other things, (i) regulate credit granting activities and the administration of loans, (ii) establish maximum interest rates, finance charges and other charges, (iii) require disclosures to customers and investors, (iv) govern secured transactions, (v) set collection, foreclosure, repossession and other trade practices and (vi) regulate the use and reporting of information related to a borrowers credit experience. Cat Financials ability to comply with these and other governmental and legal requirements and restrictions affects its operations. Cat Financials retail leases and installment sale contracts (totaling 55 percent*) include:  ##TABLE_START  Tax leases that are classified as either operating or finance leases for financial accounting purposes, depending on the characteristics of the lease. For tax purposes, Cat Financial is considered the owner of the equipment (14 percent*). ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  Finance (non-tax) leases, where the lessee for tax purposes is considered to be the owner of the equipment during the term of the lease, that either require or allow the customer to purchase the equipment for a fixed price at the end of the term (18 percent*). ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Installment sale contracts, which are equipment loans that enable customers to purchase equipment with a down payment or trade-in and structure payments over time (22 percent*). ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  Governmental lease-purchase plans in the U.S. that offer low interest rates and flexible terms to qualified non-federal government agencies (1 percent*). ##TABLE_END  Cat Financials wholesale notes receivable, finance leases and installment sale contracts (totaling 12 percent*) include:  ##TABLE_START  Inventory/rental programs, which provide assistance to dealers by financing their new Caterpillar inventory and rental fleets (4 percent*). ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  Short-term receivables Cat Financial purchased from Caterpillar at a discount (8 percent*). ##TABLE_END  Cat Financials retail notes receivables (33 percent*) include:  ##TABLE_START  Loans that allow customers and dealers to use their Caterpillar equipment or other assets as collateral to obtain financing. ##TABLE_END *Indicates the percentage of Cat Financials total portfolio at December 31, 2016. We define total portfolio as total finance receivables (net of unearned income and allowance for credit losses) plus equipment on operating leases, less accumulated depreciation. For more information on the above and Cat Financials concentration of credit risk, please refer to Note 6  Cat Financial Financing Activities of Part II, Item 8 \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\" _____________________________  Cat Financial operates in a highly competitive environment, with financing for users of Caterpillar equipment available through a variety of sources, principally commercial banks and finance and leasing companies. Cat Financials competitors include Wells Fargo Equipment Finance Inc. and various other banks and finance companies. In addition, many of our manufacturing competitors own financial subsidiaries such as Volvo Financial Services, Komatsu Financial L.P. and John Deere Capital Corporation that utilize below-market interest rate programs (funded by the manufacturer) to assist machine sales. Caterpillar and Cat Financial work together to provide a broad array of financial merchandising programs around the world to meet these competitive offers.  Cat Financials financial results are largely dependent upon the ability of Caterpillar dealers to sell equipment and customers willingness to enter into financing or leasing agreements. It is also affected by, among other things, the availability of funds from its financing sources, general economic conditions such as inflation and market interest rates and its cost of funds relative to its competitors.  Cat Financial has a match-funding policy that addresses interest rate risk by aligning the interest rate profile (fixed or floating rate) of its debt portfolio with the interest rate profile of its receivables portfolio within predetermined ranges on an ongoing basis. In connection with that policy, Cat Financial uses interest rate derivative instruments to modify the debt structure to match assets within the receivables portfolio. This matched funding reduces the volatility of margins between interest-bearing assets and interest-bearing liabilities, regardless of which direction interest rates move. For more information regarding match funding, please see Note 3  Derivative financial instruments and risk management of Part II, Item 8 \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\" See also the risk factors associated with our financial products business included in Item 1 A. of this Form 10-K. In managing foreign currency risk for Cat Financials operations, the objective is to minimize earnings volatility resulting from conversion and the remeasurement of net foreign currency balance sheet positions, and future transactions denominated in foreign currencies. This policy allows the use of foreign currency forward, option and cross currency contracts to offset the risk of currency mismatch between the receivable and debt portfolios, and exchange rate risk associated with future transactions denominated in foreign currencies.  Cat Financial provides financing only when certain criteria are met. Credit decisions are based on a variety of credit quality factors including prior payment experience, customer financial information, credit-rating agency ratings, loan-to-value ratios and other internal metrics. Cat Financial typically maintains a security interest in retail-financed equipment and requires physical damage insurance coverage on financed equipment. Cat Financial finances a significant portion of Caterpillar dealers sales and inventory of Caterpillar equipment throughout the world. Cat Financials competitive position is improved by marketing programs offered in conjunction with Caterpillar and/or Caterpillar dealers. Under these programs, Caterpillar, or the dealer, funds an amount at the outset of the transaction, which Cat Financial then recognizes as revenue over the term of the financing. We believe that these marketing programs provide Cat Financial a significant competitive advantage in financing Caterpillar products.

In all markets, we compete on the basis of product performance, customer service, quality and price. From time to time, the intensity of competition results in price discounting in a particular industry or region. Such price discounting puts pressure on margins and can negatively impact operating profit. Outside the United States, certain of our competitors enjoy competitive advantages inherent to operating in their home countries or regions.  Raw Materials and Component Products  We source our raw materials and manufactured components from suppliers both domestically and internationally. These purchases include unformed materials and rough and finished parts. Unformed materials include a variety of steel products, which are then cut or formed to shape and machined in our facilities. Rough parts include various sized steel and iron castings and forgings, which are machined to final specification levels inside our facilities. Finished parts are ready to assemble components, which are made either to Caterpillar specifications or to supplier developed specifications. We machine and assemble some of the components used in our machines, engines and power generation units and to support our after-market dealer parts sales. We also purchase various goods and services used in production, logistics, offices and product development processes. We maintain global strategic sourcing models to meet our global facilities production needs while building long-term supplier relationships and leveraging enterprise spend. We expect our suppliers to maintain, at all times, industry-leading levels of quality and the ability to timely deliver raw materials and component products for our machine and engine products. We use a variety of agreements with suppliers to protect our intellectual property and processes to monitor and mitigate risks of the supply base causing a business disruption. The risks monitored include supplier financial viability, the ability to increase or decrease production levels, business continuity, quality and delivery.  Patents and Trademarks  We own a number of patents and trademarks, which have been obtained over a period of years and relate to the products we manufacture and the services we provide. These patents and trademarks are generally considered beneficial to our business. We do not regard our business as being dependent upon any single patent or group of patents. Order Backlog  The dollar amount of backlog believed to be firm was approximately $12.1 billion at December 31, 2016 and $13.0 billion at December 31, 2015 . Compared with year-end 2015 , the order backlog declined about $900 million. The decrease was in Energy  Transportation and Construction Industries, partially offset by an increase in Resource Industries. Of the total backlog at December 31, 2016 , approximately $3.4 billion was not expected to be filled in 2017 . Dealers and Distributors  Our machines are distributed principally through a worldwide organization of dealers (dealer network), 49 located in the United States and 123 located outside the United States, serving 190 countries. Reciprocating engines are sold principally through the dealer network and to other manufacturers for use in products. Some of the reciprocating engines manufactured by our subsidiary Perkins Engines Company Limited, are also sold through its worldwide network of 96 distributors covering 179 countries. The FG Wilson branded electric power generation systems manufactured by our subsidiary Caterpillar Northern Ireland Limited are sold through its worldwide network of 184 distributors covering 145 countries. Some of the large, medium speed reciprocating engines are also sold under the MaK brand through a worldwide network of 20 distributors covering 130 countries.  Our dealers do not deal exclusively with our products; however, in most cases sales and servicing of our products are the dealers principal business. Some products, primarily turbines and locomotives, are sold directly to end customers through sales forces employed by the company. At times, these employees are assisted by independent sales representatives. While the large majority of our worldwide dealers are independently owned and operated, we own and operate a dealership in Japan that covers approximately 85% of the Japanese market: Nippon Caterpillar Division. We are currently operating this Japanese dealer directly and its results are reported in the All Other operating segments. There are also three independent dealers in the Southern Region of Japan.  For Caterpillar branded products, the companys relationship with each of its independent dealers is memorialized in standard sales and service agreements. Pursuant to this agreement, the company grants the dealer the right to purchase and sell its products and to service the products in a specified geographic service territory. Prices to dealers are established by the company after receiving input from dealers on transactional pricing in the marketplace. The company also agrees to defend its intellectual property and to provide warranty and technical support to the dealer. The agreement further grants the dealer a non-exclusive license to use the companys trademarks, service marks and brand names. In some instances, a separate trademark agreement exists between the company and a dealer.  In exchange for these rights, the agreement obligates the dealer to develop and promote the sale of the companys products to current and prospective customers in the dealers service territory. Each dealer agrees to employ adequate sales and support personnel to market, sell and promote the companys products, demonstrate and exhibit the products, perform the companys product improvement programs, inform the company concerning any features that might affect the safe operation of any of the companys products and maintain detailed books and records of the dealers financial condition, sales and inventories and make these books and records available at the companys reasonable request.  These sales and service agreements are terminable at will by either party primarily upon 90 days written notice.  Research and Development  We place strong emphasis on product-oriented research and development relating to the development of new or improved machines, engines and major components. In 2016 , 2015 and 2014 , we spent $1,951 million, $2,119 million and $2,380 million, or 5.1, 4.5 and 4.3 percent of our sales and revenues, respectively, on our research and development programs.  Employment  As of December 31, 2016 , we employed about 95,400 full-time persons of whom approximately 54,500 were located outside the United States. In the United States, we employed approximately 40,900 employees, most of whom are at-will employees and, therefore, not subject to any type of employment contract or agreement. Full-time employment at the end of 2015 includes approximately 2,100 employees who participated in the U.S. voluntary retirement enhancement program in the U.S. and left the company January 1, 2016. At select business units, certain highly specialized employees have been hired under employment contracts that specify a term of employment, pay and other benefits.  ##TABLE_START Full-Time Employees at Year-End      Inside U.S. 40,900  47,700 Outside U.S. 54,500  58,000 Total 95,400  105,700     By Region:    North America 41,200  48,000 EAME 20,000  21,300 Latin America 11,400  12,300 Asia/Pacific 22,800  24,100 Total 95,400  105,700     ##TABLE_ENDAs of December 31, 2016 , there were approximately 7,400 U.S. hourly production employees who were covered by collective bargaining agreements with various labor unions, including The United Automobile, Aerospace and Agricultural Implement Workers of America (UAW), The International Association of Machinists and The United Steelworkers. Approximately 5,600 of such employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements with the UAW that expire on March 1, 2017 and December 17, 2018. Outside the United States, the company enters into employment contracts and agreements in those countries in which such relationships are mandatory or customary. The provisions of these agreements generally correspond in each case with the required or customary terms in the subject jurisdiction.  Sales and Revenues  Sales and revenues outside the United States were 59 percent of consolidated sales and revenues for 2016 and 2015 and 62 percent for 2014 . Environmental Matters  The company is regulated by federal, state and international environmental laws governing our use, transport and disposal of substances and control of emissions. In addition to governing our manufacturing and other operations, these laws often impact the development of our products, including, but not limited to, required compliance with air emissions standards applicable to internal combustion engines. We have made, and will continue to make, significant research and development and capital expenditures to comply with these emissions standards.  We are engaged in remedial activities at a number of locations, often with other companies, pursuant to federal and state laws. When it is probable we will pay remedial costs at a site, and those costs can be reasonably estimated, the investigation, remediation, and operating and maintenance costs are accrued against our earnings. Costs are accrued based on consideration of currently available data and information with respect to each individual site, including available technologies, current applicable laws and regulations, and prior remediation experience. Where no amount within a range of estimates is more likely, we accrue the minimum. Where multiple potentially responsible parties are involved, we consider our proportionate share of the probable costs. In formulating the estimate of probable costs, we do not consider amounts expected to be recovered from insurance companies or others. We reassess these accrued amounts on a quarterly basis. The amount recorded for environmental remediation is not material and is included in the line item \"Accrued expenses\" in Statement 3  \"Consolidated Financial Position at December 31\" of Part II, Item 8 \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\" There is no more than a remote chance that a material amount for remedial activities at any individual site, or at all the sites in the aggregate, will be required.

You should, however, consult any subsequent disclosures we make in our filings with the SEC on Form 10-Q or Form 8-K.  The following is a cautionary discussion of risks, uncertainties and assumptions that we believe are significant to our business. In addition to the factors discussed elsewhere in this report, the following are some of the important factors that, individually or in the aggregate, we believe could make our actual results differ materially from those described in any forward-looking statements. It is impossible to predict or identify all such factors and, as a result, you should not consider the following factors to be a complete discussion of risks, uncertainties and assumptions. MACROECONOMIC RISKS Our business is highly sensitive to global and regional economic conditions and economic conditions in the industries we serve.  Our results of operations are materially affected by economic conditions globally and regionally and in the particular industries we serve. The demand for our products and services tends to be cyclical and can be significantly reduced in periods of economic weakness characterized by lower levels of government and business investment, lower levels of business confidence, lower corporate earnings, perceived or actual industry overcapacity, higher unemployment and lower consumer spending. A prolonged period of economic weakness may also result in increased expenses due to higher allowances for doubtful accounts and potential goodwill and asset impairment charges. Economic conditions vary across regions and countries, and demand for our products and services generally increases in those regions and countries experiencing economic growth and investment. Slower economic growth or a change in the global mix of regions and countries experiencing economic growth and investment could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.  The energy, transportation and mining industries are major users of our products, including the coal, iron ore, gold, copper, oil and natural gas industries. Customers in these industries frequently base their decisions to purchase our products on the expected future performance of these industries, which in turn are dependent in part on commodity prices. Prices of commodities in these industries are frequently volatile and can change abruptly and unpredictibly in response to general economic conditions and trends, government actions, regulatory actions, commodity inventories, production levels, market expectations and any disruptions in production or distribution. Economic conditions affecting the industries we serve may in the future also lead to reduced capital expenditures by our customers. Reduced capital expenditures by our customers are likely to lead to a decrease in the demand for our products and may also result in a decrease in demand for aftermarket parts as customers are likely to extend preventative maintenance schedules and delay major overhauls when possible.  The rates of infrastructure spending, housing starts and commercial construction also play a significant role in our results. Our products are an integral component of these activities, and as these activities decrease, demand for our products may be significantly impacted, which could negatively impact our results. Commodity price changes, material price increases, fluctuations in demand for our products or significant shortages of material may adversely impact our financial results or our ability to meet commitments to customers.  We are a significant user of steel and many other commodities required for the manufacture of our products. Increases in the prices of such commodities would increase our costs, negatively impacting our business, results of operations and financial condition if we are unable to fully offset the effect of these increased costs through price increases, productivity improvements or cost reduction programs.  We rely on suppliers to secure material, particularly steel, required for the manufacture of our products. A disruption in deliveries to or from suppliers or decreased availability of raw materials or commodities could have an adverse effect on our ability to meet our commitments to customers or increase our operating costs. On the other hand, if demand for our products is less than we expect, we may experience excess inventories and be forced to incur additional charges and our profitability may suffer. Our business, competitive position, results of operations or financial condition could be negatively impacted if supply is insufficient for our operations, if we experience excess inventories or if we are unable to adjust our production schedules or our purchases from suppliers to reflect changes in customer demand and market fluctuations on a timely basis. Changes in government monetary or fiscal policies may negatively impact our results .  Most countries where our products and services are sold have established central banks to regulate monetary systems and influence economic activities, generally by adjusting interest rates. Interest rate changes affect overall economic growth, which affects demand for residential and nonresidential structures, as well as energy and mined products, which in turn affects sales of our products and services that serve these activities. Interest rate changes may also affect our customers ability to finance machine purchases, can change the optimal time to keep machines in a fleet and can impact the ability of our suppliers to finance the production of parts and components necessary to manufacture and support our products. Increases in interest rates could negatively impact sales and create supply chain inefficiencies.  Central banks and other policy arms of many countries take actions to vary the amount of liquidity and credit available in an economy. The impact from a change in liquidity and credit policies could impact the customers and markets we serve or our suppliers, which could adversely impact our business, results of operations and financial condition. Changes in monetary and fiscal policies, along with other factors, may cause currency exchange rates to fluctuate. Actions that lead the currency exchange rate of a country where we manufacture products to increase relative to other currencies could reduce the competitiveness of products made in that country, which could adversely affect our competitive position, results of operations and financial condition. Government policies on taxes and spending also affect our business. Throughout the world, government spending finances a significant portion of infrastructure development, such as highways, airports, sewer and water systems and dams. Tax regulations determine depreciation lives and the amount of money users of our products can retain, both of which influence investment decisions. Unfavorable developments, such as declines in government revenues, decisions to reduce public spending or increases in taxes, could negatively impact our results. Our global operations are exposed to political and economic risks, commercial instability and events beyond our control in the countries in which we operate.  Our global operations are dependent upon products manufactured, purchased and sold in the U.S. and internationally, including in countries with political and economic instability or uncertainty. This includes, for example, the uncertainty related to the United Kingdoms June 2016 vote to leave the European Union (commonly known as Brexit).  Some countries have greater political and economic volatility and greater vulnerability to infrastructure and labor disruptions than others. Our business could be negatively impacted by adverse fluctuations in freight costs, limitations on shipping and receiving capacity, and other disruptions in the transportation and shipping infrastructure at important geographic points of exit and entry for our products. Operating in a number of different regions and countries exposes us to a number of risks, including: ##TABLE_START  multiple and potentially conflicting laws, regulations and policies that are subject to change; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  imposition of currency restrictions, restrictions on repatriation of earnings or other restraints; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  imposition of burdensome tariffs or quotas; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  changes in trade agreements; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  imposition of new or additional trade and economic sanctions laws imposed by the U.S. or foreign governments; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  war or terrorist acts; and ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  political and economic instability or civil unrest that may severely disrupt economic activity in affected countries. ##TABLE_END The occurrence of one or more of these events may negatively impact our business, results of operations and financial condition.  OPERATIONAL RISKS The success of our business depends on our ability to develop, produce and market quality products that meet our customers needs.  Our business relies on continued global demand for our brands and products. To achieve business goals, we must develop and sell products that appeal to our dealers, OEMs and end-user customers. This is dependent on a number of factors, including our ability to maintain key dealer relationships, our ability to produce products that meet the quality, performance and price expectations of our customers and our ability to develop effective sales, advertising and marketing programs. In addition, our continued success in selling products that appeal to our customers is dependent on leading-edge innovation, with respect to both products and operations, and on the availability and effectiveness of legal protection for our innovation. Failure to continue to deliver high quality, innovative, competitive products to the marketplace, to adequately protect our intellectual property rights, to supply products that meet applicable regulatory requirements, including engine exhaust emission requirements or to predict market demands for, or gain market acceptance of, our products, could have a negative impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition. We operate in a highly competitive environment, which could adversely affect our sales and pricing.  We operate in a highly competitive environment. We compete on the basis of a variety of factors, including product performance, customer service, quality and price. There can be no assurance that our products will be able to compete successfully with other companies products. Thus, our share of industry sales could be reduced due to aggressive pricing or product strategies pursued by competitors, unanticipated product or manufacturing difficulties, our failure to price our products competitively, our failure to produce our products at a competitive cost or an unexpected buildup in competitors new machine or dealer-owned rental fleets, leading to severe downward pressure on machine rental rates and/or used equipment prices.  Lack of customer acceptance of price increases we announce from time to time, changes in customer requirements for price discounts, changes in our customers behavior or a weak pricing environment attributable to industry overcapacity could have an adverse impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition.  In addition, our results and ability to compete may be impacted negatively by changes in our geographic and product mix of sales. Increased information technology security threats and more sophisticated computer crime pose a risk to our systems, networks, products and services. We rely upon information technology systems and networks, some of which are managed by third parties, in connection with a variety of business activities. Additionally, we collect and store data that is sensitive to Caterpillar. Operating these information technology systems and networks and processing and maintaining this data, in a secure manner, are critical to our business operations and strategy. Information technology security threats -- from user error to cybersecurity attacks designed to gain unauthorized access to our systems, networks and data -- are increasing in frequency and sophistication. Cybersecurity attacks may range from random attempts to coordinated and targeted attacks, including sophisticated computer crime and advanced threats. These threats pose a risk to the security of our systems and networks and the confidentiality, availability and integrity of our data. Cybersecurity attacks could also include attacks targeting the security, integrity and/or reliability of the hardware and software installed in our products. We have experienced cybersecurity attacks that have resulted in unauthorized parties gaining access to our information technology systems and networks, and we could in the future experience similar attacks. However, to date, no cybersecurity attack has had a material impact on our financial condition, results of operations or liquidity. While we actively manage information technology security risks within our control, there can be no assurance that such actions will be sufficient to mitigate all potential risks to our systems, networks and data. The potential consequences of a material cybersecurity attack include reputational damage, litigation with third parties, disruption to systems, unauthorized release of confidential or otherwise protected information, corruption of data, diminution in the value of our investment in research, development and engineering, and increased cybersecurity protection and remediation costs, which in turn could adversely affect our competitiveness and results of operations. We expect to incur additional restructuring charges as we continue to contemplate cost reduction actions in an effort to optimize our cost structure and may not achieve the anticipated savings and benefits of these actions. On September 24, 2015, we announced significant restructuring and cost reduction actions expected to occur through 2018 to lower our operating costs in response to current economic and business conditions. We expect to take additional restructuring actions to optimize our cost structure and improve the efficiency of our operation, which will reduce our profitability in the periods incurred. As a result of these actions, we will incur charges, which may include but not be limited to asset impairments, employee termination costs, charges for pension and other postretirement contractual benefits, potential additional pension funding obligations, and pension curtailments, any of which could be significant, and could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. In addition, we may not realize anticipated savings or benefits from past or future cost reduction actions in full or in part or within the time periods we expect. We are also subject to the risks of labor unrest, negative publicity and business disruption in connection with our cost reduction actions. Failure to realize anticipated savings or benefits from our cost reduction actions could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition, liquidity, results of operations and cash flows. We may not realize all of the anticipated benefits from cost-reduction initiatives, cash flow improvement initiatives and efficiency or productivity initiatives. We are actively engaged in a number of initiatives to increase our productivity, efficiency and cash flow and to reduce costs, which we expect to have a positive long-term effect on our business, competitive position, results of operations and financial condition. For example, one such initiative is to implement sustained improvements in our operational efficiency and order-to-delivery processes so that our lead time is better aligned with customer requirements, as well as to reduce waste, further enhance quality and maximize value for our customers. There can be no assurance that these initiatives or others will continue to be beneficial to the extent anticipated, or that the estimated efficiency improvements, incremental cost savings or cash flow improvements will be realized as anticipated or at all. If these initiatives are not implemented successfully, it could have an adverse effect on our operations and competitive position. Our business is subject to the inventory management decisions and sourcing practices of our dealers and our OEM customers.  We sell finished products primarily through an independent dealer network and directly to OEMs and are subject to risks relating to their inventory management decisions and operational and sourcing practices. Both carry inventories of finished products as part of ongoing operations and adjust those inventories based on their assessments of future needs and market conditions, including levels of used equipment inventory. Such adjustments may impact our results positively or negatively. If the inventory levels of our dealers and OEM customers are higher than they desire, they may postpone product purchases from us, which could cause our sales to be lower than the end-user demand for our products and negatively impact our results. Similarly, our results could be negatively impacted through the loss of time-sensitive sales if our dealers and OEM customers do not maintain inventory levels sufficient to meet customer demand. We may not realize all of the anticipated benefits of our acquisitions, joint ventures or divestitures, or these benefits may take longer to realize than expected. In pursuing our business strategy, we routinely evaluate targets and enter into agreements regarding possible acquisitions, divestitures and joint ventures. We often compete with others for the same opportunities. To be successful, we conduct due diligence to identify valuation issues and potential loss contingencies, negotiate transaction terms, complete complex transactions and manage post-closing matters such as the integration of acquired businesses. Further, while we seek to mitigate risks and liabilities of such transactions through, among other things, due diligence, there may be risks and liabilities that such due diligence efforts fail to discover, that are not accurately or completely disclosed to us or that we inadequately assess. We may incur unanticipated costs or expenses following a completed acquisition, including post-closing asset impairment charges, expenses associated with eliminating duplicate facilities, litigation, and other liabilities. Risks associated with our past or future acquisitions also include the following: ##TABLE_START  the business culture of the acquired business may not match well with our culture; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  technological and product synergies, economies of scale and cost reductions may not occur as expected; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  unforeseen expenses, delays or conditions may be imposed upon the acquisition, including due to required regulatory approvals or consents; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  we may acquire or assume unexpected liabilities or be subject to unexpected penalties or other enforcement actions; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  faulty assumptions may be made regarding the macroeconomic environment or the integration process; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  unforeseen difficulties may arise in integrating operations, processes and systems; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  higher than expected investments may be required to implement necessary compliance processes and related systems, including IT systems, accounting systems and internal controls over financial reporting; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  we may fail to retain, motivate and integrate key management and other employees of the acquired business; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  higher than expected costs may arise due to unforeseen changes in tax, trade, environmental, labor, safety, payroll or pension policies in any jurisdiction in which the acquired business conducts its operations; and ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  we may experience problems in retaining customers and integrating customer bases. ##TABLE_END Many of these factors will be outside of our control and any one of them could result in increased costs, decreases in the amount of expected revenues and diversion of managements time and attention. They may also delay the realization of the benefits we anticipate when we enter into a transaction.  In order to conserve cash for operations, we may undertake acquisitions financed in part through public offerings or private placements of debt or equity securities, or other arrangements. Such acquisition financing could result in a decrease in our earnings and adversely affect other leverage measures. If we issue equity securities or equity-linked securities, the issued securities may have a dilutive effect on the interests of the holders of our common shares.  Failure to implement our acquisition strategy, including successfully integrating acquired businesses, could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Furthermore, we make strategic divestitures from time to time. In the case of divestitures, we may agree to indemnify acquiring parties for certain liabilities arising from our former businesses. These divestitures may also result in continued financial involvement in the divested businesses, including through guarantees or other financial arrangements, following the transaction. Lower performance by those divested businesses could affect our future financial results. Union disputes or other labor matters could adversely affect our operations and financial results.  Some of our employees are represented by labor unions in a number of countries under various collective bargaining agreements with varying durations and expiration dates. There can be no assurance that any current or future issues with our employees will be resolved or that we will not encounter future strikes, work stoppages or other types of conflicts with labor unions or our employees. We may not be able to satisfactorily renegotiate collective bargaining agreements in the United States and other countries when they expire. If we fail to renegotiate our existing collective bargaining agreements, we could encounter strikes or work stoppages or other types of conflicts with labor unions. In addition, existing collective bargaining agreements may not prevent a strike or work stoppage at our facilities in the future. We may also be subject to general country strikes or work stoppages unrelated to our business or collective bargaining agreements. A work stoppage or other limitations on production at our facilities for any reason could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. In addition, many of our customers and suppliers have unionized work forces. Strikes or work stoppages experienced by our customers or suppliers could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Unexpected events, including natural disasters, may increase our cost of doing business or disrupt our operations.  The occurrence of one or more unexpected events, including war, terrorist acts, fires, tornadoes, tsunamis, hurricanes, earthquakes, floods and other forms of severe weather in the United States or in other countries in which we operate or in which our suppliers are located could adversely affect our operations and financial performance. Natural disasters, pandemic illness, equipment failures, power outages or other unexpected events could result in physical damage to and complete or partial closure of one or more of our manufacturing facilities or distribution centers, temporary or long-term disruption in the supply of component products from some local and international suppliers, disruption in the transport of our products to dealers and end-users and delay in the delivery of our products to our distribution centers. Existing insurance arrangements may not provide protection for all of the costs that may arise from such events. FINANCIAL RISKS Disruptions or volatility in global financial markets could limit our sources of liquidity, or the liquidity of our customers, dealers and suppliers.  Continuing to meet our cash requirements over the long-term requires substantial liquidity and access to varied sources of funds, including capital and credit markets. Global economic conditions may cause volatility and disruptions in the capital and credit markets. Market volatility, changes in counterparty credit risk, the impact of government intervention in financial markets and general economic conditions may also adversely impact our ability to access capital and credit markets to fund operating needs. Global or regional economic downturns could cause financial markets to decrease the availability of liquidity, credit and credit capacity for certain issuers, including certain of our customers, dealers and suppliers. An inability to access capital and credit markets may have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and competitive position. Furthermore, changes in global economic conditions, including material cost increases and decreases in economic activity in key markets we serve, and the success of plans to manage cost increases, inventory and other important elements of our business may significantly impact our ability to generate funds from operations.  In addition, demand for our products generally depends on customers ability to pay for our products, which, in turn, depends on their access to funds. Changes in global economic conditions may result in customers experiencing increased difficulty in generating funds from operations and capital and credit market volatility and uncertainty may cause financial institutions to revise their lending standards, resulting in customers decreased access to capital. If capital and credit market volatility occurs, customers liquidity may decline which, in turn, would reduce their ability to purchase our products. Failure to maintain our credit ratings would increase our cost of borrowing and could adversely affect our cost of funds, liquidity, competitive position and access to capital markets.  Each of Caterpillars and Cat Financials costs of borrowing and their respective ability to access the capital markets are affected not only by market conditions but also by the short- and long-term debt ratings assigned to their respective debt by the major credit rating agencies. These ratings are based, in significant part, on each of Caterpillars and Cat Financials performance as measured by financial metrics such as net worth, interest coverage and leverage ratios, as well as transparency with rating agencies and timeliness of financial reporting. There can be no assurance that Caterpillar or Cat Financial will be able to maintain their credit ratings. On December 13, 2016, Moodys Investors Service (Moodys) downgraded the long- and short-term ratings of Caterpillar and Cat Financial to A3 from A2 and to Prime-2 from Prime-1. A further downgrade of Caterpillar or Cat Financials credit ratings by Moodys or one of the other major credit rating agencies could adversely affect Caterpillars and Cat Financials cost of funds, liquidity, competitive position and access to the capital markets, including restricting, in whole or in part, access to the commercial paper market. There can be no assurance that the commercial paper market will continue to be a reliable source of short-term financing for Cat Financial or an available source of short-term financing for Caterpillar. An inability to access the capital markets could have an adverse effect on our cash flow, results of operations and financial condition.  Our Financial Products segment is subject to risks associated with the financial services industry.  Cat Financial is significant to our operations and provides financing support to a significant share of our global sales. The inability of Cat Financial to access funds to support its financing activities to our customers could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Continuing to meet Cat Financial's cash requirements over the long-term could require substantial liquidity and access to sources of funds, including capital and credit markets. Cat Financial has continued to maintain access to key global medium term note and commercial paper markets, but there can be no assurance that such markets will continue to represent a reliable source of financing. If global economic conditions were to deteriorate, Cat Financial could face materially higher financing costs, become unable to access adequate funding to operate and grow its business and/or meet its debt service obligations as they mature, and be required to draw upon contractually committed lending agreements and/or seek other funding sources. However, there can be no assurance that such agreements and other funding sources would be available or sufficient under extreme market conditions. Any of these events could negatively impact Cat Financials business, as well as our and Cat Financial's results of operations and financial condition.  Market disruption and volatility may also lead to a number of other risks in connection with these events, including but not limited to: ##TABLE_START  Market developments that may affect customer confidence levels and cause declines in the demand for financing and adverse changes in payment patterns, causing increases in delinquencies and default rates, which could impact Cat Financials write-offs and provision for credit losses. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  The process Cat Financial uses to estimate losses inherent in its credit exposure requires a high degree of managements judgment regarding numerous subjective qualitative factors, including forecasts of economic conditions and how economic predictors might impair the ability of its borrowers to repay their loans. Financial market disruption and volatility may impact the accuracy of these judgments. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  Cat Financials ability to engage in routine funding transactions or borrow from other financial institutions on acceptable terms or at all could be adversely affected by disruptions in the capital markets or other events, including actions by rating agencies and deteriorating investor expectations. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  As Cat Financials lending agreements are primarily with financial institutions, their ability to perform in accordance with any of its underlying agreements could be adversely affected by market volatility and/or disruptions in financial markets. ##TABLE_END Changes in interest rates or market liquidity conditions could adversely affect Cat Financial's and our earnings and/or cash flow.  Changes in interest rates and market liquidity conditions could have an adverse effect on Cat Financial's and our earnings and cash flows. Because a significant number of the loans made by Cat Financial are made at fixed interest rates, its business is subject to fluctuations in interest rates. Changes in market interest rates may influence its financing costs, returns on financial investments and the valuation of derivative contracts and could reduce its and our earnings and cash flows. Although Cat Financial manages interest rate and market liquidity risks through a variety of techniques, including a match funding program, the selective use of derivatives and a broadly diversified funding program, there can be no assurance that fluctuations in interest rates and market liquidity conditions will not have an adverse effect on its and our earnings and cash flows. If any of the variety of instruments and strategies Cat Financial uses to hedge its exposure to these types of risk is ineffective, we may incur losses. With respect to Insurance Services' investment activities, changes in the equity and bond markets could cause an impairment of the value of its investment portfolio, requiring a negative adjustment to earnings. An increase in delinquencies, repossessions or net losses of Cat Financial customers could adversely affect its results.  Inherent in the operation of Cat Financial is the credit risk associated with its customers. The creditworthiness of each customer and the rate of delinquencies, repossessions and net losses on customer obligations are directly impacted by several factors, including relevant industry and economic conditions, the availability of capital, the experience and expertise of the customer's management team, commodity prices, political events and the sustained value of the underlying collateral. Any increase in delinquencies, repossessions and net losses on customer obligations could have a material adverse effect on Cat Financial's and our earnings and cash flows. In addition, although Cat Financial evaluates and adjusts its allowance for credit losses related to past due and non-performing receivables on a regular basis, adverse economic conditions or other factors that might cause deterioration of the financial health of its customers could change the timing and level of payments received and thus necessitate an increase in Cat Financial's estimated losses, which could also have a material adverse effect on Cat Financial's and our earnings and cash flows. Currency exchange rate fluctuations affect our results of operations, as reported in our financial statements.  We conduct operations in many areas of the world, involving transactions denominated in a variety of currencies. We are subject to currency exchange rate risk to the extent that our costs are denominated in currencies other than those in which we earn revenues. Fluctuations in currency exchange rates have had, and will continue to have, an impact on our results as expressed in U.S. dollars. There can be no assurance that currency exchange rate fluctuations will not adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. While the use of currency hedging instruments may provide us with protection from adverse fluctuations in currency exchange rates, by utilizing these instruments we potentially forego the benefits that might result from favorable fluctuations in currency exchange rates. In addition, our outlooks do not assume fluctuations in currency exchange rates. Adverse fluctuations in currency exchange rates from the date of our outlooks could cause our actual results to differ materially from those anticipated in our outlooks and adversely impact our business, results of operations and financial condition.  We also face risks arising from the imposition of exchange controls and currency devaluations. Exchange controls may limit our ability to convert foreign currencies into U.S. dollars or to remit dividends and other payments by our foreign subsidiaries or businesses located in or conducted within a country imposing controls. Currency devaluations result in a diminished value of funds denominated in the currency of the country instituting the devaluation.  Restrictive covenants in our debt agreements could limit our financial and operating flexibility.  We maintain a number of credit facilities to support general corporate purposes (facilities) and have issued debt securities to manage liquidity and fund operations (debt securities). The agreements relating to a number of the facilities and the debt securities contain certain restrictive covenants applicable to us and certain of our subsidiaries, including Cat Financial. These covenants include maintaining a minimum consolidated net worth (defined as the consolidated stockholders equity including preferred stock but excluding the pension and other post-retirement benefits balance within accumulated other comprehensive income (loss)), limitations on the incurrence of liens and certain restrictions on consolidation and merger. Cat Financial has also agreed under certain of these agreements not to exceed a certain leverage ratio (consolidated debt to consolidated net worth, calculated (1) on a monthly basis as the average of the leverage ratios determined on the last day of each of the six preceding calendar months and (2) at each December 31), to maintain a minimum interest coverage ratio (profit excluding income taxes, interest expense and net gain/(loss) from interest rate derivatives to interest expense, calculated at the end of each calendar quarter for the rolling four quarter period then most recently ended) and not to terminate, amend or modify its support agreement with us.  A breach of one or more of the covenants could result in adverse consequences that could negatively impact our business, results of operations and financial condition. These consequences may include the acceleration of amounts outstanding under certain of the facilities, triggering of an obligation to redeem certain debt securities, termination of existing unused commitments by our lenders, refusal by our lenders to extend further credit under one or more of the facilities or to enter into new facilities or the lowering or modification of our credit ratings or those of one or more of our subsidiaries.  Sustained increases in funding obligations under our pension plans may impair our liquidity or financial condition.  We maintain certain defined benefit pension plans for our employees, which impose on us certain funding obligations. In determining our future payment obligations under the plans, we assume certain rates of return on the plan assets and a certain level of future benefit payments. Significant adverse changes in credit or capital markets could result in actual rates of return being materially lower than projected and increased contribution requirements. We are expecting to make contributions to our pension plans in the future, and may be required to make contributions that could be material. We may fund contributions through the use of cash on hand, the proceeds of borrowings, shares of our common stock or a combination of the foregoing, as permitted by applicable law. Our assumptions for future benefit payments may also be materially higher than projected. These factors could significantly increase our payment obligations under the plans, and as a result, adversely affect our business and overall financial condition. LEGAL  REGULATORY RISKS Our global operations are subject to extensive trade and anti-corruption laws and regulations.  Due to the international scope of our operations, we are subject to a complex system of import- and export-related laws and regulations, including U.S. regulations issued by Customs and Border Protection, the Bureau of Industry and Security, the Office of Antiboycott Compliance, the Directorate of Defense Trade Controls and the Office of Foreign Assets Control, as well as the counterparts of these agencies in other countries. Any alleged or actual violations may subject us to government scrutiny, investigation and civil and criminal penalties, and may limit our ability to import or export our products or to provide services outside the United States. Furthermore, embargoes and sanctions imposed by the U.S. and other governments restricting or prohibiting sales to specific persons or countries or based on product classification expose us to potential criminal and civil sanctions. We cannot predict the nature, scope or effect of future regulatory requirements to which our operations might be subject or the manner in which existing laws might be administered or interpreted.  In addition, the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and similar foreign anti-corruption laws generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments or providing anything of value to improperly influence foreign government officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business, or obtaining an unfair advantage. Recent years have seen a substantial increase in the global enforcement of anti-corruption laws. Our operations outside the United States, including in developing countries, could increase the risk of such violations. Violations of anti-corruption laws or regulations by our employees, by intermediaries acting on our behalf, or by our joint venture partners may result in severe criminal or civil sanctions, could disrupt our business, and result in an adverse effect on our reputation, business and results of operations or financial condition. International trade policies may impact demand for our products and our competitive position.  Government policies on international trade and investment such as import quotas, capital controls or tariffs, whether adopted by individual governments or addressed by regional trade blocs, can affect the demand for our products and services, impact the competitive position of our products or prevent us from being able to sell products in certain countries. The implementation of more restrictive trade policies, such as more detailed inspections, higher tariffs or new barriers to entry, in countries where we sell large quantities of products and services could negatively impact our business, results of operations and financial condition. For example, a governments adoption of buy national policies or retaliation by another government against such policies could have a negative impact on our results of operations. We may incur additional tax expense or become subject to additional tax exposure.  We are subject to income taxes in the United States and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Our domestic and international tax liabilities are dependent upon the location of earnings among these different jurisdictions. Our future results of operations could be adversely affected by changes in the effective tax rate as a result of a change in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in our overall profitability, changes in tax laws or treaties or in their application or interpretation, changes in tax rates, repatriation of cash to the United States, changes in generally accepted accounting principles, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, changes in the amount of earnings indefinitely reinvested offshore, the results of audits and examinations of previously filed tax returns and continuing assessments of our tax exposures. We are also subject to the continuous examination of our income tax returns by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities. We regularly assess the likelihood of an adverse outcome resulting from these examinations. If our effective tax rates were to increase, or if the ultimate determination of our taxes owed is for an amount in excess of amounts previously accrued, our operating results, cash flows and financial condition could be adversely affected. For information regarding additional legal matters related to our taxes, please see Note 5  \"Income taxes\" and Note 22  \"Environmental and legal matters\" of Part II, Item 8 \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\" to this Annual Report on Form 10-K . Costs associated with lawsuits or investigations or adverse rulings in enforcement or other legal proceedings may have an adverse effect on our results of operations.  We are subject to a variety of legal proceedings and legal compliance risks in virtually every part of the world. We face an inherent business risk of exposure to various types of claims, lawsuits and government investigations. We are involved in various intellectual property, product liability, product warranty and environmental claims and lawsuits and other legal proceedings that arise in and outside of the ordinary course of our business. The industries in which we operate are also periodically reviewed or investigated by regulators, which could lead to enforcement actions, fines and penalties or the assertion of private litigation claims. It is not possible to predict with certainty the outcome of claims, investigations and lawsuits, and we could in the future incur judgments, fines or penalties or enter into settlements of lawsuits and claims that could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition in any particular period. The global and diverse nature of our operations means that legal and compliance risks will continue to exist and additional legal proceedings and other contingencies, the outcome of which cannot be predicted with certainty, will arise from time to time. In addition, subsequent developments in legal proceedings may affect our assessment and estimates of loss contingencies recorded as a reserve and require us to make payments in excess of our reserves, which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations. New regulations or changes in financial services regulation could adversely impact Caterpillar and Cat Financial.  Cat Financials operations are highly regulated by governmental authorities in the locations where it operates, which can impose significant additional costs and/or restrictions on its business. In the U.S., for example, certain of Cat Financials activities are subject to the U.S. Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Dodd-Frank), which includes extensive provisions regulating the financial services industry. As such, Cat Financial has become and could continue to become subject to additional regulatory costs that could be significant  and have an adverse effect on Cat Financial's and our results of operations and financial condition. Additional regulations in the U.S. or internationally impacting the financial services industry could also add significant cost or operational constraints that might have an adverse effect on Cat Financial's and our results of operations and financial condition. We are subject to stringent environmental laws and regulations that impose significant compliance costs.  Our facilities, operations and products are subject to increasingly stringent environmental laws and regulations globally, including laws and regulations governing emissions to noise, air, discharges to water and the generation, handling, storage, transportation, treatment and disposal of non-hazardous and hazardous waste materials. Some environmental laws impose strict, retroactive and joint and several liability for the remediation of the release of hazardous substances, even for conduct that was lawful at the time it occurred, or for the conduct of, or conditions caused by, prior operators, predecessors or other third parties. Failure to comply with environmental laws could expose us to penalties or clean-up costs, civil or criminal liability and sanctions on certain of our activities, as well as damage to property or natural resources. The potential liabilities, sanctions, damages and remediation efforts related to any non-compliance with such laws and regulations could negatively impact our ability to conduct our operations and our financial condition and results of operations. In addition, there can be no assurances that we will not be adversely affected by costs, liabilities or claims with respect to existing or subsequently acquired operations or under present laws and regulations or those that may be adopted or imposed in the future. Environmental laws and regulations may also change from time to time, as may related interpretations and other guidance. Changes in environmental laws or regulations could result in higher expenses and payments, and uncertainty relating to environmental laws or regulations may also affect how we conduct our operations and structure our investments and could limit our ability to enforce our rights. Changes in environmental and climate change laws or regulations, including laws relating to greenhouse gas emissions, could lead to new or additional investment in product designs and could increase environmental compliance expenditures. Changes in climate change concerns, or in the regulation of such concerns, including greenhouse gas emissions, could subject us to additional costs and restrictions, including increased energy and raw materials costs. If environmental laws or regulations are either changed or adopted and impose significant operational restrictions and compliance requirements upon us or our products, they could negatively impact our business, capital expenditures, results of operations, financial condition and competitive position. ##TABLE_START ", "1B": " Item 1B.

Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. ##TABLE_END  This Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations should be read in conjunction with our discussion of cautionary statements and significant risks to the companys business under Item 1A. Risk Factors of the 2016 Form 10-K. OVERVIEW Our sales and revenues for 2016 were $38.537 billion, down $8.474 billion, or 18 percent, from $47.011 billion in 2015. Sales declined across the company reflecting weak end-user demand in most of the industries we serve including in construction, oil and gas, mining and rail. A loss of $67 million was incurred in 2016, compared with profit of $2.512 billion in 2015. The decline was primarily due to lower sales volume , the unfavorable impact of higher mark-to-market losses related to remeasurement of our pension and other postemployment benefits (OPEB) plans, unfavorable price realization and a goodwill impairment charge in Resource Industries . These unfavorable items were partially offset by lower costs resulting from restructuring and other cost reduction actions. Fourth-quarter 2016 sales and revenues were $9.574 billion, a 13 percent decrease from $11.030 billion in the fourth quarter of 2015. A loss of $1.171 billion was incurred in the fourth quarter of 2016 compared with a loss of $94 million in the fourth quarter of 2015. The loss was $2.00 per share in the fourth quarter of 2016 compared with a loss per share of $0.16 in the fourth quarter of 2015. Profit declined primarily due to the unfavorable impact of increased mark-to-market losses related to remeasurement of our pension and OPEB plans, a goodwill impairment charge and lower sales volume. These unfavorable items were partially offset by lower costs resulting from restructuring and other cost reduction actions and lower restructuring costs . Highlights for 2016 include: ##TABLE_START  Sales and revenues in 2016 were $38.537 billion, down 18 percent from 2015. Sales declined in all segments and all regions. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Results for both 2015 and 2016 included significant restructuring costs and 2016 also included three large non-cash items. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Restructuring costs were $1.019 billion in 2016, or $1.16 per share, compared with restructuring costs of $898 million in 2015, or $0.98 per share. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Mark-to-market losses related to remeasurement of our pension and OPEB plans were $985 million in 2016, or $1.15 per share, a significant increase from mark-to-market losses in 2015 of $179 million, or $0.19 per share. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Results for 2016 included a goodwill impairment charge in Resource Industries of $595 million, or $0.98 per share. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Results for 2016 included a $141 million charge to increase deferred tax valuation allowances, or $0.24 per share. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  The loss per share was $0.11 for 2016, and excluding the above items, adjusted profit was $3.42 per share. For 2015, profit per share was $4.18, and excluding restructuring costs and mark-to-market losses, adjusted profit was $5.35 per share. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Inventory declined about $900 million during the fourth quarter of 2016. For the full year, inventory decreased about $1.1 billion. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Machinery, Energy  Transportation (MET) operating cash flow for 2016 was about $3.9 billion, more than sufficient to cover capital expenditures and dividends. ##TABLE_END Restructuring Costs In 2016, we continued to undertake a wide range of actions across the enterprise to lower our cost structure in response to weak economic conditions. Restructuring costs of $395 million in the fourth quarter of 2016 were related to restructuring programs across the company. During 2016, we incurred $1.019 billion in restructuring costs, primarily related to Resource Industries and Energy  Transportation . In 2017, we expect restructuring actions to continue and anticipate costs of about $500 million. Notes: ##TABLE_START  Effective January 1, 2016, we made several changes that impacted the accounting for pension and other postemployment benefits. We also made changes to organizational accountabilities and internal reporting that impacted segment results. Our 2015 financial information has been recast to be consistent with the 2016 presentation. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Glossary of terms included on pages 47 to 49; first occurrence of terms shown in bold italics. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Information on non-GAAP financial measures is included on pages 62-63. ##TABLE_END2016 COMPARED WITH 2015 CONSOLIDATED SALES AND REVENUES The chart above graphically illustrates reasons for the change in Consolidated Sales and Revenues between 2015 (at left) and 2016 (at right). Items favorably impacting sales and revenues appear as upward stair steps with the corresponding dollar amounts above each bar, while items negatively impacting sales and revenues appear as downward stair steps with dollar amounts reflected in parentheses above each bar. Caterpillar management utilizes these charts internally to visually communicate with the company's Board of Directors and employees. Total sales and revenues were $38.537 billion in 2016, compared with $47.011 billion in 2015, a decline of $8.474 billion, or 18 percent. The decrease was primarily due to lower sales volume attributable to continued weak commodity prices globally and economic weakness in many countries. While sales for both new equipment and aftermarket parts declined, most of the decrease was for new equipment.  The unfavorable impact of price realization, primarily in Construction Industries , also contributed to the decline. Sales volume was also unfavorably impacted by changes in dealer machine and engine inventories as inventories decreased about $1.6 billion in 2016 compared with a decrease of about $1.0 billion in 2015. The unfavorable impact of changes in dealer inventories was primarily in North America. Dealers are independent, and there could be many reasons for changes in their inventory levels, including their expectations of future demand and product delivery times. Dealers demand expectations take into account seasonal changes, macroeconomic conditions, machine rental rates and other factors. Delivery times can vary based on availability of product from Caterpillar factories and product distribution centers. We believe some of the expected dealer inventory reduction is a result of increased machine availability through our factories and product distribution centers. We do not expect dealers will reduce inventories in 2017 as much as they did in 2016. We believe the level of dealer inventories at the end of 2017 will depend on dealer expectations for business in 2018. Sales declined in all regions.  In North America, sales decreased 19 percent due to lower end-user demand primarily driven by Construction Industries and Energy  Transportation, and the unfavorable impact of changes in dealer inventories, primarily in Construction Industries. In EAME , sales declined 22 percent, primarily in Africa/Middle East due to weak economic conditions resulting from low oil and other commodity prices and an uncertain investment environment. Sales decreased 29 percent in Latin America , primarily due to widespread economic weakness across the region. The most significant decreases were in Mexico and Brazil.  Asia/Pacific sales declined 9 percent, primarily due to lower end-user demand for Energy  Transportation applications and products used in mining, partially offset by an increase in demand for construction equipment mostly in China. Energy  Transportations sales declined 22 percent, largely due to lower end-user demand for oil and gas and transportation applications. Construction Industries sales decreased 12 percent due to lower demand from end users, unfavorable price realization and the unfavorable impact of changes in dealer inventories.  Resource Industries sales declined 26 percent, mostly due to continued low end-user demand. Financial Products segment revenues were about flat. CONSOLIDATED OPERATING PROFIT The chart above graphically illustrates reasons for the change in Consolidated Operating Profit between 2015 (at left) and 2016 (at right). Items favorably impacting operating profit  appear as upward stair steps with the corresponding dollar amounts above each bar, while items negatively impacting operating profit appear as downward stair steps with dollar amounts reflected in parentheses above each bar. Caterpillar management utilizes these charts internally to visually communicate with the company's Board of Directors and employees. The bar entitled Other includes consolidating adjustments and Machinery, Energy  Transportation other operating (income) expenses . Operating profit for 2016 was $498 million, compared with $3.785 billion in 2015. The decrease in profit is primarily due to lower sales volume, including an unfavorable mix of products. Our expectation is that sales mix will continue to be unfavorable in 2017. The decrease in profit also includes an unfavorable impact from mark-to-market losses related to remeasurement of our pension and OPEB plans and a goodwill impairment charge in Resource Industries. In addition, price realization, Financial Products and restructuring costs were unfavorable. These items were partially offset by favorable period costs and variable manufacturing costs . The unfavorable price realization resulted from competitive market conditions, primarily in Construction Industries. We saw competitive pressure during 2016 that started in the last half of 2015 driven by excess industry capacity, unfavorable currency pressure as the impact of the strong dollar benefited competitors based outside the United States and an overall weak economic environment. While we do not expect substantial price improvement in the coming months, we do expect price realization to be neutral to slightly positive in 2017. Period costs were lower, primarily due to the impact from substantial restructuring and cost reduction actions and lower short-term incentive compensation expense. The reductions primarily impacted period manufacturing costs and selling, general and administrative expenses (SGA). Variable manufacturing costs were favorable primarily due to improved material costs and the favorable impact of cost absorption. Cost absorption was favorable due to inventory decreasing more significantly in 2015 compared to the decrease in 2016. Restructuring costs of $1.019 billion in 2016 were related to multiple restructuring actions across the company, primarily in Resource Industries and Energy  Transportation.  In 2015, restructuring costs were $898 million. Short-term incentive compensation expense is directly related to financial and operational performance measured against targets set annually. Expense in 2016 was about $250 million as compared to about $585 million in 2015. For 2017, we expect short-term incentive compensation expense will be significantly higher than 2016. Other Profit/Loss Items ##TABLE_START  Other income/expense in 2016 was income of $146 million, compared with income of $161 million in 2015. The unfavorable change was primarily due to the absence of a gain of $120 million on the sale of the remaining 35 percent ##TABLE_ENDinterest in our former third-party logistics business. This was mostly offset by a favorable net impact from currency translation and hedging gains and losses. Currency translation and hedging net losses in 2016 were significantly less than the net losses in 2015. ##TABLE_START  The provision for income taxes for 2016 reflects an annual effective tax rate of 36.4 percent compared to 25.5 percent for 2015, excluding the items discussed in the paragraph below. The increase is primarily due to the negative impact from the portion of the Surface Mining  Technology goodwill impairment not deductible for tax purposes offsetting a favorable geographic mix of profits from a tax perspective. The effective tax rate related to 2016 full-year adjusted profit before tax is 26 percent. ##TABLE_END The provision for income taxes for 2016 also includes a $141 million non-cash charge for increases in the valuation allowance for U.S. state deferred tax assets due to recent U.S. GAAP losses expected to recur in 2017 in certain state jurisdictions and the weight given this negative objective evidence under income tax accounting guidance. The provision for income taxes for 2015 also included a $42 million net charge to adjust prior years U.S. taxes.

The decrease in sales was primarily due to lower volume and unfavorable price realization. While sales declined for both new equipment and aftermarket parts, most of the decrease was for new equipment. ##TABLE_START  The sales volume decline was primarily due to a decrease in deliveries to end users and the unfavorable impact of changes in dealer inventories. Dealers lowered inventories more significantly in 2016 than in 2015. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Price realization was unfavorable $539 million due to competitive market conditions resulting from excess industry capacity and an overall weak economic environment. ##TABLE_END Sales decreased in North America, EAME and Latin America and were higher in Asia/Pacific. ##TABLE_START  In North America, the sales decline was primarily due to lower end-user demand.  The sales decline was also due to a decrease in dealer inventories in 2016 compared to relatively flat inventories in 2015. Unfavorable price realization resulted from competitive market conditions. The availability of used equipment has negatively impacted sales in North America during 2016 and we expect some negative impact in 2017. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Lower sales in EAME were primarily due to lower end-user demand and the unfavorable impact of changes in dealer inventories. In addition, price realization was unfavorable across the region due to competitive market conditions. Dealer inventories decreased in 2016 while inventories remained flat in 2015. We expect sales in Africa/Middle East to be negatively impacted ##TABLE_ENDin 2017 due to overall economic weakness and continued pressure on economies that rely on oil revenues to drive economic growth. ##TABLE_START  In Latin America, end-user demand was down across most of the region, with the most significant decline in Brazil due to weak economic conditions. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Sales in Asia/Pacific were higher as a result of an increase in end-user demand primarily in China stemming from increased government support in infrastructure and residential investment. In addition, the impact of changes in dealer inventories was favorable as inventories increased slightly in 2016 compared to a decrease in inventories in 2015. ##TABLE_END Construction Industries profit was $1.650 billion in 2016, compared with $1.865 billion in 2015. The decrease in profit was primarily due to lower sales volume and unfavorable price realization resulting from competitive market conditions. The decline was partially offset by favorable costs, primarily due to the impact from restructuring and cost reduction actions, improved material costs, the favorable impact of cost absorption and the absence of an unfavorable impact from litigation in 2015. The impact of cost absorption was favorable as inventory decreased more significantly in 2015 than in 2016. Resource Industries Resource Industries sales were $5.726 billion in 2016, a decrease of $2.013 billion, or 26 percent, from 2015. The decline was almost entirely due to lower sales volume. Sales were lower for both new equipment and aftermarket parts, however, most of the decrease was for new equipment. Aftermarket parts sales have increased sequentially in each of the last three quarters. The sales decrease was primarily due to lower end-user demand across all regions. While most commodity prices improved in the fourth quarter over a year earlier, current prices have not been sufficient to drive an increase in short-term demand for new equipment. We believe commodity prices must stabilize for a longer period of time to positively impact our sales. We believe idle mining trucks on customer sites are also having a negative impact on end-user demand. In 2016, mining customers continued to focus on improving productivity in existing mines and reducing their total capital expenditures, as they have for several years. We believe miners capital spending will be about flat in 2017 after several years of decline. However, we believe commodity prices at higher levels than a year ago, along with sequential improvements in part sales in each of the last three quarters of 2016 and improvements in quoting and order activity in the fourth quarter of 2016, reflect positive trends in Resource Industries that, if sustained, could positively impact future results. Resource Industries incurred a loss of $1.047 billion in 2016, compared with profit of $1 million in 2015. The most significant item impacting 2016 was a goodwill impairment charge of $595 million related to the Surface Mining  Technology reporting unit. Excluding the impairment charge, the remaining unfavorable change was mostly due to lower sales volume and unfavorable price realization. These items were partially offset by lower costs due to the impact from restructuring and cost reduction actions, improved material costs and lower short-term incentive compensation expense. Energy  Transportation Energy  Transportations sales were $14.411 billion in 2016, a decrease of $4.108 billion, or 22 percent, from 2015. The decrease was almost entirely the result of lower sales volume. Sales decreased in all applications with oil and gas and transportation representing nearly 80 percent of the Energy  Transportation decline. ##TABLE_START  Oil and Gas - Sales continued to decrease in all regions due to low oil prices. Although oil prices were low in 2015 and 2016, our sales during the first half of 2015 benefited from a strong order backlog. The sales decline was most significant in equipment used for production, drilling and well servicing. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Transportation - Sales decreased in all geographic regions. The most significant decline was in North America, primarily due to significant weakness in the rail industry that we expect will persist in 2017. Rail remains challenged with low traffic volume and a significant number of idle locomotives. We believe our sales into the rail industry, including rail services and aftermarket, are being negatively impacted by idled fleets resulting from weak commodity prices. We expect the availability of our North American Tier 4 freight locomotive offering to positively impact sales in 2017. In Asia/Pacific, the decrease was due to the absence of a large sale of locomotives in 2015 and a decline in demand for equipment used in marine applications, primarily for work boats. Demand in Latin America and EAME were also negatively impacted by the weakness in the rail industry. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Power Generation - Sales decreased in all regions, but primarily in EAME. The decline in EAME was primarily a result of continued weakness in the Middle East with continued low oil prices limiting investments. We expect low oil prices will continue to limit investments in oil-producing regions of Africa/Middle East in 2017. The declines in both North America and Asia/Pacific were primarily due to the absence of several large projects and weakness in power generation demand for oil and gas development. The decline in Latin America was primarily due to weak economic conditions. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Industrial - Sales were lower in EAME, North America and Latin America and about flat in Asia Pacific. The decline in sales was primarily due to lower end-user demand for most industrial applications. ##TABLE_END Energy  Transportations profit was $2.222 billion in 2016, compared with $3.390 billion in 2015. The decline was due to a decrease in sales volume, including an unfavorable mix of products. This was partially offset by lower costs primarily due to restructuring and cost reduction actions, favorable material costs and lower short-term incentive compensation expense. Financial Products Segment Financial Products revenues were $2.993 billion, a decrease of $85 million, or 3 percent, from 2015. The decline was primarily due to lower average earning assets in Asia/Pacific and Latin America, an unfavorable impact from returned or repossessed equipment, primarily in North America and lower average financing rates in Latin America. These decreases were partially offset by higher average financing rates and higher average earning assets in North America. Financial Products profit was $702 million in 2016, compared with $809 million in 2015. The decrease was primarily due to an unfavorable impact from returned or repossessed equipment, an unfavorable impact from lower average earning assets, a decrease in net yield on average earning assets reflecting geographic mix changes and an increase in the provision for credit losses at Cat Financial. These unfavorable impacts were partially offset by a decrease in SGA expenses. At the end of 2016, past dues at Cat Financial were 2.38 percent, compared with 2.14 percent at the end of 2015. The increase in past dues was primarily driven by the European marine portfolio. Write-offs, net of recoveries, were $123 million for the full-year 2016, compared with $155 million for the full-year 2015. As of December 31, 2016, Cat Financial's allowance for credit losses totaled $343 million, or 1.29 percent of net finance receivables, compared with $338 million, or 1.22 percent of net finance receivables at year-end 2015. Corporate Items and Eliminations Expense for corporate items and eliminations was $2.712 billion in 2016, which was an increase of $766 million compared with 2015. Corporate items and eliminations include: corporate-level expenses; restructuring costs; timing differences, as some expenses are reported in segment profit on a cash basis; retirement benefit costs other than service cost; currency differences for MET, as segment profit is reported using annual fixed exchange rates; cost of sales methodology differences as segments use a current cost methodology; and inter-segment eliminations. The most significant item was the unfavorable impact of mark-to-market losses related to remeasurement of our pension and OPEB plans. Mark-to-market losses in 2016 were $985 million compared to mark-to-market losses of $179 million in 2015. The remaining decrease in expense of $40 million was primarily due to a favorable impact from methodology differences, partially offset by a $121 million increase in restructuring costs. FOURTH QUARTER 2016 COMPARED WITH FOURTH QUARTER 2015  CONSOLIDATED SALES AND REVENUES The chart above graphically illustrates reasons for the change in Consolidated Sales and Revenues between the fourth quarter of 2015 (at left) and the fourth quarter of 2016 (at right). Items favorably impacting sales and revenues appear as upward stair steps with the corresponding dollar amounts above each bar, while items negatively impacting sales and revenues appear as downward stair steps with dollar amounts reflected in parentheses above each bar. Caterpillar management utilizes these charts internally to visually communicate with the company's Board of Directors and employees. Total sales and revenues were $9.574 billion in the fourth quarter of 2016, a decline of $1.456 billion, or 13 percent, compared with $11.030 billion in the fourth quarter of 2015. The decrease was almost entirely due to lower sales volume, resulting from lower end-user demand attributable to continued weak commodity prices globally and economic weakness in many countries. Although some commodity prices improved in the fourth quarter of 2016, the improvement was too recent to significantly impact our sales for the quarter. Sales for new equipment declined, while aftermarket parts sales were about flat. The unfavorable impact of price realization also contributed to the decline. Sales declined in all regions except Asia/Pacific. In EAME, sales declined 30 percent primarily in Africa/Middle East due to weak economic conditions resulting from the continuing impact of low oil prices and an uncertain investment environment. In North America, sales decreased 15 percent primarily due to lower end-user demand for equipment used for infrastructure, the impact of continued low oil prices and an uncertain economic environment. Sales decreased 16 percent in Latin America primarily due to continued widespread economic weakness and inflation across the region. Asia/Pacific sales increased 10 percent primarily due to increased infrastructure and residential investment in China. Energy  Transportations sales declined 15 percent largely due to lower end-user demand for most applications. Resource Industries sales declined 23 percent mostly due to continued low end-user demand. Construction Industries sales decreased 8 percent primarily due to lower demand from end users, partially offset by favorable changes in dealer inventories. Financial Products segment revenues were about flat with the fourth quarter of 2015. CONSOLIDATED OPERATING PROFIT / (LOSS) The chart above graphically illustrates reasons for the change in Consolidated Operating Profit (Loss) between the fourth quarter of 2015 (at left) and the fourth quarter of 2016 (at right). Items favorably impacting operating profit  appear as upward stair steps with the corresponding dollar amounts above each bar, while items negatively impacting operating profit appear as downward stair steps with dollar amounts reflected in parentheses above each bar. Caterpillar management utilizes these charts internally to visually communicate with the company's Board of Directors and employees. The bar entitled Other includes consolidating adjustments and Machinery, Energy  Transportation other operating (income) expenses. Operating loss for the fourth quarter of 2016 was $1.262 billion, compared with a loss of $175 million in the fourth quarter of 2015, an unfavorable change of $1.087 billion. The most significant items were the unfavorable impact from mark-to-market losses related to pension and OPEB plans and a goodwill impairment charge in Resource Industries. Excluding these items, operating profit improved $279 million compared to the fourth quarter of 2015. The improvement was mostly due to lower period costs, a decrease in restructuring costs and favorable variable manufacturing costs, partially offset by lower sales volume. The unfavorable price realization resulted from competitive market conditions, primarily in Resource Industries. Period costs were lower primarily due to substantial restructuring and cost reduction actions over the past year. The reductions impacted period manufacturing costs, selling, general and administrative expenses and research and development expenses about equally. Variable manufacturing costs were favorable mostly due to the impact of cost absorption as inventory decreased more significantly in the fourth quarter of 2015, compared to the fourth quarter of 2016. Restructuring costs of $395 million in the fourth quarter of 2016 were related to restructuring programs across the company. In the fourth quarter of 2015, restructuring costs were $679 million, primarily related to a reduction in workforce. Other Profit/Loss Items ##TABLE_START  Other income/expense in the fourth quarter of 2016 was income of $34 million, compared with income of $54 million in the fourth quarter of 2015. The unfavorable change was primarily due to lower gains from the sales of securities in the fourth quarter of 2016, compared to the fourth quarter of 2015, and the impact from currency  translation and hedging gains and losses. The unfavorable change in currency translation and hedging gains and losses was due to higher net losses in the fourth quarter of 2016, compared to the fourth quarter of 2015. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  The provision for income taxes in the fourth quarter reflects an annual effective tax rate of 36.4 percent compared to 25.5 percent for the full-year 2015, excluding the items discussed below. The effective tax rate related to 2016 full-year adjusted profit before tax is 26 percent. ##TABLE_END The provision for income taxes for the fourth quarter of 2016 also includes a $170 million charge related to the change from the third-quarter estimated annual tax rate of 25 percent. The increase is primarily due to the negative impact from the portion of the Surface Mining  Technology goodwill impairment not deductible for tax purposes offsetting benefits related to the majority of pension and OPEB mark-to-market losses taxed at higher U.S. rates. In addition, the provision for income taxes for 2016 also includes a $141 million non-cash charge for increases in the valuation allowance for U.S. state deferred tax assets due to recent U.S. GAAP losses expected to recur in 2017 in certain state jurisdictions and the weight given this negative objective evidence under income tax accounting guidance. The provision for income taxes for the fourth quarter of 2015 also included a benefit of $92 million related to the decrease from the third-quarter estimated annual tax rate, primarily due to the renewal in the fourth quarter of the U.S. research and development tax credit for 2015.

Sales declined for new equipment and were about flat for aftermarket parts. ##TABLE_START  Sales volume declined primarily due to lower end-user demand, partially offset by a smaller decline in dealer inventories in the fourth quarter of 2016, compared with the fourth quarter of 2015. ##TABLE_END Sales decreased in EAME, North America and Latin America and increased in Asia/Pacific. ##TABLE_START  Sales in EAME decreased primarily due to lower end-user demand. The sales decline was primarily in oil-producing economies in Africa/Middle East due to continued low oil prices and an uncertain investment environment. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  In North America, the sales decline was primarily due to lower end-user demand. Although residential and non-residential building construction activity improved, we believe demand for new construction equipment has remained low due to end users utilization of existing used equipment. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  In Latin America, sales decreased slightly as lower end-user demand, attributable to weak economic conditions across the region, was partially offset by favorable changes in dealer inventories. Dealers reduced inventories more significantly in the fourth quarter of 2015 than in the fourth quarter of 2016. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Sales in Asia/Pacific were higher as a result of an increase in end-user demand primarily in China stemming from increased government support for infrastructure and residential investment. In addition, changes in Asia/Pacific dealer inventories were ##TABLE_ENDfavorable as dealers increased inventories in the fourth quarter of 2016, compared with a decrease in the fourth quarter of 2015. Construction Industries profit was $334 million in the fourth quarter of 2016, compared with $178 million in the fourth quarter of 2015. The increase in profit was primarily due to lower period costs and the absence of an unfavorable impact from litigation in the fourth quarter of 2015, partially offset by lower sales volume, which includes a favorable mix of products. The lower period costs were mostly a result of the favorable impact of restructuring and cost reduction actions. Resource Industries Resource Industries sales were $1.443 billion in the fourth quarter of 2016, a decrease of $435 million, or 23 percent, from the fourth quarter of 2015. The decline was primarily due to lower sales volume and the unfavorable impact of price realization resulting from competitive market conditions. Sales of new equipment decreased while sales of aftermarket parts increased slightly. Aftermarket parts sales have increased sequentially in each of the last three quarters. The sales decrease was primarily due to lower end-user demand across all regions. While most commodity prices were higher in the fourth quarter of 2016 than in the fourth quarter of 2015, current prices have not been sufficient to drive much increase in short-term demand for new equipment. We believe commodity prices now need to stabilize for a longer period of time to positively impact our sales. Mining customers continued to focus on improving productivity in existing mines and reducing their total capital expenditures, as they have for several years. In addition, sales of heavy construction equipment are lower, primarily in North America. Resource Industries incurred a loss of $711 million in the fourth quarter of 2016, compared with a loss of $80 million in the fourth quarter of 2015. The most significant item impacting the fourth quarter of 2016 was a goodwill impairment charge of $595 million related to the Surface Mining  Technology reporting unit. Excluding the impairment charge, the fourth quarter of 2016 operating loss was unfavorable $36 million, compared with the fourth quarter of 2015. The unfavorable change was due to lower sales volume and unfavorable price realization, mostly offset by the favorable impact of restructuring and cost reduction actions. Energy  Transportation Energy  Transportations sales were $3.849 billion in the fourth quarter of 2016, a decrease of $695 million, or 15 percent, from the fourth quarter of 2015. The decrease was primarily the result of lower sales volume. ##TABLE_START  Transportation - Sales decreased in North America, Asia/Pacific and EAME primarily due to continued weakness in the rail industry, with the most significant decline in North America. The North American rail industry continues to be depressed with a significant number of idle locomotives that impacted demand for rail services and aftermarket. The decline in Asia/Pacific was mostly due to lower demand for equipment used in marine applications, primarily for work boats. Sales in Latin America were about flat. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Oil and Gas - Sales decreased in much of the world due to the impact from low oil prices. The sales decline was primarily related to lower demand across all regions for equipment used for production, partially offset by increased demand for turbines used for gas compression. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Power Generation - Sales decreased in EAME and were about flat in all other regions. The decline in EAME was primarily a result of continued weakness in the Middle East with continued low oil prices limiting investments. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Industrial - Sales were about flat as an increase in Asia/Pacific was mostly offset by a decrease in EAME, both attributable to changes in end-user demand for most industrial applications. ##TABLE_END Energy  Transportations profit was $638 million in the fourth quarter of 2016, compared with $741 million in the fourth quarter of 2015. The decline was primarily due to a decrease in sales volume, partially offset by the impact of restructuring and cost reduction actions and a favorable impact of cost absorption as inventory decreased more significantly in the fourth quarter of 2015 than the fourth quarter of 2016. Financial Products Segment Financial Products revenues were $742 million in the fourth quarter of 2016, a decrease of $4 million, or 1 percent, from the fourth quarter of 2015. The decline was primarily due to lower average earning assets in North America and Latin America, an unfavorable impact from returned or repossessed equipment primarily in North America and lower average financing rates in Latin America. These decreases were partially offset by higher average financing rates in North America. Financial Products profit was $149 million in the fourth quarter of 2016, compared with $191 million in the fourth quarter of 2015. The decrease was primarily due to lower gains on sales of securities at Insurance Services and an unfavorable impact from returned or repossessed equipment. Corporate Items and Eliminations Expense for corporate items and eliminations was $1.581 billion in the fourth quarter of 2016, an increase of $478 million from the fourth quarter of 2015. Corporate items and eliminations include: corporate-level expenses; restructuring costs; timing differences, as some expenses are reported in segment profit on a cash basis; retirement benefit costs other than service cost; currency differences for MET, as segment profit is reported using annual fixed exchange rates; cost of sales methodology differences as segments use a current cost methodology; and inter-segment eliminations. The increase was due to the unfavorable impact of higher mark-to-market losses related to our pension and OPEB plans. Mark-to-market losses in the fourth quarter of 2016 were $985 million, compared to mark-to-market losses of $214 million in the fourth quarter of 2015. This was partially offset by a decrease in restructuring costs of $284 million compared to the fourth quarter of 2015. 2015 COMPARED WITH 2014  CONSOLIDATED SALES AND REVENUES  The chart above graphically illustrates reasons for the change in Consolidated Sales and Revenues between 2014 (at left) and 2015 (at right). Items favorably impacting sales and revenues appear as upward stair steps with the corresponding dollar amounts above each bar, while items negatively impacting sales and revenues appear as downward stair steps with dollar amounts reflected in parentheses above each bar. Caterpillar management utilizes these charts internally to visually communicate with the company's Board of Directors and employees.  Total sales and revenues were $47.011 billion in 2015, down $8.173 billion, or 15 percent, from 2014. The decrease was largely due to lower sales volume, primarily in Energy  Transportation and Construction Industries. Sales volume was also lower in Resource Industries. Currency had an unfavorable impact of $1.7 billion due to continued strengthening of the U.S. dollar against most currencies, with the largest impact from the euro. While sales for both new equipment and aftermarket parts declined in Energy  Transportation, Construction Industries and Resource Industries, most of the decrease was for new equipment. Financial Products revenues declined $178 million. While price realization was about flat from 2014 to 2015, it was positive in the first half of 2015 and negative over the second half of 2015. The two most significant reasons for the decline in sales and revenues from 2014 were weakening economic growth and substantially lower commodity prices. The impact of weak economic growth was most pronounced in developing countries, such as China and Brazil. Lower oil prices had a substantial negative impact on the portion of Energy  Transportation that supports oil drilling and well servicing, where new order rates in 2015 were down close to 90 percent from 2014. The impact of changes in dealer machine and engine inventories was about flat. In total, dealer inventories decreased about $1 billion in both 2015 and 2014. Dealers are independent, and there could be many reasons for changes in their inventory levels. In general, dealers adjust inventory based on their expectations of future demand and product delivery times. Dealers demand expectations take into account seasonal changes, macroeconomic conditions and other factors. Delivery times can vary based on availability of product from Caterpillar factories and product distribution centers. Sales declined in all regions. Sales in North America declined 11 percent, primarily in Energy  Transportation with the most significant decrease in rail applications. Sales also declined in Resource Industries and Construction Industries. In Asia/Pacific, sales declined 19 percent, primarily due to lower end-user demand for construction and mining equipment and oil and gas applications. The impact of currency was also unfavorable, as our sales in Japanese yen and Australian dollars translated into fewer U.S. dollars. In EAME, sales declined 14 percent, primarily due to the unfavorable impact of currency, as our sales in euros translated into fewer U.S. dollars. The remaining sales decline is primarily due to lower sales in Russia as a recession slowed demand and the absence of a large power generation project that occurred in 2014. Latin America sales decreased 28 percent due to lower end-user demand, mostly for construction equipment. The decline was due to continued widespread economic weakness across the region with the most significant decline in Brazil due to continued weak construction activity resulting from depressed economic conditions. By segment, sales decreased in Energy  Transportation, Construction Industries and Resource Industries. Energy  Transportations sales declined 17 percent with much of the decline a result of low oil prices. Construction Industries sales declined 14 percent, primarily due to lower end-user demand and the unfavorable impact of currency. Resource Industries sales declined 15 percent, primarily due to weaker demand for mining products, partially offset by the favorable impact of changes in dealer inventories, as dealer inventories decreased more in 2014 than in 2015. Financial Products' segment revenues decreased 7 percent, primarily due to lower average earning assets and lower average financing rates.  CONSOLIDATED OPERATING PROFIT The chart above graphically illustrates reasons for the change in Consolidated Operating Profit between 2014 (at left) and 2015 (at right). Items favorably impacting operating profit appear as upward stair steps with the corresponding dollar amounts above each bar, while items negatively impacting operating profit appear as downward stair steps with dollar amounts reflected in parentheses above each bar. Caterpillar management utilizes these charts internally to visually communicate with the company's Board of Directors and employees. The bar entitled Other includes consolidating adjustments and Machinery, Energy  Transportation other operating (income) expenses.  Operating profit for 2015 was $3.785 billion, an increase of $471 million from 2014. The most significant item was the favorable impact of lower net mark-to-market losses related to our pension and OPEB plans. Remaining was a decline of $1.974 billion which was primarily the result of lower sales volume, higher restructuring costs and higher variable manufacturing costs, partially offset by lower period costs and the favorable impact of currency. Restructuring costs of $898 million in 2015, included in corporate items, were primarily related to a reduction in workforce across the company. In 2014, restructuring costs were $432 million, primarily related to a workforce reduction at the Gosselies, Belgium, facility and other actions across the company. Our restructuring activities continued in 2015 as part of our efforts to optimize our cost structure and improve the efficiency of our operations. Variable manufacturing costs were higher primarily due to the unfavorable impact of cost absorption as there was a more significant inventory decline in 2015 than 2014, and manufacturing inefficiencies driven by costs decreasing at a lower rate than production volume. These costs were partially offset by improved material costs due to declines in commodity prices and a focus on reducing the cost of components in our products. Period costs were lower primarily due to lower incentive compensation expense, slightly offset by higher spending for new product introductions. The favorable impact of currency was primarily due to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar in relation to the Japanese yen and British pound, as we are a net exporter from Japan and the United Kingdom. Short-term incentive compensation expense related to 2015 was about $585 million compared to about $1.3 billion of short-term incentive compensation expense related to 2014. Short-term incentive compensation expense is directly related to financial and operational performance measured against targets set annually. Other Profit/Loss Items Other income/expense was income of $161 million in 2015, compared with income of $322 million in 2014. The change was primarily due to the unfavorable net impact of currency translation and hedging gains and losses, partially offset by a gain of $120 million on the sale of the remaining 35 percent interest in our former third party logistics business. Translation and hedging losses in 2015 totaled $173 million primarily due to the Brazilian real and Japanese yen. In 2014, translation and hedging gains were $137 million primarily due to the euro. The provision for income taxes for 2015 reflects an effective tax rate of 25.5 percent compared with 23.4 percent for 2014, excluding the items discussed below. The increase is primarily due to a less favorable geographic mix of profits from a tax perspective in 2015 as lower mark-to-market losses related to our pension and OPEB plans were partially offset by higher restructuring costs, both primarily at higher U.S. tax rates. The provision for income taxes for 2015 also includes a $42 million net charge to increase unrecognized tax benefits by $68 million partially offset by a benefit of $26 million to record U.S. refund claims related to prior tax years currently under examination. Our consideration of decisions by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit in 2015 involving other taxpayers caused us to increase our unrecognized tax benefits related to foreign tax credits that arose as a result of certain financings. The 2014 tax provision also included a benefit of $23 million for the release of a valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets of a non-U.S. subsidiary and a net benefit of $21 million to adjust prior years U.S. taxes and interest.

The sales decrease was due to lower sales volume and the unfavorable impact of currency. While sales for both new equipment and aftermarket parts declined, most of the decrease was for new equipment. ##TABLE_START  The decrease in sales volume was primarily due to lower deliveries to end users caused by widespread economic weakness primarily in developing countries. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  The unfavorable currency impact was primarily from a weaker euro, Japanese yen and Brazilian real, as sales in these currencies translated into fewer U.S. dollars. ##TABLE_END Sales decreased in all geographic regions. ##TABLE_START  In Asia/Pacific, the sales decline was primarily due to lower sales in China and Japan. In China, the lower sales resulted primarily from continued weak residential and nonresidential construction activity. Sales in Japan declined due to a weaker Japanese yen, as sales in yen translated into fewer U.S. dollars. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Decreases in Latin America were primarily related to lower demand due to continued weak construction activity with the most significant impact in Brazil. In addition, the absence of a large government order that occurred in 2014 and the unfavorable impact of a weaker Brazilian real contributed to the decline in sales in Brazil. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Sales declined in EAME primarily due to the unfavorable impact of currency, as sales in euros translated into fewer U.S. dollars. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  In North America, the sales decline was due to both lower end-user demand and unfavorable changes in dealer inventory, as dealer inventories remained relatively flat in 2015 compared to an increase in 2014. Lack of investment in oil and gas-related construction activity and a decline in infrastructure spending were partially offset by stronger activity in residential and nonresidential building construction. We believe declines in construction activity related to oil and gas resulted in availability of existing construction equipment for other purposes. ##TABLE_END Construction Industries profit was $1.865 billion in 2015, compared with $2.133 billion in 2014. The decrease in profit was primarily due to lower sales volume, partially offset by lower costs, and the favorable impact of currency. The decline in costs was primarily due to lower incentive compensation expense and improved material costs. Resource Industries Resource Industries sales were $7.739 billion in 2015, a decrease of $1.395 billion, or 15 percent, from 2014, primarily due to lower sales volume and the unfavorable impact of currency, mostly the euro and Australian dollar. Price realization was slightly unfavorable, resulting from a competitive pricing environment. Sales declined for both new equipment and aftermarket parts. We believe some mining companies were curtailing maintenance and rebuild activities. Commodity prices were weak, and mining customers focused on improving productivity in existing mines and reducing their total capital expenditures as they did for the last several years. As a result, sales and new orders in Resource Industries weakened. The sales volume decrease was partially offset by the favorable impact of changes in dealer inventories. As dealers reduced inventories in 2015, the reductions were less significant than in 2014. Sales decreased in all geographic regions. ##TABLE_START  In EAME, the sales decline was primarily due to lower end-user demand and the unfavorable impact of currency due to a weaker euro, as sales in euro translated into fewer U.S. dollars. The decline was partially offset by the favorable impact of changes in dealer inventories. As dealers reduced inventories in 2015, the reductions were less significant than in 2014. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  In North America, the sales decline was primarily due to lower end-user demand driven by lower sales of mining equipment partially offset by increases in sales of equipment used to support the quarry and aggregate industry and the favorable impact of changes in dealer inventories. As dealers reduced inventories in 2015, the reductions were less significant than in 2014. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Sales declined in Asia/Pacific primarily due to lower end-user demand and the unfavorable impact of currency, mostly due to the Australian dollar, as sales translated into fewer U.S. dollars, partially offset by the favorable impact of changes in dealer inventories. As dealers reduced inventories in 2015, the reductions were less significant than in 2014. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Decreases in Latin America were primarily related to continued weak mining activity and slightly unfavorable price realization resulting from a competitive pricing environment. The decline was partially offset by the favorable impact of changes in dealer inventories. As dealers reduced inventories in 2015, the reductions were less significant than in 2014. ##TABLE_END Resource Industries profit was $1 million in 2015, compared with profit of $565 million in 2014. The decrease was primarily the result of lower sales volume, higher spending for new product introductions and unfavorable price realization, partially offset by improved material costs. Energy  Transportation Energy  Transportations sales were $18.519 billion in 2015, a decrease of $3.787 billion, or 17 percent, from 2014. The sales decrease was primarily due to lower sales volume and the unfavorable impact of currency, mainly from a weaker euro. Sales decreased in all geographic regions and across all applications. ##TABLE_START  Oil and Gas - The sales decrease was driven by lower end-user demand as oil prices continued to decline. Sales decreased in all regions. In North America, sales were lower primarily due to a decline in end-user demand for reciprocating engines used in drilling, well servicing and gas compression applications. Sales declined in Asia/Pacific primarily from lower end-user demand for equipment used in drilling applications and the unfavorable impact of changes in dealer inventories as inventories decreased in 2015 and were about flat in 2014. In Latin America, sales were lower primarily due to the absence of a large project that occurred in 2014. Sales declined in EAME due to depressed oil prices and the unfavorable impact of currency, primarily from a weaker euro. ##TABLE_ENDDuring the first half of 2015, sales remained at relatively high levels for equipment used in gas compression, well servicing and drilling because we started the year with a substantial order backlog. Sales declined during the second half of 2015 as orders from the backlog were shipped and new order levels were weak. ##TABLE_START  Transportation - Sales decreased in North America and were about flat in all other geographic regions. In North America, sales into rail applications decreased primarily due to the absence of a Tier IV locomotive offering and lower sales of recyclable materials. The decline of recyclable materials was driven primarily by the year-over-year decrease in scrap prices and the lower volume of railcars available to scrap. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Power Generation - Sales decreased in EAME and North America and were about flat in all other regions. In EAME, the sales decline was primarily due to lower end-user demand resulting from the absence of a large project that occurred in 2014, weak economic conditions and political instability in the region, and the negative impact of currency. Sales declined in North America mostly due to the absence of several large projects and unfavorable impact of changes in dealer inventories as inventories decreased in 2015 and were about flat in 2014. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Industrial - Sales decreased in all regions except Latin America which was about flat. In EAME, sales decreased primarily due to lower end-user demand for engines used by original equipment manufacturers for agriculture and construction applications and the unfavorable impact of currency. In both Asia/Pacific and North America, lower demand for most industrial applications contributed to the sales decrease. ##TABLE_END Energy  Transportations profit was $3.390 billion in 2015, compared with $4.287 billion in 2014. The decrease was primarily due to lower sales volume, which includes a favorable mix of products, partially offset by lower incentive compensation expense. Variable manufacturing costs were about flat as improved material costs were about offset by the unfavorable impact of cost absorption and manufacturing inefficiencies driven by costs decreasing at a lower rate than production volume. The unfavorable impact of cost absorption resulted from a significant decrease in inventory in 2015, compared to an increase in inventory in 2014. Period costs were favorable as lower incentive compensation expense was slightly offset by increases in program spending including for new product introductions. Financial Products Segment Financial Products revenues were $3.078 billion, a decrease of $235 million, or 7 percent, from 2014. The decline was primarily due to lower average earning assets and lower average financing rates. Average earning assets were down in Asia/Pacific, Latin America and EAME, partially offset by higher average earning assets in North America. Average financing rates decreased primarily in North America and EAME. Financial Products profit was $809 million in 2015, compared with $901 million in 2014. The decrease was primarily due to a $68 million decrease in net yield on average earning assets reflecting changes in the geographic mix of margin and currency impacts and a $55 million unfavorable impact from lower average earning assets, partially offset by a $33 million decrease in the provision for credit losses at Cat Financial. The decrease in provision for credit losses at Cat Financial was primarily due to a favorable impact from changes in the allowance rate and a favorable impact from changes in portfolio balances, partially offset by an increase in write-offs, net of recoveries. The favorable impact from changes in the allowance rate was driven by changes in certain assumptions within the allowance for credit loss model. During 2015, as a result of management's review, the loss emergence period and loss given default assumptions were updated and resulted in a decrease to the allowance for credit losses of $66 million. At the end of 2015, past dues at Cat Financial were 2.14 percent, compared with 2.17 percent at the end of 2014. Write-offs, net of recoveries, were $155 million for the full-year 2015, compared with $104 million for the full-year 2014. The increase in write-offs, net of recoveries, was primarily driven by the mining and marine portfolios. As of December 31, 2015, Cat Financial's allowance for credit losses totaled $338 million, or 1.22 percent of net finance receivables, compared with $401 million, or 1.36 percent of net finance receivables, at year-end 2014. Corporate Items and Eliminations Expense for corporate items and eliminations was $1.946 billion in 2015, a decrease of $2.367 billion from 2014. Corporate items and eliminations include: corporate-level expenses; restructuring costs; timing differences, as some expenses are reported in segment profit on a cash basis; retirement benefit costs other than service cost; currency differences for MET, as segment profit is reported using annual fixed exchange rates, and inter-segment eliminations. The most significant item was the favorable impact of net mark-to-market losses related to our pension and OPEB plans. Net mark-to-market losses in 2015 were $179 million compared to net mark-to-market losses of $2.624 billion in 2014. The remaining increase in expense in 2015 was primarily due to a $466 million increase in restructuring costs and an unfavorable impact from methodology differences, partially offset by a favorable impact from timing differences and lower retirement benefits costs (excluding mark-to-market losses). RESTRUCTURING COSTS Restructuring costs for 2016, 2015 and 2014 were as follows: ##TABLE_START        (Millions of dollars)    Employee separations 1  $  $  $ Contract terminations 1      Long-lived asset impairments 1    Defined benefit retirement plan curtailment losses 1    Other 2     Total restructuring costs  $ 1,019  $  $        1 Recognized in Other operating (income) expenses.       2 Represents costs related to our restructuring programs, primarily for inventory write-downs, accelerated depreciation, sales discounts, project management and equipment relocation and were recognized primarily in Cost of goods sold.        ##TABLE_ENDThe restructuring costs in 2016 were primarily related to actions in Resource Industries in response to continued weakness in the mining industry. In addition, costs resulted from our decision to discontinue production of on-highway vocational trucks and other restructuring actions across the company, most of which were related to our September 2015 announcement regarding significant restructuring and cost reduction actions to lower our operating costs in response to weak economic and business conditions in most of the industries we serve. The restructuring costs in 2015 were primarily related to several restructuring programs across the company. The restructuring costs in 2014 were primarily related to a reduction in workforce at our Gosselies, Belgium, facility. Restructuring costs are a reconciling item between Segment profit and Consolidated profit before taxes. The following table summarizes the 2015 and 2016 employee separation activity: ##TABLE_START   (Millions of dollars)  Liability balance at December 31, 2014 $ Increase in liability (separation charges) Reduction in liability (payments) (340 ) Liability balance at December 31, 2015 $ Increase in liability (separation charges) Reduction in liability (payments) (633 ) Liability balance at December 31, 2016 $   ##TABLE_END As part of our September 2015 announcement, we offered a voluntary retirement enhancement program to qualifying U.S. employees and various voluntary separation programs outside of the U.S. and implemented additional involuntary separation programs throughout the company. In 2016 and 2015, we incurred $100 million and $379 million of employee separation costs related to these programs, respectively. In addition, in 2015 we incurred $82 million of defined benefit retirement plan curtailment losses related to these programs. Substantially all of the employee separation costs related to this program were paid in 2016. We also incurred costs associated with the September 2015 announcement related to manufacturing facility consolidations and closures in 2016 and 2015 totaling $181 million and $108 million, respectively. The remaining liability balance as of December 31, 2016 represents costs for other employee separation programs, most of which are expected to be paid in 2017.  In February 2016, we made the decision to discontinue production of on-highway vocational trucks within Energy  Transportation. Based on the business climate in the truck industry and a thorough evaluation of the business, the company decided it would withdraw from this market. We estimate restructuring costs incurred under the restructuring plan to be $110 million. In 2016, we recognized $104 million of restructuring costs primarily for long-lived asset impairments and sales discounts related to this restructuring plan. The remaining costs are expected to be recognized in 2017. In the second half of 2016, we took additional restructuring actions in Resource Industries, including ending the production of track drills; pursuing strategic alternatives, including the possible divestiture of room and pillar products; consolidation of two product development divisions; and additional actions in response to ongoing weakness in the mining industry. We estimate restructuring costs incurred under these restructuring plans to be $385 million. For the year ended December 31, 2016, we incurred $369 million of restructuring costs related to these plans which included $164 million of long-lived asset impairments, $120 million of employee separation costs, $81 million of inventory write-downs and $4 million of other costs. The remaining costs are expected to be recognized in 2017. In 2017, we expect to incur about $500 million of restructuring costs primarily related to ongoing manufacturing facility consolidations to lower our cost structure in response to weak economic conditions. No estimate of potential restructuring costs for contemplated actions at Gosselies, Belgium, or Aurora, Illinois, has been included. We are expecting about $450 million of cost reduction in 2017 from lower operating costs, primarily SGA expenses and Cost of goods sold resulting from restructuring actions.

Variable manufacturing costs are defined as having a direct relationship with the volume of production. This includes material costs, direct labor and other costs that vary directly with production volume such as freight, power to operate machines and supplies that are consumed in the manufacturing process. ##TABLE_END LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  Sources of funds  We generate significant capital resources from operating activities, which are the primary source of funding for our MET operations. Funding for these businesses is also available from commercial paper and long-term debt issuances. Financial Products' operations are funded primarily from commercial paper, term debt issuances and collections from its existing portfolio. Despite continued weakness in many of the industries we serve, we had positive operating cash flow in 2016. On a consolidated basis, we ended 2016 with $7.17 billion of cash, an increase of $708 million from year-end 2015. We intend to maintain a strong cash and liquidity position. Our cash balances are held in numerous locations throughout the world with approximately $5.2 billion held by our non-U.S. subsidiaries. Amounts held by non-U.S. subsidiaries are available for general corporate use. However, if cash held by non-U.S. subsidiaries were repatriated to the United States, U.S. tax would generally be payable net of any available foreign tax credits.  Consolidated operating cash flow for 2016 was $5.61 billion down from $6.68 billion in 2015. The decrease was primarily due to lower profit after adjustments for non-cash items. The most significant driver of lower earnings was a decrease in sales volume during 2016. Higher payments for employee separations in 2016 than 2015 also contributed to the decline in operating cash flow. Operating cash flow benefited from lower cash payments for short-term incentive compensation in 2016 than 2015 (a portion of this benefit was reflected in profit through lower accruals for incentive compensation expense in 2016). In addition, positive changes to working capital in 2016 favorably impacted operating cash flow. Within working capital, changes to accounts payable and customer advances had favorable impacts to cash flow but were partially offset by lower inventory reductions. These reductions in working capital were also primarily a result of lower sales volume. See further discussion of operating cash flow under MET and Financial Products. Total debt as of December 31, 2016, was $36.78 billion, a decrease of $1.23 billion from year-end 2015. Debt related to Financial Products decreased $896 million, reflecting decreasing portfolio funding requirements. Debt related to MET decreased $334 million in 2016, due to the maturity of a long-term debt issuance.  We have three global credit facilities with a syndicate of banks totaling $10.50 billion (Credit Facility) available in the aggregate to both Caterpillar and Cat Financial for general liquidity purposes. Based on management's allocation decision, which can be revised from time to time, the portion of the Credit Facility available to MET as of December 31, 2016 was $2.75 billion. Our three Global Credit Facilities are: ##TABLE_START  The 364-day facility of $3.15 billion (of which $0.82 billion is available to MET) expires in September 2017. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  The three-year facility, as amended in September 2016, of $2.73 billion (of which $0.72 billion is available to MET) expires in September 2019. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  The five-year facility, as amended in September 2016, of $4.62 billion (of which $1.21 billion is available to MET) expires in September 2021. ##TABLE_END At December 31, 2016, Caterpillar's consolidated net worth was $13.20 billion, which was above the $9.00 billion required under the Credit Facility. The consolidated net worth is defined as the consolidated stockholder's equity including preferred stock but excluding the pension and other postretirement benefits balance within Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). At December 31, 2016, Cat Financial's covenant interest coverage ratio was 1.92 to 1. This is above the 1.15 to 1 minimum ratio, calculated as (1) profit excluding income taxes, interest expense and net gain/(loss) from interest rate derivatives to (2) interest expense calculated at the end of each calendar quarter for the rolling four quarter period then most recently ended, required by the Credit Facility. In addition, at December 31, 2016, Cat Financial's six-month covenant leverage ratio was 7.35 to 1 and year-end covenant leverage ratio was 7.60 to 1. This is below the maximum ratio of debt to net worth of 10 to 1, calculated (1) on a monthly basis as the average of the leverage ratios determined on the last day of each of the six preceding calendar months and (2) at each December 31, required by the Credit Facility. In the event Caterpillar or Cat Financial does not meet one or more of their respective financial covenants under the Credit Facility in the future (and are unable to obtain a consent or waiver), the syndicate of banks may terminate the commitments allocated to the party that does not meet its covenants. Additionally, in such event, certain of Cat Financial's other lenders under other loan agreements where similar financial covenants or cross default provisions are applicable, may, at their election, choose to pursue remedies under those loan agreements, including accelerating the repayment of outstanding borrowings. At December 31, 2016, there were no borrowings under the Credit Facility. Our total credit commitments and available credit as of December 31, 2016 were: ##TABLE_START          December 31, 2016 (Millions of dollars)  Consolidated  Machinery, Energy  Transportation  Financial Products Credit lines available:       Global credit facilities  $ 10,500  $ 2,750  $ 7,750 Other external  3,824   3,764 Total credit lines available  14,324  2,810  11,514 Less: Commercial paper outstanding  (6,135 )  (150 )  (5,985 ) Less: Utilized credit  (1,482 )  (59 )  (1,423 ) Available credit  $ 6,707  $ 2,601  $ 4,106        ##TABLE_END The other consolidated credit lines with banks as of December 31, 2016 totaled $3.82 billion. These committed and uncommitted credit lines, which may be eligible for renewal at various future dates or have no specified expiration date, are used primarily by our subsidiaries for local funding requirements. Caterpillar or Cat Financial may guarantee subsidiary borrowings under these lines.  We receive debt ratings from the major rating agencies. In December 2016, Moody's Investors Service downgraded our long-term ratings to A3 from A2, and short-term ratings to Prime-2 from Prime-1. We do not expect the Moody's downgrade to have a material impact on our borrowing costs or our overall financial health. A further downgrade of our credit ratings by Moody's or one of the other major credit rating agencies would result in increased borrowing costs and could make access to certain credit markets more difficult. In the event economic conditions deteriorate such that access to debt markets becomes unavailable, our MET operations would rely on cash flow from operations, use of existing cash balances, borrowings from Cat Financial and access to our Credit Facility. Our Financial Products operations would rely on cash flow from its existing portfolio, existing cash balances, access to our Credit Facility and other credit line facilities of Cat Financial and potential borrowings from Caterpillar. In addition, we maintain a support agreement with Cat Financial, which requires Caterpillar to remain the sole owner of Cat Financial and may, under certain circumstances, require Caterpillar to make payments to Cat Financial should Cat Financial fail to maintain certain financial ratios. Machinery, Energy  Transportation  Net cash provided by operating activities was $3.86 billion in 2016, compared with $5.18 billion in 2015. The decrease was primarily due to lower profit after adjustments for non-cash items. The most significant driver of lower earnings was a decrease in sales volume during 2016. Higher payments for employee separations in 2016 than 2015 also contributed to the decline in operating cash flow. Operating cash flow benefited from lower cash payments for short-term incentive compensation in 2016 than 2015 (a portion of this benefit was reflected in profit through lower accruals for incentive compensation expense in 2016). In addition, positive changes to working capital in 2016 favorably impacted operating cash flow. Within working capital, changes to accounts payable and customer advances had favorable impacts to cash flow but were partially offset by lower inventory reductions. These reductions in working capital were also primarily a result of lower sales volume. Net cash used for investing activities in both 2016 and 2015 was $1.78 billion. Increased lending activity with Financial Products in 2016 was offset by lower capital expenditures versus 2015. Net cash used for financing activities in 2016 was $2.13 billion, compared with net cash used of $4.24 billion in 2015. The favorable change was primarily due to the absence of common stock repurchases in 2016, as compared to 2015.  Although our short-term priorities for the use of cash may vary from time to time, as business conditions dictate, our long-term cash deployment strategy remains unchanged: to maintain a strong financial position in support of our credit rating, provide capital to support growth, appropriately fund employee benefit plans, pay dividends and repurchase common stock.  Strong financial position   A key measure of MET's financial strength used by management is MET's debt-to-capital ratio. Debt-to-capital is defined as short-term borrowings, long-term debt due within one year and long-term debt due after one year (debt) divided by the sum of debt and stockholders' equity. Debt also includes MET's long-term borrowings from Financial Products. The debt-to-capital ratio for MET was 41.0 percent at December 31, 2016, within our target range of 30 to 45 percent. The MET debt-to-capital ratio was 39.0 percent at December 31, 2015. The increase in the debt-to-capital ratio was due to a decrease in equity primarily resulting from dividend payments.  Capital to support growth   Capital expenditures during 2016 were $1.21 billion. We expect MET's capital expenditures in 2017 to be about flat with 2016.  Appropriately funded employee benefit plans   We made $329 million of contributions to our pension and OPEB plans in 2016 versus $350 million of contributions in 2015. We expect that required employee benefit plan contributions of approximately $610 million will be required in 2017. We believe we have adequate resources to fund our employee benefit plans.  Paying dividends   Dividends paid totaled $1.80 billion in 2016, representing 77 cents per share paid per quarter. Each quarter, our Board of Directors reviews the company's dividend for the applicable quarter. The Board evaluates the financial condition of the company and considers the economic outlook, corporate cash flow, the company's liquidity needs and the health and stability of global credit markets to determine whether to maintain or change the quarterly dividend.  Common stock repurchases   In January 2014, the Board of Directors approved an authorization to repurchase up to $10 billion of Caterpillar common stock (the 2014 Authorization), which will expire on December 31, 2018. We did not purchase any Caterpillar common stock in 2016. As of December 31, 2016, $5.47 billion remained available under the 2014 Authorization. Caterpillar's basic shares outstanding as of December 31, 2016 were 586 million.  Financial Products  Financial Products operating cash flow was $1.55 billion in 2016, compared with $1.39 billion in 2015. Net cash provided by investing activities in 2016 was $299 million, compared with cash used for investing activities of $1.02 billion in 2015. The change was primarily due to lower portfolio funding requirements. Net cash used for financing activities in 2016 was $1.07 billion, compared with $228 million in 2015. The change was primarily due to lower funding requirements for investing activities. ##TABLE_START Dividends paid per common share        Quarter     First  $ .770  $ .700  $ .600  Second  .770  .700  .600  Third  .770  .770  .700  Fourth  .770  .770  .700    $ 3.080  $ 2.940  $ 2.600            ##TABLE_ENDContractual obligations  The company has committed cash outflow related to long-term debt, operating lease agreements, postretirement benefit obligations, purchase obligations, interest on long-term debt and other long-term contractual obligations.

Payment of these obligations would result from settlements with taxing authorities. Due to the difficulty in determining the timing of settlements, these obligations are not included in the table above. We do not expect to make a tax payment related to these obligations within the next year that would significantly impact liquidity. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES  The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts. The more significant estimates include: residual values for leased assets, fair values for goodwill impairment tests, impairment of available-for-sale securities, warranty liability, stock-based compensation, reserves for product liability and insurance losses, postretirement benefits, post-sale discounts, credit losses and income taxes. We have incorporated many years of data into the determination of each of these estimates and we have not historically experienced significant adjustments. These assumptions are reviewed at least annually with the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors. Following are the methods and assumptions used in determining our estimates and an indication of the risks inherent in each.  Residual values for leased assets  The residual values for Cat Financials leased assets, which are an estimate of the market value of leased equipment at the end of the lease term, are based on an analysis of historical wholesale market sales prices, projected forward on a level trend line without consideration for inflation or possible future pricing action. At the inception of the lease, residual values are estimated with consideration of the following critical factors: market size and demand, any known significant market/product trends, total expected hours of usage, machine configuration, application, location, model changes, quantities, past re-marketing experience, third-party residual guarantees and contractual customer purchase options. Many of these factors are gathered in an application survey that is completed prior to quotation. The lease agreement also clearly defines applicable return conditions and remedies for non-compliance, to ensure that the leased equipment will be in good operating condition upon return. Model changes and updates, as well as market strength and product acceptance, are monitored and adjustments are made to residual values in accordance with the significance of any such changes. Remarketing sales staff works closely with customers and dealers to manage the sale of lease returns and the recovery of residual exposure. During the term of the equipment on operating leases, we evaluate our depreciation on a regular basis taking into consideration expected residual values at lease termination. Adjustments to depreciation expense reflecting revised estimates of expected residual values at the end of the lease terms are recorded prospectively on a straight-line basis. For finance leases, residual value adjustments are recognized through a reduction of finance revenue. We evaluate the carrying value of equipment on operating leases for potential impairment when we determine a triggering event has occurred. When a triggering event occurs, a test for recoverability is performed by comparing projected undiscounted future cash flows to the carrying value of the equipment on operating leases. If the test for recoverability identifies a possible impairment, the fair value of the equipment on operating leases is measured in accordance with the fair value measurement framework. An impairment charge is recognized for the amount by which the carrying value of the equipment on operating leases exceeds its estimated fair value. At December 31, 2016, the aggregate residual value of equipment on operating leases was $2.27 billion. Without consideration of other factors such as third-party residual guarantees or contractual customer purchase options, a 10% non-temporary decrease in the market value of our equipment subject to operating leases would reduce residual value estimates and result in the recognition of approximately $90 million of additional annual depreciation expense. Fair values for goodwill impairment tests  We test goodwill for impairment annually, at the reporting unit level, and whenever events or circumstances make it likely that an impairment may have occurred, such as a significant adverse change in the business climate or a decision to sell all or a portion of a reporting unit. We perform our annual goodwill impairment test as of October 1 and monitor for interim triggering events on an ongoing basis. Goodwill is reviewed for impairment utilizing either a qualitative assessment or a two-step process. If we choose to perform a qualitative assessment and determine the fair value more likely than not exceeds the carrying value, no further evaluation is necessary. For reporting units where we perform the two-step process, the first step requires us to compare the fair value of each reporting unit, which we primarily determine using an income approach based on the present value of discounted cash flows, to the respective carrying value, which includes goodwill. If the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying value, the goodwill is not considered impaired. If the carrying value is higher than the fair value, there is an indication that an impairment may exist and the second step is required. In step two, the implied fair value of goodwill is calculated as the excess of the fair value of a reporting unit over the fair values assigned to its assets and liabilities. If the implied fair value of goodwill is less than the carrying value of the reporting unit's goodwill, the difference is recognized as an impairment loss. The impairment test process requires valuation of the respective reporting unit, which we primarily determine using an income approach based on a discounted five year forecasted cash flow with a year-five residual value. The residual value is computed using the constant growth method, which values the forecasted cash flows in perpetuity. The income approach is supported by a reconciliation of our calculated fair value for Caterpillar to the company's market capitalization. The assumptions about future cash flows and growth rates are based on each reporting unit's long-term forecast and are subject to review and approval by senior management. A reporting units discount rate is a risk-adjusted weighted average cost of capital, which we believe approximates the rate from a market participant's perspective. The estimated fair value could be impacted by changes in market conditions, interest rates, growth rates, tax rates, costs, pricing and capital expenditures. The fair value determination is categorized as Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy due to its use of internal projections and unobservable measurement inputs. In 2015, our Resource Industries segment had two reporting units with goodwill: Hauling  Extraction and Material Handling  Underground. Effective January 1, 2016, product responsibility for off-highway trucks and wheel tractor scrapers transferred from Hauling  Extraction to Material Handling  Underground, and the former Hauling  Extraction reporting unit was renamed Surface Mining  Technology. As a result of the transfer in product responsibility, approximately $500 million of goodwill was reassigned from Hauling  Extraction to Material Handling  Underground based on the relative fair value of the products transferred to the total fair value of Hauling  Extraction. After the reassignment of goodwill, Surface Mining  Technology and Material Handling  Underground had goodwill of approximately $1.2 billion and $2.4 billion, respectively, as of January 1, 2016. Because the former Hauling  Extraction reporting units fair value was not substantially in excess of its carrying value as of October 1, 2015, we tested Surface Mining  Technology's goodwill for impairment as of January 1, 2016 and concluded that the fair value of the reporting unit continued to exceed its carrying value. Our annual impairment tests completed in the fourth quarter of 2016 indicated the fair value of each reporting unit was substantially above its respective carrying value, including goodwill, with the exception of our Surface Mining  Technology reporting unit. Caterpillars market capitalization has remained significantly above the net book value of the Company. The Surface Mining  Technology reporting unit, which primarily serves the mining industry, is a part of our Resource Industries segment. The goodwill assigned to this reporting unit is largely from our acquisition of Bucyrus International, Inc. in 2011. Its product portfolio includes large mining trucks, electric rope shovels, draglines, hydraulic shovels and related parts. In addition to equipment, Surface Mining  Technology also develops and sells technology products and services to provide customer fleet management, equipment management analytics and autonomous machine capabilities. The annual impairment test completed in the fourth quarter of 2016 indicated that the fair value of Surface Mining  Technology was below its carrying value requiring the second step of the goodwill impairment test process. We assigned the fair value to Surface Mining  Technologys assets and liabilities using various valuation techniques that required assumptions about royalty rates, dealer attrition, technological obsolescence and discount rates. The resulting implied fair value of goodwill was below the carrying value. Accordingly, we recognized a goodwill impairment charge of $595 million, which resulted in goodwill of $629 million remaining for Surface Mining  Technology as of October 1, 2016. There was a $17 million tax benefit associated with this impairment charge. The mining industry has experienced significant weakness for several years as a result of low commodity prices. While we continue to expect the industry will improve, we believe the pace of the improvement will be slower and cash flows and profitability will be lower than previously forecasted. We believe the slow pace of improvement will in part be due to a large amount of equipment currently idled, particularly large mining trucks, some of which will be redeployed as end-user demand increases. In addition, we do not expect a dramatic increase in commodity prices, dampening the rate of growth in mining production and demand for our products. To reflect the gradual nature of the anticipated improvement, we used a ten year cash flow forecast period for the reporting unit rather than our typical five year forecast period. In addition to Surface Mining  Technology, our Resource Industries segment has a reporting unit, Material Handling  Underground, which includes goodwill of approximately $2.4 billion as of October 1, 2016, also largely from our acquisition of Bucyrus International, Inc. in 2011. Material Handling  Undergrounds product portfolio includes large track-type tractors, hard rock vehicles, longwall miners, track and rotary drills, highwall miners, large wheel loaders, off-highway trucks, articulated trucks, wheel-tractor scrapers, wheel dozers, landfill compactors, soil compactors, material handlers, continuous miners, scoops and haulers, hardrock continuous mining systems and related parts. The fair value of Material Handling  Underground remains substantially above its carrying value. An unfavorable change in our expectations for the financial performance of our reporting units, particularly long-term growth and profitability, would reduce the fair value of our reporting units. The demand for our equipment and related parts is highly cyclical and significantly impacted by commodity prices, although the impact may vary by reporting unit. The energy and mining industries are major users of our products, including the coal, iron ore, gold, copper, oil and natural gas industries. Decisions to purchase our products are dependent upon the performance of those industries, which in turn are dependent in part on commodity prices. Lower commodity prices or industry specific circumstances that have a negative impact to the valuation assumptions may reduce the fair value of our reporting units. Should such events occur and it becomes more likely than not that a reporting unit's fair value has fallen below its carrying value, we will perform an interim goodwill impairment test(s), in addition to the annual impairment test. Future impairment tests may result in a goodwill impairment, depending on the outcome of both step one and step two of the impairment review process. A goodwill impairment would be reported as a non-cash charge to earnings.  Impairment of available-for-sale securities   Available-for-sale securities, primarily at Insurance Services, are reviewed at least quarterly to identify fair values below cost which may indicate that a security is impaired and should be written down to fair value.  For debt securities, once a securitys fair value is below cost we utilize data gathered by investment managers, external sources and internal research to monitor the performance of the security to determine whether an other-than-temporary impairment has occurred. These reviews, which include an analysis of whether it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before its anticipated recovery, consist of both quantitative and qualitative analysis and require a degree of management judgment. Securities in a loss position are monitored and assessed at least quarterly based on severity and timing of loss and may be deemed other-than-temporarily impaired at any time. Once a securitys fair value has been 20 percent or more below its original cost for six consecutive months, the security will be other-than-temporarily impaired unless there are sufficient facts and circumstances supporting otherwise.  For equity securities in a loss position, determining whether a security is other-than-temporarily impaired requires an analysis of that security's historical sector return as well as the volatility of that return. This information is utilized to estimate a securitys future fair value and to assess whether the security has the ability to recover to its original cost over a reasonable period of time. Both historical annualized sector returns and the volatility of those returns are applied over a two year period to arrive at these estimates. For both debt and equity securities, qualitative factors are also considered in determining whether a security is other-than-temporarily impaired. These include reviews of the following: significant changes in the regulatory, economic or technological environment of the investee, significant changes in the general market condition of either the geographic area or the industry in which the investee operates, and length of time and the extent to which the fair value has been less than cost. These qualitative factors are subjective and require a degree of management judgment.  Warranty liability  At the time a sale is recognized, we record estimated future warranty costs. The warranty liability is determined by applying historical claim rate experience to the current field population and dealer inventory. Generally, historical claim rates are based on actual warranty experience for each product by machine model/engine size by customer or dealer location (inside or outside North America). Specific rates are developed for each product shipment month and are updated monthly based on actual warranty claim experience. Warranty costs may differ from those estimated if actual claim rates are higher or lower than our historical rates.  Stock-based compensation  We use a lattice-based option-pricing model to calculate the fair value of our stock options and SARs. The calculation of the fair value of the awards using the lattice-based option-pricing model is affected by our stock price on the date of grant as well as assumptions regarding the following:  ##TABLE_START  Volatility is a measure of the amount by which the stock price is expected to fluctuate each year during the expected term of the award and is based on historical Caterpillar stock price movement and current implied volatilities from traded options on Caterpillar stock. The implied volatilities from traded options are impacted by changes in market conditions. An increase in the volatility would result in an increase in our expense. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  The expected term represents the period of time that awards granted are expected to be outstanding and is an output of the lattice-based option-pricing model. In determining the expected term of the award, future exercise and forfeiture patterns are estimated from Caterpillar employee historical exercise behavior. These patterns are also affected by the vesting conditions of the award. Changes in the future exercise behavior of employees or in the vesting period of the award could result in a change in the expected term. An increase in the expected term would result in an increase to our expense. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  The weighted-average dividend yield is based on Caterpillars historical dividend yields. As holders of stock options and SARs do not receive dividend payments, this could result in employees retaining the award for a longer period of time if dividend yields decrease or exercising the award sooner if dividend yields increase. A decrease in the dividend yield would result in an increase in our expense. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  The risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at time of grant. As the risk-free interest rate increases, the expected term increases, resulting in an increase in our expense. ##TABLE_END  The fair value of our RSUs and PRSUs is determined by reducing the stock price on the date of grant by the present value of the estimated dividends to be paid during the vesting period. The estimated dividends are based on Caterpillars quarterly dividend per share at the time of grant. A decrease in the dividend per share would result in an increase in our expense.  Stock-based compensation expense recognized during the period is based on the value of the number of awards that are expected to vest. In determining the stock-based compensation expense to be recognized, a forfeiture rate is applied to the fair value of the award. This rate represents the number of awards that are expected to be forfeited prior to vesting and is based on Caterpillar employee historical behavior. Changes in the future behavior of employees could impact this rate. A decrease in this rate would result in an increase in our expense. Stock-based compensation expense for PRSUs is based on the probable number of shares expected to vest. Changes in the expected probability of achieving performance targets in future periods may result in an increase or decrease in our expense.  Product liability and insurance loss reserve  We determine these reserves based upon reported claims in process of settlement and actuarial estimates for losses incurred but not reported. Loss reserves, including incurred but not reported reserves, are based on estimates and ultimate settlements may vary significantly from such estimates due to increased claims frequency or severity over historical levels.  Postretirement benefits  Primary actuarial assumptions were determined as follows: ##TABLE_START  The assumed discount rate is used to discount future benefit obligations back to todays dollars. The U.S. discount rate is based on a benefit cash flow-matching approach and represents the rate at which our benefit obligations could effectively be settled as of our measurement date, December 31. The benefit cash flow-matching approach involves analyzing Caterpillars projected cash flows against a high quality bond yield curve, calculated using a wide population of corporate Aa bonds available on the measurement date. The very highest and lowest yielding bonds (top and bottom 10 percent) are excluded from the analysis. A similar approach is used to determine the assumed discount rate for our most significant non-U.S. plans. Discount rates are sensitive to changes in interest rates. A decrease in the discount rate would increase our obligation and future expense. ##TABLE_END At December 31, 2015, we changed our method for calculating the service and interest cost components of net periodic benefit cost. Historically, these components were determined utilizing a single weighted-average discount rate based on the yield curve used to measure the benefit obligation at the beginning of the period. Beginning in 2016, we elected to utilize a full yield curve approach in the estimation of service and interest costs by applying the specific spot rates along the yield curve used in the determination of the benefit obligation to the relevant projected cash flows. We made this change to provide a more precise measurement of service and interest costs by improving the correlation between the projected cash flows to the corresponding spot rates along the yield curve. This change has no impact on our pension and other postretirement liabilities and has been accounted for prospectively as a change in accounting estimate beginning in the first quarter of 2016. ##TABLE_START  The expected long-term rate of return on plan assets is based on our estimate of long-term passive returns for equities and fixed income securities weighted by the allocation of our plan assets. Based on historical performance, we increase the passive returns due to our active management of the plan assets. This rate is impacted by changes in general market conditions, but because it represents a long-term rate, it is not significantly impacted by short-term market swings. Changes in our allocation of plan assets would also impact this rate. For example, a shift to more fixed income securities would lower the rate. A decrease in the rate would increase our expense. The expected return on plan assets is calculated using the fair value of plan assets as of our measurement date, December 31. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  The expected rate of compensation increase is used to develop benefit obligations using projected pay at retirement. It represents average long-term salary increases. This rate is influenced by our long-term compensation policies. An increase in the rate would increase our obligation and expense. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  The assumed health care trend rate represents the rate at which health care costs are assumed to increase and is based on historical and expected experience. Changes in our projections of future health care costs due to general economic conditions and those specific to health care (e.g., technology driven cost changes) will impact this trend rate. An increase in the trend rate would increase our obligation and expense. ##TABLE_END The effects of actual results differing from our assumptions and the effects of changing assumptions are considered actuarial gains or losses. We recognize actuarial gains or losses immediately through earnings upon the annual remeasurement in the fourth quarter, or on an interim basis as triggering events warrant remeasurement. See Note 12 for further information regarding the accounting for postretirement benefits.  Post-sale discount reserve  We provide discounts to dealers through merchandising programs. We have numerous programs that are designed to promote the sale of our products. The most common dealer programs provide a discount when the dealer sells a product to a targeted end user. The amount of accrued post-sale discounts was $1,288 million and $1,191 million as of December 31, 2016 and 2015 , respectively. The reserve represents discounts that we expect to pay on previously sold units and is reviewed at least quarterly. The reserve is adjusted if discounts paid differ from those estimated. Historically, those adjustments have not been material.  Credit loss reserve  The allowance for credit losses is an estimate of the losses inherent in our finance receivable portfolio and includes consideration of accounts that have been individually identified as impaired, as well as pools of finance receivables where it is probable that certain receivables in the pool are impaired but the individual accounts cannot yet be identified. In identifying and measuring impairment, management takes into consideration past loss experience, known and inherent risks in the portfolio, adverse situations that may affect the borrowers ability to repay, estimated value of underlying collateral and current economic conditions. Accounts are identified for individual review based on past-due status and information available about the customer, such as financial statements, news reports and published credit ratings, as well as general information regarding industry trends and the economic environment in which our customers operate. The allowance for credit losses attributable to finance receivables that are individually evaluated and determined to be impaired is based either on the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the receivables effective interest rate or the fair value of the collateral for collateral-dependent receivables. In determining collateral value, we estimate the current fair market value of the collateral less selling costs. We also consider credit enhancements such as additional collateral and contractual third-party guarantees. The allowance for credit losses attributable to the remaining accounts not yet individually identified as impaired is estimated based on loss forecast models utilizing probabilities of default, our estimate of the loss emergence period and the estimated loss given default. In addition, qualitative factors not able to be fully captured in our loss forecast models including industry trends, macroeconomic factors and model imprecision are considered in the evaluation of the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses. These qualitative factors are subjective and require a degree of management judgment. While management believes it has exercised prudent judgment and applied reasonable assumptions, there can be no assurance that in the future, changes in economic conditions or other factors would not cause changes in the financial health of our customers. If the financial health of our customers deteriorates, the timing and level of payments received could be impacted and therefore, could result in a change to our estimated losses. Income taxes  We are subject to the income tax laws of the many jurisdictions in which we operate. These tax laws are complex, and the manner in which they apply to our facts is sometimes open to interpretation. In establishing the provision for income taxes, we must make judgments about the application of these inherently complex tax laws. Despite our belief that our tax return positions are consistent with applicable tax laws, we believe that taxing authorities could challenge certain positions. Settlement of any challenge can result in no change, a complete disallowance, or some partial adjustment reached through negotiations or litigation. We record tax benefits for uncertain tax positions based upon managements evaluation of the information available at the reporting date. To be recognized in the financial statements, a tax benefit must be at least more likely than not of being sustained based on technical merits. The benefit for positions meeting the recognition threshold is measured as the largest benefit more likely than not of being realized upon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information. Significant judgment is required in making these determinations and adjustments to unrecognized tax benefits may be necessary to reflect actual taxes payable upon settlement. Adjustments related to positions impacting the effective tax rate affect the provision for income taxes. Adjustments related to positions impacting the timing of deductions impact deferred tax assets and liabilities. Our income tax positions and analysis are based on currently enacted tax law. Future changes in tax law could significantly impact the provision for income taxes, the amount of taxes payable, and the deferred tax asset and liability balances. Deferred tax assets generally represent tax benefits for tax deductions or credits available in future tax returns. Certain estimates and assumptions are required to determine whether it is more likely than not that all or some portion of the benefit of a deferred tax asset will not be realized. In making this assessment, management analyzes the trend of U.S. GAAP earnings and estimates the impact of future taxable income, reversing temporary differences and available prudent and feasible tax planning strategies. Should a change in facts or circumstances lead to a change in judgment about the ultimate realizability of a deferred tax asset, we record or adjust the related valuation allowance in the period that the change in facts and circumstances occurs, along with a corresponding increase or decrease in the provision for income taxes. The provision for income taxes for 2016 includes an increase in the valuation allowance for U.S. state deferred tax assets resulting in a $141 million non-cash charge, net of federal deferred tax adjustment at 35 percent. The primary driver of the increase is recent U.S. GAAP losses expected to recur in 2017 in certain state jurisdictions and the weight given this negative objective evidence under income tax accounting guidance. Reversal of the valuation allowance in the future is dependent on U.S. GAAP profitability in these state jurisdictions giving less weight in the analysis to mark-to-market adjustments to remeasure our pension and OPEB plans as we do not consider these adjustments indicative of ongoing earnings trends. A provision for U.S. income taxes has not been recorded on undistributed profits of our non-U.S. subsidiaries that we have determined to be indefinitely reinvested outside the U.S. If management intentions or U.S. tax law changes in the future, there could be a significant negative impact on the provision for income taxes to record an incremental tax liability in the period the change occurs. A deferred tax asset is recognized only if we have definite plans to generate a U.S. tax benefit by repatriating earnings in the foreseeable future. Income taxes are based on the statutory tax rate of the jurisdiction in which earnings are subject to taxation. That statutory rate may differ from the statutory tax rate of the jurisdiction in which that entity is incorporated. Taxes are paid in the jurisdictions where earnings are subject to taxation. The effective tax rate differs from the U.S. statutory rate in part due to indefinitely reinvested profits of non-U.S. subsidiaries being subject to statutory tax rates which are generally lower than the U.S. rate of 35 percent. The indefinitely reinvested profits of Caterpillar SARL (CSARL), primarily taxable in Switzerland, contribute the most significant amount of this difference. For tax years 2007 to 2012 including the impact of a loss carryback to 2005, the IRS has proposed to tax in the United States profits earned from certain parts transactions by CSARL based on the IRS examination teams application of substance-over-form or assignment-of-income judicial doctrines. We are vigorously contesting the proposed increases to tax and penalties for these years of approximately $2 billion. We believe that the relevant transactions complied with applicable tax laws and did not violate judicial doctrines. The purchase of parts by CSARL from unrelated parties and the subsequent sale of those parts to unrelated dealers outside the United States have substantial legal, commercial, and economic consequences for the parties involved. We have filed U.S. income tax returns on this same basis for years after 2012. We currently believe the ultimate disposition of this matter will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position, liquidity or results of operations. OTHER MATTERS  ENVIRONMENTAL AND LEGAL MATTERS The Company is regulated by federal, state and international environmental laws governing our use, transport and disposal of substances and control of emissions. In addition to governing our manufacturing and other operations, these laws often impact the development of our products, including, but not limited to, required compliance with air emissions standards applicable to internal combustion engines. We have made, and will continue to make, significant research and development and capital expenditures to comply with these emissions standards. We are engaged in remedial activities at a number of locations, often with other companies, pursuant to federal and state laws. When it is probable we will pay remedial costs at a site, and those costs can be reasonably estimated, the investigation, remediation, and operating and maintenance costs are accrued against our earnings. Costs are accrued based on consideration of currently available data and information with respect to each individual site, including available technologies, current applicable laws and regulations, and prior remediation experience. Where no amount within a range of estimates is more likely, we accrue the minimum. Where multiple potentially responsible parties are involved, we consider our proportionate share of the probable costs. In formulating the estimate of probable costs, we do not consider amounts expected to be recovered from insurance companies or others. We reassess these accrued amounts on a quarterly basis. The amount recorded for environmental remediation is not material and is included in Accrued expenses. We believe there is no more than a remote chance that a material amount for remedial activities at any individual site, or at all the sites in the aggregate, will be required. On January 8, 2015, the Company received a grand jury subpoena from the U.S. District Court for the Central District of Illinois. The subpoena requests documents and information from the Company relating to, among other things, financial information concerning U.S. and non-U.S. Caterpillar subsidiaries (including undistributed profits of non-U.S. subsidiaries and the movement of cash among U.S. and non-U.S. subsidiaries). The Company has received additional subpoenas relating to this investigation requesting additional documents and information relating to, among other things, the purchase and resale of replacement parts by Caterpillar Inc. and non-U.S. Caterpillar subsidiaries, dividend distributions of certain non-U.S. Caterpillar subsidiaries, and Caterpillar SARL and related structures. The Company is cooperating with this investigation. The Company is unable to predict the outcome or reasonably estimate any potential loss; however, we currently believe that this matter will not have a material adverse effect on the Companys consolidated results of operations, financial position or liquidity. On September 10, 2014, the SEC issued to Caterpillar a subpoena seeking information concerning the Companys accounting for the goodwill relating to its acquisition of Bucyrus International Inc. in 2011 and related matters. The Company has received additional subpoenas relating to this investigation, and the Company is cooperating with the SEC regarding its ongoing investigation. The Company is unable to predict the outcome or reasonably estimate any potential loss; however, we currently believe that this matter will not have a material adverse effect on the Company's consolidated results of operations, financial position or liquidity. On March 20, 2014, Brazils Administrative Council for Economic Defense (CADE) published a Technical Opinion which named 18 companies and over 100 individuals as defendants, including two subsidiaries of Caterpillar Inc., MGE - Equipamentos e Servios Ferrovirios Ltda. (MGE) and Caterpillar Brasil Ltda. The publication of the Technical Opinion opened CADE's official administrative investigation into allegations that the defendants participated in anticompetitive bid activity for the construction and maintenance of metro and train networks in Brazil. While companies cannot be held criminally liable for anticompetitive conduct in Brazil, criminal charges have been brought against two current employees of MGE and one former employee of MGE involving the same conduct alleged by CADE. The Company has responded to all requests for information from the authorities. The Company is unable to predict the outcome or reasonably estimate the potential loss; however, we currently believe that this matter will not have a material adverse effect on the Company's consolidated results of operations, financial position or liquidity. On October 24, 2013, Progress Rail received a grand jury subpoena from the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California. The subpoena requests documents and information from Progress Rail, United Industries Corporation, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Progress Rail, and Caterpillar Inc. relating to allegations that Progress Rail conducted improper or unnecessary railcar inspections and repairs and improperly disposed of parts, equipment, tools and other items. In connection with this subpoena, Progress Rail was informed by the U.S. Attorney for the Central District of California that it is a target of a criminal investigation into potential violations of environmental laws and alleged improper business practices. The Company is cooperating with the authorities and is currently in discussions regarding a potential resolution of the matter. Although the Company believes a loss is probable, we currently believe that this matter will not have a material adverse effect on the Company's consolidated results of operations, financial position or liquidity. In addition, we are involved in other unresolved legal actions that arise in the normal course of business. The most prevalent of these unresolved actions involve disputes related to product design, manufacture and performance liability (including claimed asbestos and welding fumes exposure), contracts, employment issues, environmental matters or intellectual property rights. The aggregate range of reasonably possible losses in excess of accrued liabilities, if any, associated with these unresolved legal actions is not material. In some cases, we cannot reasonably estimate a range of loss because there is insufficient information regarding the matter. However, we believe there is no more than a remote chance that any liability arising from these matters would be material. Although it is not possible to predict with certainty the outcome of these unresolved legal actions, we believe that these actions will not individually or in the aggregate have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations, financial position or liquidity.  RETIREMENT BENEFITS We recognize mark-to-market gains and losses immediately through earnings upon the remeasurement of our pension and OPEB plans. Mark-to-market gains and losses represent the effects of actual results differing from our assumptions and the effects of changing assumptions. Changes in discount rates and differences between the actual return on plan assets and the expected return on plan assets generally have the largest impact on mark-to-market gains and losses. We recognized expense of $957 million in 2016, expense of $292 million in 2015 and expense of $2.71 billion in 2014 related to our defined benefit pension and OPEB plans. The increase in expense in 2016 compared to 2015 was primarily due to a higher net mark-to-market loss in 2016 compared to 2015 and lower expected return on plan assets as a result of a lower asset base in 2016 compared to 2015 and a lower expected rate of return on plan assets. This was partially offset by lower interest costs primarily due to adoption of a full yield curve approach in the estimation of interest cost (discussed below) and lower service costs primarily due to fewer employees earning benefits under our plans as a result of the U.S. voluntary retirement enhancement program that was implemented in the fourth quarter 2015. The decrease in expense in 2015 compared to 2014 was primarily due to a lower net mark-to-market loss in 2015 compared to 2014. The primary factors that resulted in mark-to-market losses for 2016, 2015 and 2014 are described below: ##TABLE_START  2016 net mark-to-market loss of $985 million - Primarily due to lower discount rates at the end of 2016 compared to the end of 2015 and changes in our U.S. mortality assumption (discussed below). This was partially offset by the difference between the actual return on plan assets compared to the expected return on plan assets (U.S. pension plans had an actual rate of return of 7.8 percent compared to an expected rate of return of 6.9 percent). ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  2015 net mark-to-market loss of $179 million - Primarily due to the difference between the actual return on plan assets compared to the expected return on plan assets (U.S. pension plans had an actual rate of return of (2.0) percent compared to an expected rate of return of 7.4 percent) which was partially offset by higher discount rates at the end of 2015 compared to 2014. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  2014 net mark-to-market loss of $2.62 billion - Primarily due to lower discount rates at the end of 2014 compared to the end of 2013 and changes to our U.S. mortality assumption (discussed below). ##TABLE_END The net mark-to-market losses were in the following Results of Operations line items: ##TABLE_START   Years ended December 31, (Millions of dollars)           Cost of goods sold  $  $  $ 1,233 Selling, general and administrative expenses    1,078 Research and development expenses    Total  $  $  $ 2,624        ##TABLE_ENDIn the fourth quarter of 2014, the mortality assumption for our U.S. pension and OPEB plans was reviewed to consider the use of new tables that were released by the Society of Actuaries (SoA). As of December 31, 2014, the company adopted the new tables with modifications to reflect historical company specific mortality experience and its best estimate of future mortality improvements. The adoption of the new tables resulted in an increase in the life expectancy of plan participants and therefore an increase in our Liability for postemployment benefits of approximately $400 million. In the fourth quarter of 2016, the mortality assumption for our U.S. pension and OPEB plans was reviewed to consider the use of new mortality improvement projection scales that were released by the SoA. As of December 31, 2016, the company adopted the new mortality improvement projection scales which resulted in an increase in the life expectancy of plan participants and therefore an increase in our Liability for postemployment benefits of approximately $200 million. At December 31, 2015, we changed our method for calculating the service and interest cost components of net periodic benefit cost. Historically, these components were determined utilizing a single weighted-average discount rate based on a yield curve used to measure the benefit obligation at the beginning of the period. Beginning in 2016, we elected to utilize a full yield curve approach in the estimation of service and interest costs by applying the specific spot rates along the yield curve used in the determination of the benefit obligation to the relevant projected cash flows. We made this change to provide a more precise measurement of service and interest costs by improving the correlation between the projected cash flows to the corresponding spot rates along the yield curve. Under the previous method the discount rate used for the service and interest components of cost would have been 4.2 percent for U.S. pensions, 3.2 percent for non-U.S. pension and 4.1 percent for OPEB. This change had no impact on our year-end defined benefit pension and OPEB obligations or our annual net periodic benefit cost as the lower service and interest costs were entirely offset in the actuarial loss (gain) reported. Compared to the method used in 2015, this change lowered service and interest costs by $180 million. We expect our total defined benefit pension and OPEB expense (excluding the impact of mark-to-market gains and losses) to increase approximately $50 million in 2017. In general, our strategy for both the U.S. and the non-U.S. pensions includes ongoing alignment of our investments to our liabilities, while reducing risk in our portfolio. For our U.S. pension plans, our year-end 2016 asset allocation was 41 percent equity securities, 56 percent fixed income securities and 3 percent other. Our current U.S. pension target asset allocations is 40 percent equity and 60 percent fixed income. The target allocations will be revisited periodically to reflect our overall objectives. The U.S. plans are rebalanced to plus or minus 5 percentage points of the target asset allocation ranges on a monthly basis. The year-end 2016 asset allocation for our non-U.S. pension plans was 38 percent equity securities, 55 percent fixed income securities, 5 percent real estate and 2 percent other. The 2016 target allocation for our non-U.S. pension plans was 39 percent equity securities, 52 percent fixed income securities, 6 percent real estate and 3 percent other. The target allocations for each plan vary based upon local statutory requirements, demographics of the plan participants and funded status. The frequency of rebalancing for the non-U.S. plans varies depending on the plan. Contributions to our pension and OPEB plans were $329 million and $350 million in 2016 and 2015, respectively. We expect to make approximately $610 million of contributions to our pension and OPEB plans in 2017. We believe we have adequate resources to fund both pension and OPEB plans. Actuarial assumptions have a significant impact on both pension and OPEB expenses. The effects of a one percentage point change in our primary actuarial assumptions on 2016 benefit costs and year-end obligations are included in the table below. ##TABLE_START      ##TABLE_ENDPostretirement Benefit Plan Actuarial Assumptions Sensitivity  Following are the effects of a one percentage-point change in our primary pension and OPEB actuarial assumptions (included in the following table) on 2016 pension and other OPEB costs and obligations:  ##TABLE_START   2016 Benefit Cost  Year-end Benefit Obligation (Millions of dollars)  One percentage- point increase  One percentage- point decrease  One percentage- point increase  One percentage- point decrease Pension benefits:         Assumed discount rate  $  $ (71 )  $ (2,328 )  $ 2,864 Expected rate of compensation increase   (13 )   (98 ) Expected long-term rate of return on plan assets  (147 )      Other postretirement benefits:         Assumed discount rate   (13 )  (372 )  Expected rate of compensation increase       (1 ) Expected long-term rate of return on plan assets  (6 )      Assumed health care cost trend rate   (15 )   (150 )          ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START Primary Actuarial Assumptions                      U.S. Pension Benefits  Non-U.S. Pension Benefits  Other Postretirement Benefits           Weighted-average assumptions used to determine benefit obligations, end of year:                   Discount rate  4.0 %  4.2 %  3.8 %  2.5 %  3.2 %  3.3 %  4.0 %  4.1 %  3.9 % Rate of compensation increase  4.0 %  4.0 %  4.0 %  4.0 %  3.8 %  4.0 %  4.0 %  4.0 %  4.0 %                    Weighted-average assumptions used to determine net cost:                   Discount rate used to measure service cost  4.5 %  3.8 %  4.6 %  2.9 %  3.3 %  4.1 %  4.2 %  3.9 %  4.6 % Discount rate used to measure interest cost  3.4 %  3.8 %  4.6 %  2.8 %  3.3 %  4.1 %  3.3 %  3.9 %  4.6 % Expected rate of return on plan assets  6.9 %  7.4 %  7.8 %  6.1 %  6.8 %  6.9 %  7.5 %  7.8 %  7.8 % Rate of compensation increase  4.0 %  4.0 %  4.0 %  3.6 %  4.0 %  4.2 %  4.0 %  4.0 %  4.0 %                    Health care cost trend rates at year-end:                   Health care trend rate assumed for next year  6.6 %  6.5 %  6.6 % Rate that the cost trend rate gradually declines to  5.0 %  5.0 %  5.0 % Year that the cost trend rate reaches ultimate rate                       ##TABLE_ENDSENSITIVITY  Foreign Exchange Rate Sensitivity  Machinery, Energy  Transportation operations use foreign currency forward and option contracts to manage unmatched foreign currency cash inflow and outflow. Our objective is to minimize the risk of exchange rate movements that would reduce the U.S. dollar value of our foreign currency cash flow. Our policy allows for managing anticipated foreign currency cash flow for up to five years. Based on the anticipated and firmly committed cash inflow and outflow for our Machinery, Energy  Transportation operations for the next 12 months and the foreign currency derivative instruments in place at year-end, a hypothetical 10 percent weakening of the U.S. dollar relative to all other currencies would adversely affect our expected 2017 cash flow for our Machinery, Energy  Transportation operations by approximately $143 million. Last year similar assumptions and calculations yielded a potential $318 million adverse impact on 2016 cash flow. We determine our net exposures by calculating the difference in cash inflow and outflow by currency and adding or subtracting outstanding foreign currency derivative instruments. We multiply these net amounts by 10 percent to determine the sensitivity.  Since our policy for Financial Products operations is to hedge the foreign exchange risk when the currency of our debt portfolio does not match the currency of our receivable portfolio, a 10 percent change in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to all other currencies would not have a material effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flow. Neither our policy nor the effect of a 10 percent change in the value of the U.S. dollar has changed from that reported at the end of last year. The effect of the hypothetical change in exchange rates ignores the effect this movement may have on other variables, including competitive risk. If it were possible to quantify this competitive impact, the results would probably be different from the sensitivity effects shown above. In addition, it is unlikely that all currencies would uniformly strengthen or weaken relative to the U.S. dollar. In reality, some currencies may weaken while others may strengthen. Our primary exposure (excluding competitive risk) is to exchange rate movements in the Japanese yen, euro, Chinese yuan, British pound and Australian dollar.  Interest Rate Sensitivity  For our Machinery, Energy  Transportation operations, we have the option to use interest rate swaps to lower the cost of borrowed funds by attaching fixed-to-floating interest rate swaps to fixed-rate debt, and by entering into forward rate agreements on future debt issuances. A hypothetical 100 basis point adverse move in interest rates along the entire interest rate yield curve would have a minimal impact to the 2017 pre-tax earnings of Machinery, Energy  Transportation. Last year, similar assumptions and calculations yielded a minimal impact to 2016 pre-tax earnings.  For our Financial Products operations, we use interest rate derivative instruments primarily to meet our match-funding objectives and strategies. We have a match-funding policy whereby the interest rate profile (fixed or floating rate) of our debt portfolio is matched to the interest rate profile of our earning asset portfolio (finance receivables and operating leases) within certain parameters. In connection with that policy, we use interest rate swap agreements to modify the debt structure. Match funding assists us in maintaining our interest rate spreads, regardless of the direction interest rates move.  In order to properly manage sensitivity to changes in interest rates, Financial Products measures the potential impact of different interest rate assumptions on pre-tax earnings. All on-balance sheet positions, including derivative financial instruments, are included in the analysis. The primary assumptions included in the analysis are that there are no new fixed rate assets or liabilities, the proportion of fixed rate debt to fixed rate assets remains unchanged and the level of floating rate assets and debt remain constant. An analysis of the December 31, 2016 balance sheet, using these assumptions, estimates the impact of a 100 basis point immediate and sustained adverse change in interest rates to have a potential $6 million adverse impact on 2017 pre-tax earnings. Last year, similar assumptions and calculations yielded a potential $13 million adverse impact to 2016 pre-tax earnings.  This analysis does not necessarily represent our current outlook of future market interest rate movement, nor does it consider any actions management could undertake in response to changes in interest rates. Accordingly, no assurance can be given that actual results would be consistent with the results of our estimate. NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES The following definitions are provided for the non-GAAP financial measures used in this report. These non-GAAP financial measures have no standardized meaning prescribed by U.S. GAAP and therefore are unlikely to be comparable to the calculation of similar measures for other companies. Management does not intend these items to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the related GAAP measures. We believe it is important to separately quantify the profit impact of several special items in order for our results to be meaningful to our readers. These items consist of (i) restructuring costs, which are incurred in the current year to generate longer term benefits, (ii) pension and OPEB mark-to-market losses resulting from plan remeasurements, (iii) goodwill impairment charges and (iv) state deferred tax valuation allowances. We do not consider these items indicative of earnings from ongoing business activities and believe the non-GAAP measure will provide useful perspective on underlying business results and trends, and a means to assess our period-over-period results. Reconciliations of adjusted profit before taxes to the most directly comparable GAAP measure, consolidated profit before taxes, are as follows: ##TABLE_START   Three Months Ended December 31,  Twelve Months Ended December 31, (millions of dollars)     Profit (Loss) before taxes  $ (1,348 )  $ (247 )  $  $ 3,439 Restructuring costs  $  $  $ 1,019  $ Mark-to-market losses  $  $  $  $ Goodwill impairment  $  $   $  $  Adjusted profit before taxes  $  $  $ 2,738  $ 4,516          ##TABLE_ENDReconciliations of adjusted profit per share to the most directly comparable GAAP measure, diluted profit per share, are as follows: ##TABLE_START   Three Months Ended December 31,  Twelve Months Ended December 31,      Profit (Loss) per share - diluted  $ (2.00 )  $ (0.16 )  $ (0.11 )  $ 4.18 Per share restructuring costs 1  $ 0.45  $ 0.76  $ 1.16  $ 0.98 Per share mark-to-market losses 1  $ 1.14  $ 0.23  $ 1.15  $ 0.19 Per share goodwill impairment 2  $ 0.98  $   $ 0.98  $  Per share state deferred tax valuation allowance  $ 0.24  $   $ 0.24  $  Adjusted profit per share  $ 0.83  $ 0.83  $ 3.42  $ 5.35          1 At statutory tax rates.         2 Includes a $17 million tax benefit.

(company) is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act. Our internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of our financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Our internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.  Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.  Management assessed the effectiveness of the companys internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2016 . In making this assessment, we used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework (2013). Based on our assessment we concluded that, as of December 31, 2016 , the companys internal control over financial reporting was effective based on those criteria.  The effectiveness of the companys internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2016 has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm. Their report appears on page 69.   ##TABLE_START  /s/ D. James Umpleby III   D. James Umpleby III   Chief Executive Officer           /s/ Bradley M. Halverson   Bradley M. Halverson   Group President   and Chief Financial Officer         February 15, 2017  ##TABLE_ENDREPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of Caterpillar Inc.: In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated statement of financial position and the related consolidated statements of results of operations, comprehensive income, changes in stockholders equity, and of cash flow, including pages 70 through 155, present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Caterpillar Inc. and its subsidiaries  at  December 31, 2016 and 2015, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2016  in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2016, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013)  issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). The Company's management is responsible for these financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in Management's Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting appearing on page 68. Our responsibility is to express opinions on these financial statements and on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our integrated audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audits of the financial statements included examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions. As described in Note 1.B. to the consolidated financial statements, the Company changed the manner in which it accounts for pension and other postretirement benefit plans in 2016. As described in Note 1.K. to the consolidated financial statements, the Company changed its method of classifying deferred income taxes in the consolidated statement of financial position in 2016. A companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. /s/ PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP Peoria, Illinois February 15, 2017 ##TABLE_START STATEMENT 1 Caterpillar Inc.

Operations and summary of significant accounting policies ##TABLE_END  ##TABLE_START A. Nature of operations ##TABLE_END  Information in our financial statements and related commentary are presented in the following categories:  Machinery, Energy  Transportation  Represents the aggregate total of Construction Industries, Resource Industries, Energy  Transportation and All Other operating segments and related corporate items and eliminations.  Financial Products  Primarily includes the companys Financial Products Segment. This category includes Caterpillar Financial Services Corporation (Cat Financial), Caterpillar Financial Insurance Services (Insurance Services) and their respective subsidiaries.  Our products are sold primarily under the brands Caterpillar, CAT, design versions of CAT and Caterpillar, \"EMD,\" FG Wilson, MaK, MWM, Perkins, Progress Rail, SEM and Solar Turbines.  We conduct operations in our Machinery, Energy  Transportation lines of business under highly competitive conditions, including intense price competition. We place great emphasis on the high quality and performance of our products and our dealers service support. Although no one competitor is believed to produce all of the same types of equipment that we do, there are numerous companies, large and small, which compete with us in the sale of each of our products.  Our machines are distributed principally through a worldwide organization of dealers (dealer network), 49 located in the United States and 123 located outside the United States, serving 190 countries. Reciprocating engines are sold principally through the dealer network and to other manufacturers for use in products. Some of the reciprocating engines manufactured by our subsidiary Perkins Engines Company Limited, are also sold through its worldwide network of 96 distributors covering 179 countries. The FG Wilson branded electric power generation systems manufactured by our subsidiary Caterpillar Northern Ireland Limited are sold through its worldwide network of 184 distributors covering 145 countries. Some of the large, medium speed reciprocating engines are also sold under the MaK brand through a worldwide network of 20 distributors covering 130 countries. Our dealers do not deal exclusively with our products; however, in most cases sales and servicing of our products are the dealers principal business. Some products, primarily turbines and locomotives, are sold directly to end customers through sales forces employed by the company. At times, these employees are assisted by independent sales representatives.  The Financial Products line of business also conducts operations under highly competitive conditions. Financing for users of Caterpillar products is available through a variety of competitive sources, principally commercial banks and finance and leasing companies. We offer various financing plans designed to increase the opportunity for sales of our products and generate financing income for our company. A significant portion of Financial Products activity is conducted in North America, with additional offices in Latin America, Europe and Asia/Pacific. ##TABLE_START B. Basis of presentation and change in accounting principle ##TABLE_END  The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Caterpillar Inc. and its subsidiaries where we have a controlling financial interest. Investments in companies where our ownership exceeds 20 percent and we do not have a controlling interest or where the ownership is less than 20 percent and for which we have a significant influence are accounted for by the equity method. See Note 9 for further discussion. We consolidate all variable interest entities (VIEs) where Caterpillar Inc. is the primary beneficiary. For VIEs, we assess whether we are the primary beneficiary as prescribed by the accounting guidance on the consolidation of VIEs. The primary beneficiary of a VIE is the party that has both the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the entitys economic performance and the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits that could potentially be significant to the VIE. See Note 21 for further discussion on a consolidated VIE. We have affiliates, suppliers and dealers that are VIEs of which we are not the primary beneficiary. Although we have provided financial support, we do not have the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the economic performance of each entity. Our maximum exposure to loss from VIEs for which we are not the primary beneficiary was as follows: ##TABLE_START   December 31, (Millions of dollars)    Receivables - trade and other  $  $  Receivables - finance    Long-term receivables - finance    Investments in unconsolidated affiliated companies    Guarantees    Total  $  $        ##TABLE_ENDIn addition, Cat Financial has end-user customers that are VIEs of which we are not the primary beneficiary. Although we have provided financial support to these entities and therefore have a variable interest, we do not have the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact their economic performance. Our maximum exposure to loss from our involvement with these VIEs is limited to the credit risk inherently present in the financial support that we have provided. These risks are evaluated and reflected in our financial statements as part of our overall portfolio of finance receivables and related allowance for credit losses. Shipping and handling costs are included in Cost of goods sold in Statement 1. Other operating (income) expenses primarily include Cat Financials depreciation of equipment leased to others, Insurance Services underwriting expenses, gains (losses) on disposal of long-lived assets, long-lived asset impairment charges, legal settlements and accruals, employee separation charges and benefit plan curtailment gains (losses).  Prepaid expenses and other current assets in Statement 3 include prepaid rent, prepaid insurance, prepaid and refundable income tax, assets held for sale, core to be returned for remanufacturing, restricted cash and other short-term investments, and other prepaid items. Certain amounts for prior years have been reclassified to conform with the current-year financial statement presentation.  Change in Accounting Principle Effective January 1, 2016, we changed our accounting principle for recognizing actuarial gains and losses and expected returns on plan assets for our defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans. Prior to 2016, actuarial gains and losses were recognized as a component of Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) and were generally amortized into earnings in future periods. Under the new principle, actuarial gains and losses are immediately recognized through net benefit cost upon the annual remeasurement in the fourth quarter, or on an interim basis as triggering events warrant remeasurement. In addition, we have changed our policy for recognizing the expected returns on plan assets from a market-related value method (based on a three-year smoothing of asset returns) to a fair value method. We believe these changes are preferable as they accelerate the recognition of changes in fair value of plan assets and actuarial gains and losses in our Consolidated Statement of Results of Operations, provide greater transparency of our economic obligations in accounting results and better align with the fair value principles by recognizing the effects of economic and interest rate changes on pension and other postretirement benefit assets and liabilities in the year in which the gains and losses are incurred. These changes have been applied retrospectively to prior years. As of January 1, 2014, the cumulative effect of the change resulted in a decrease of $4.1 billion in Profit employed in the business and a corresponding increase of $4.1 billion in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), both net of tax of $2.4 billion . Following are the impacts to financial statement line items as a result of the change in accounting principle for the periods presented in the accompanying consolidated financial statements:

##TABLE_ENDThe above tables include changes resulting from reclassifications between financial statement line items. ##TABLE_START C. Sales and revenue recognition ##TABLE_END  Sales of Machinery, Energy  Transportation are recognized and earned when all the following criteria are satisfied: (a) persuasive evidence of a sales arrangement exists; (b) price is fixed and determinable; (c) collectibility is reasonably assured; and (d) delivery has occurred. Persuasive evidence of an arrangement and a fixed or determinable price exist once we receive an order or contract from a customer or independently owned and operated dealer. We assess collectibility at the time of the sale and if collectibility is not reasonably assured, the sale is deferred and not recognized until collectibility is probable or payment is received. Typically, where product is produced and sold in the same country, title and risk of ownership transfer when the product is shipped. Products that are exported from a country for sale typically pass title and risk of ownership at the border of the destination country.  Sales of certain turbine machinery units, draglines and long wall roof supports are recognized under accounting for construction-type contracts, primarily using the percentage-of-completion method. Revenue is recognized based upon progress towards completion, which is estimated and continually updated over the course of construction. We provide for any loss that we expect to incur on these contracts when that loss is probable.  Our remanufacturing operations are primarily focused on the remanufacture of Cat engines and components and rail related products. In this business, used engines and related components (core) are inspected, cleaned and remanufactured. In connection with the sale of most of our remanufactured product, we collect a deposit from the dealer that is repaid if the dealer returns an acceptable core within a specified time period. Caterpillar owns and has title to the cores when they are returned from dealers. The rebuilt engine or component (the core plus any new content) is then sold as a remanufactured product to dealers and customers. Revenue is recognized pursuant to the same criteria as Machinery, Energy  Transportation sales noted above (title to the entire remanufactured product passes to the dealer upon sale). At the time of sale, the deposit is recognized in Other current liabilities in Statement 3. In addition, the core to be returned is recognized as an asset in Prepaid expenses and other current assets in Statement 3 at the estimated replacement cost (based on historical experience with useable cores). Upon receipt of an acceptable core, we repay the deposit and relieve the liability. The returned core is then included in inventory. In the event that the deposit is forfeited (i.e. upon failure by the dealer to return an acceptable core in the specified time period), we recognize the core deposit and the cost of the core in Sales and Cost of goods sold, respectively.  No right of return exists on sales of equipment. Replacement part returns are estimable and accrued at the time a sale is recognized.  We provide discounts to dealers through merchandising programs. We have numerous programs that are designed to promote the sale of our products. The most common dealer programs provide a discount when the dealer sells a product to a targeted end user. The cost of these discounts is estimated based on historical experience and known changes in merchandising programs and is reported as a reduction to sales when the product sale is recognized.  Our standard dealer invoice terms are established by marketing region. Our invoice terms for end-user customer sales are established by the responsible business unit. When a sale is made to a dealer, the dealer is responsible for payment even if the product is not sold to an end customer. Dealers and customers must make payment within the established invoice terms to avoid potential interest costs. Interest at or above prevailing market rates may be charged on any past due balance, and generally our practice is to not forgive this interest. In 2016 , 2015 and 2014 terms were extended to not more than one year for $406 million , $635 million and $624 million of receivables, respectively, which represent approximately 1 percent of consolidated sales. We establish a bad debt allowance for Machinery, Energy  Transportation receivables when it becomes probable that the receivable will not be collected. Our allowance for bad debts is not significant. Revenues of Financial Products are generated primarily from finance revenue on finance receivables and rental payments on operating leases. Finance revenue is recorded over the life of the related finance receivable using the interest method, including the accretion of certain direct origination costs that are deferred. Revenue from rental payments received on operating leases is recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease. Recognition of finance revenue and rental revenue is suspended and the account is placed on non-accrual status when management determines that collection of future income is not probable (generally after 120 days past due). Recognition is resumed, and previously suspended income is recognized, when the account becomes current and collection of remaining amounts is considered probable. See Note 6 for more information.  Sales and revenues are presented net of sales and other related taxes.  ##TABLE_START D. Inventories ##TABLE_END  Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market. Cost is principally determined using the last-in, first-out (LIFO) method. The value of inventories on the LIFO basis represented about 60 percent of total inventories at December 31, 2016 and 2015 .  If the FIFO (first-in, first-out) method had been in use, inventories would have been $2,139 million and $2,498 million higher than reported at December 31, 2016 and 2015 , respectively. ##TABLE_START E. Depreciation and amortization ##TABLE_END  Depreciation of plant and equipment is computed principally using accelerated methods. Depreciation on equipment leased to others, primarily for Financial Products, is computed using the straight-line method over the term of the lease. The depreciable basis is the original cost of the equipment less the estimated residual value of the equipment at the end of the lease term. In 2016 , 2015 and 2014 , Cat Financial depreciation on equipment leased to others was $841 million , $836 million and $872 million , respectively, and was included in Other operating (income) expenses in Statement 1. In 2016 , 2015 and 2014 , consolidated depreciation expense was $2,707 million , $2,705 million and $2,795 million , respectively. Amortization of purchased finite-lived intangibles is computed principally using the straight-line method, generally not to exceed a period of 20 years .  ##TABLE_START F. Foreign currency translation ##TABLE_END  The functional currency for most of our Machinery, Energy  Transportation consolidated companies is the U.S. dollar. The functional currency for most of our Financial Products and affiliates accounted for under the equity method is the respective local currency. Gains and losses resulting from the remeasurement of foreign currency amounts to the functional currency are included in Other income (expense) in Statement 1. Gains and losses resulting from translating assets and liabilities from the functional currency to U.S. dollars are included in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in Statement 3.  ##TABLE_START G. Derivative financial instruments ##TABLE_END  Our earnings and cash flow are subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates and commodity prices. Our Risk Management Policy (policy) allows for the use of derivative financial instruments to prudently manage foreign currency exchange rate, interest rate and commodity price exposures. Our policy specifies that derivatives are not to be used for speculative purposes. Derivatives that we use are primarily foreign currency forward, option, and cross currency contracts, interest rate swaps, and commodity forward and option contracts. All derivatives are recorded at fair value. See Note 3 for more information. ##TABLE_START H. Income taxes ##TABLE_END  The provision for income taxes is determined using the asset and liability approach taking into account guidance related to uncertain tax positions. Tax laws require items to be included in tax filings at different times than the items are reflected in the financial statements. A current liability is recognized for the estimated taxes payable for the current year. Deferred taxes represent the future tax consequences expected to occur when the reported amounts of assets and liabilities are recovered or paid. Deferred taxes are adjusted for enacted changes in tax rates and tax laws. Valuation allowances are recorded to reduce deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will not be realized. ##TABLE_START I. Goodwill ##TABLE_END  For acquisitions accounted for as a business combination, goodwill represents the excess of the cost over the fair value of the net assets acquired. We are required to test goodwill for impairment, at the reporting unit level, annually and when events or circumstances indicate the fair value of a reporting unit may be below its carrying value. A reporting unit is an operating segment or one level below an operating segment (referred to as a component) to which goodwill is assigned when initially recorded. We assign goodwill to reporting units based on our integration plans and the expected synergies resulting from the acquisition. Because Caterpillar is a highly integrated company, the businesses we acquire are sometimes combined with or integrated into existing reporting units. When changes occur in the composition of our operating segments or reporting units, goodwill is reassigned to the affected reporting units based on their relative fair values. We test goodwill for impairment annually and whenever events or circumstances make it more likely than not that an impairment may have occurred. We perform our annual goodwill impairment test as of October 1 and monitor for interim triggering events on an ongoing basis. Goodwill is reviewed for impairment utilizing either a qualitative assessment or a two-step process. We have an option to make a qualitative assessment of a reporting units goodwill for impairment. If we choose to perform a qualitative assessment and determine the fair value more likely than not exceeds the carrying value, no further evaluation is necessary. For reporting units where we perform the two-step process, the first step requires us to compare the fair value of each reporting unit, which we primarily determine using an income approach based on the present value of discounted cash flows, to the respective carrying value, which includes goodwill. If the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying value, the goodwill is not considered impaired. If the carrying value is higher than the fair value, there is an indication that an impairment may exist and the second step is required. In step two, the implied fair value of goodwill is calculated as the excess of the fair value of a reporting unit over the fair values assigned to its assets and liabilities. If the implied fair value of goodwill is less than the carrying value of the reporting units goodwill, the difference is recognized as an impairment loss. See Note 10 for further details. ##TABLE_START J. Estimates in financial statements ##TABLE_END  The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts. The more significant estimates include: residual values for leased assets, fair values for goodwill impairment tests, impairment of available-for-sale securities, warranty liability, stock-based compensation and reserves for product liability and insurance losses, postretirement benefits, post-sale discounts, credit losses and income taxes. ##TABLE_START K. New accounting guidance ##TABLE_END  Revenue recognition - In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued new revenue recognition guidance to provide a single, comprehensive revenue recognition model for all contracts with customers. Under the new guidance, an entity will recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers at an amount that the entity expects to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services. A five step model has been introduced for an entity to apply when recognizing revenue. The new guidance also includes enhanced disclosure requirements, and is effective January 1, 2018, with early adoption permitted for January 1, 2017. Entities have the option to apply the new guidance under a retrospective approach to each prior reporting period presented, or a modified retrospective approach with the cumulative effect of initially applying the new guidance recognized at the date of initial application within the Consolidated Statement of Changes in Stockholders' Equity. We plan to adopt the new guidance effective January 1, 2018. We have made substantial progress in our evaluation of the impact of the new standard. Under the new guidance, we anticipate sales of certain turbine machinery units will change to a point-in-time recognition model. Under current guidance, we account for these sales under an over-time model following the percentage-of-completion method as the product is manufactured. In addition, under the new guidance we will begin to recognize an asset for the value of expected replacement part returns. At this time we have not identified any impacts to our financial statements that we believe will be material in the year of adoption. We are still evaluating the impact to certain revenue streams within our Energy  Transportation and Resource Industries segments and expect that evaluation to be completed during the first half of 2017. Based on the current estimated impact to our financial statements, we plan to adopt the new guidance under the modified retrospective approach. Variable interest entities (VIE) - In February 2015, the FASB issued accounting guidance on the consolidation of VIEs. The new guidance revises previous guidance by establishing an analysis for determining whether a limited partnership or similar entity is a VIE and whether outsourced decision-maker fees are considered variable interests. In addition, the new guidance revises how a reporting entity evaluates economics and related parties when assessing who should consolidate a VIE. The guidance was effective January 1, 2016 and did not have a material impact on our financial statements. Presentation of debt issuance costs - In April 2015, the FASB issued accounting guidance which requires debt issuance costs to be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying value of the associated debt liability. Prior to the issuance of the new guidance, debt issuance costs were required to be presented in the balance sheet as an asset. The guidance was effective January 1, 2016. We retrospectively adopted this guidance and as a result $80 million of debt issuance costs were reclassified from Other assets to Long-term debt due within one year and Long-term debt due after one year within Statement 3 as of December 31, 2015. Fair value disclosures for investments in certain entities that calculate net asset value per share - In May 2015, the FASB issued accounting guidance which removes the requirement to categorize within the fair value hierarchy investments measured at net asset value (or its equivalent) as a practical expedient for fair value. The new guidance requires that the amount of these investments continue to be disclosed to reconcile the fair value hierarchy disclosure to the balance sheet. The guidance was effective January 1, 2016 and was applied retrospectively. The adoption did not have a material impact on our financial statements. Simplifying the measurement of inventory - In July 2015, the FASB issued accounting guidance which requires that inventory be measured at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Prior to the issuance of the new guidance, inventory was measured at the lower of cost or market. Replacing the concept of market with the single measurement of net realizable value is intended to create efficiencies for preparers. Inventory measured using the last-in, first-out (LIFO) method and the retail inventory method are not impacted by the new guidance. The guidance was effective January 1, 2017 and will be applied prospectively. We do not expect the adoption to have a material impact on our financial statements. Simplifying the accounting for measurement-period adjustments - In September 2015, the FASB issued accounting guidance which eliminates the requirement for an acquirer in a business combination to restate prior period financial statements for measurement period adjustments. An acquirer in a business combination is required to report provisional amounts when measurements are incomplete at the end of the reporting period covering the business combination. Prior to the issuance of the new guidance, an acquirer was required to adjust such provisional amounts by restating prior period financial statements. Under the new guidance, the acquirer will recognize the measurement-period adjustment in the period the adjustment is determined. The guidance was effective January 1, 2016 and was applied prospectively. The adoption did not have a material impact on our financial statements. Balance sheet classification of deferred taxes - In November 2015, the FASB issued accounting guidance that requires all deferred tax assets and liabilities, along with any related valuation allowance, to be classified as noncurrent on the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position. Previous guidance required the deferred taxes for each jurisdiction to be presented as a net current asset or liability and net noncurrent asset or liability. As a result of the new guidance, each jurisdiction will now only have one net noncurrent deferred tax asset or liability. The new guidance does not change the existing requirement that only permits offsetting deferred tax assets and liabilities within a single jurisdiction. We had the option to apply the new guidance prospectively or retrospectively. The new guidance was effective January 1, 2017, with early adoption permitted. We adopted the new guidance effective January 1, 2016 and applied it retrospectively. The adoption resulted in the reclassification of current deferred tax assets and liabilities to noncurrent assets and liabilities on Statement 3. For the year ended December 31, 2015, Deferred and refundable income taxes were reduced by $910 million (the remaining balance of $616 million was reclassified to Prepaid expenses and other current assets), Noncurrent deferred and refundable income taxes were increased by $835 million , Other current liabilities were reduced by $59 million and Other liabilities were reduced by $16 million . Recognition and measurement of financial assets and financial liabilities - In January 2016, the FASB issued accounting guidance that affects the accounting for equity investments, financial liabilities accounted for under the fair value option and the presentation and disclosure requirements for financial instruments. Under the new guidance, all equity investments in unconsolidated entities (other than those accounted for using the equity method of accounting) will generally be measured at fair value through earnings. There will no longer be an available-for-sale classification for equity securities with readily determinable fair values. For financial liabilities when the fair value option has been elected, changes in fair value due to instrument-specific credit risk will be recognized separately in other comprehensive income. In addition, the FASB clarified guidance related to the valuation allowance assessment when recognizing deferred tax assets resulting from unrealized losses on available-for-sale debt securities. The new guidance is effective January 1, 2018, with the cumulative effect adjustment from initially applying the new guidance recognized in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position as of the beginning of the year of adoption. The impact on our financial statements at the time of adoption will primarily be based on changes in the fair value of our available-for-sale equity securities subsequent to January 1, 2018, which will be recorded through earnings. Lease accounting - In February 2016, the FASB issued accounting guidance that revises the accounting for leases. Under the new guidance, lessees are required to recognize a right-of-use asset and a lease liability for all leases. The new guidance will continue to classify leases as either financing or operating, with classification affecting the pattern of expense recognition. The accounting applied by a lessor under the new guidance will be substantially equivalent to current lease accounting guidance. The new guidance is effective January 1, 2019 with early adoption permitted. The new standard is required to be applied with a modified retrospective approach to each prior reporting period presented and provides for certain practical expedients. We are in the process of evaluating the effect of the new guidance on our financial statements. Stock-based compensation  - In March 2016, the FASB issued accounting guidance to simplify several aspects of the accounting for share-based payments. The new guidance changes how reporting entities account for certain aspects of share-based payments, including the accounting for income taxes and the classification of the tax impact on the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flow. Under the new guidance all excess tax benefits and deficiencies during the period are to be recognized in income (rather than equity) on a prospective basis. The guidance removes the requirement to delay recognition of excess tax benefits until it reduces income taxes currently payable. This change is required to be applied on a modified retrospective basis, resulting in a cumulative-effect adjustment to opening retained earnings in the period of adoption. In addition, Cash flows related to excess tax benefits will be included in Cash provided by operating activities and will no longer be separately classified as a financing activity. We will adopt this change retrospectively. The guidance was effective January 1, 2017. We do not expect the adoption to have a material impact on our financial statements. Measurement of credit losses on financial instruments  - In June 2016, the FASB issued accounting guidance to introduce a new model for recognizing credit losses on financial instruments based on an estimate of current expected credit losses. The new guidance will apply to loans, accounts receivable, trade receivables, other financial assets measured at amortized cost, loan commitments and other off-balance sheet credit exposures. The new guidance will also apply to debt securities and other financial assets measured at fair value through other comprehensive income. The new guidance is effective January 1, 2020, with early adoption permitted beginning January 1, 2019. We are in the process of evaluating the effect of the new guidance on our financial statements. Classification for certain cash receipts and cash payments  - In August 2016, the FASB issued accounting guidance related to the presentation and classification of certain transactions in the statement of cash flows where diversity in practice exists. The guidance is effective January 1, 2018 with early adoption permitted. We do not expect the adoption to have a material impact on our financial statements. Tax accounting for intra-entity asset transfers  - In October 2016, the FASB issued accounting guidance that will require the tax effects of intra-entity asset transfers to be recognized in the period when the transfer occurs. Under current guidance, the tax effects of intra-entity sales of assets are deferred until the transferred asset is sold to a third party or otherwise recovered through use. The new guidance does not apply to intra-entity transfers of inventory. The guidance is effective January 1, 2018 with early adoption permitted and is required to be applied on a modified retrospective basis through a cumulative effect adjustment to retained earnings as of the beginning of the period of adoption. We are in the process of evaluating the effect of the new guidance on our financial statements and do not expect to early adopt. Classification of restricted cash  - In November 2016, the FASB issued accounting guidance related to the presentation and classification of changes in restricted cash on the statement of cash flows where diversity in practice exists. The new standard is required to be applied with a retrospective approach. The guidance is effective January 1, 2018 with early adoption permitted. We do not expect the adoption to have a material impact on our financial statements. Clarification on the definition of a business  - In January 2017, the FASB issued accounting guidance to clarify the definition of a business with the objective of adding guidance to assist entities with evaluating whether transactions should be accounted for as acquisitions (or disposals) of assets or businesses. The guidance is effective January 1, 2018 with early adoption permitted. We plan to adopt this guidance January 1, 2017, and we do not expect the adoption to have a material impact on our financial statements. Simplifying the measurement for goodwill - In January 2017, the FASB issued guidance to simplify the accounting for goodwill impairment. The guidance removes Step 2 of the goodwill impairment test, which requires a hypothetical purchase price allocation. A goodwill impairment will now be the amount by which a reporting units carrying value exceeds its fair value, not to exceed the carrying amount of goodwill. The new guidance will be applied prospectively and is effective January 1, 2020, with early adoption permitted beginning January 1, 2017. We are in the process of evaluating the effect of the new guidance on our financial statements. ##TABLE_START 2. Stock-based compensation ##TABLE_END  Our stock-based compensation plans primarily provide for the granting of stock options, stock-settled stock appreciation rights (SARs), restricted stock units (RSUs) and performance-based restricted stock units (PRSUs) to Officers and other key employees, as well as non-employee Directors. Stock options permit a holder to buy Caterpillar stock at the stocks price when the option was granted. SARs permit a holder the right to receive the value in shares of the appreciation in Caterpillar stock that occurred from the date the right was granted up to the date of exercise. RSUs are agreements to issue shares of Caterpillar stock at the time of vesting. PRSUs are similar to RSUs and include performance conditions in the vesting terms of the award.  Our long-standing practices and policies specify all stock-based compensation awards are approved by the Compensation Committee (the Committee) of the Board of Directors on the date of grant. The stock-based award approval process specifies the number of awards granted, the terms of the award and the grant date. The same terms and conditions are consistently applied to all employee grants, including Officers. The Committee approves all individual Officer grants. The number of stock-based compensation awards included in an individuals award is determined based on the methodology approved by the Committee. The exercise price methodology approved by the Committee is the closing price of the Company stock on the date of the grant. The 2014 grant was issued under the Caterpillar Inc. 2006 Long-Term Incentive Plan (approved by stockholders in June of 2006). In June of 2014, stockholders approved the Caterpillar Inc. 2014 Long-Term Incentive Plan under which all new stock-based compensation awards are granted.  Common stock issued from Treasury stock under the plans totaled 4,164,134 for 2016 , 2,931,595 for 2015 and 10,106,542 for 2014 . The total number of shares authorized for equity awards under the Caterpillar Inc. 2014 Long-Term Incentive Plan is 38,800,000 , of which 17,231,358 shares remained available for issuance as of December 31, 2016.  Awards granted prior to 2015 generally vest three years after the date of grant (cliff vesting). The awards granted in 2015 and 2016 generally vest according to a three -year graded vesting schedule. One-third of the award will become vested on the first anniversary of the grant date, one-third of the award will become vested on the second anniversary of the grant date and one-third of the award will become vested on the third anniversary of the grant date. Beginning in 2015, PRSUs were granted. PRSUs generally have a three -year performance period and cliff vest at the end of the period based upon achievement of performance targets established at the time of grant. At grant, SARs and option awards have a term life of ten years . Upon separation from service, if the participant is 55 years of age or older with more than five years of service, the participant meets the criteria for a Long Service Separation and all outstanding stock options, SARs and RSUs will immediately vest. Outstanding PRSUs granted to employees with a \"Long Service Separation\" will vest at the end of the performance period based upon achievement of the performance target. For awards granted prior to 2016, if the Long Service Separation criteria are met, the vested options/SARs will have a life that is the lesser of ten years from the original grant date or five years from the separation date. For awards granted in 2016, the vested options/SARs will have a life equal to ten years from the original grant date. Compensation expense is fully recognized immediately on the grant date for employees who met the criteria for a \"Long Service Separation\". For employees who become eligible for immediate vesting under a \"Long Service Separation\" subsequent to the grant date and prior to the completion of the vesting period, compensation expense is recognized over the period from grant date to the date eligibility is achieved.  Accounting guidance on share-based payments requires companies to estimate the fair value of options/SARs on the date of grant using an option-pricing model. The fair value of our option/SAR grants was estimated using a lattice-based option-pricing model. The lattice-based option-pricing model considers a range of assumptions related to volatility, risk-free interest rate and historical employee behavior. Expected volatility was based on historical Caterpillar stock price movement and current implied volatilities from traded options on Caterpillar stock. The risk-free rate was based on U.S. Treasury security yields at the time of grant. The weighted-average dividend yield was based on historical information. The expected life was determined from the lattice-based model. The lattice-based model incorporated exercise and post vesting forfeiture assumptions based on analysis of historical data. The following table provides the assumptions used in determining the fair value of the stock-based awards for the years ended December 31, 2016 , 2015 and 2014 , respectively. ##TABLE_START  Grant Year    Weighted-average dividend yield 3.2 %  2.3 %  2.2 % Weighted-average volatility 31.1 %  28.4 %  28.2 % Range of volatilities 22.5-33.4%  19.9-35.9%  18.4-36.2% Range of risk-free interest rates 0.62-1.73%  0.22-2.08%  0.12-2.60% Weighted-average expected lives 8 years  8 years  8 years       ##TABLE_END The fair value of RSU and PRSU grants was estimated by reducing the stock price on the date of grant by the present value of the estimated dividends to be paid during the vesting period. The estimated dividends are based on Caterpillars quarterly dividend per share at the time of the grant.

Stock-based compensation expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period for awards with terms that specify cliff or graded vesting and contain only service conditions. Stock-based compensation expense for PRSUs is based on the probable number of shares expected to vest and is recognized primarily on a straight-line basis. Before tax, stock-based compensation expense for 2016 , 2015 and 2014 was $218 million , $283 million and $254 million , respectively, with a corresponding income tax benefit of $61 million , $87 million and $79 million , respectively. The amount of stock-based compensation expense capitalized for the years ended December 31, 2016 , 2015 and 2014 did not have a significant impact on our financial statements.  At December 31, 2016 , there was $170 million of total unrecognized compensation cost from stock-based compensation arrangements granted under the plans, which is related to non-vested stock-based awards. The compensation expense is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of approximately 1.6 years . We currently use shares in treasury stock to satisfy share award exercises.  The cash tax benefits realized from stock awards exercised for 2016 , 2015 and 2014 were $104 million , $68 million and $253 million , respectively. We use the direct only method and tax law ordering approach to calculate the tax effects of stock-based compensation. In certain jurisdictions, tax deductions for exercises of stock-based awards did not generate a cash benefit. A tax benefit of approximately $15 million will be recorded in additional paid-in capital when these deductions reduce our future income taxes payable.  ##TABLE_START 3. Derivative financial instruments and risk management ##TABLE_END  Our earnings and cash flow are subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates and commodity prices. Our Risk Management Policy (policy) allows for the use of derivative financial instruments to prudently manage foreign currency exchange rate, interest rate and commodity price exposures. Our policy specifies that derivatives are not to be used for speculative purposes. Derivatives that we use are primarily foreign currency forward, option and cross currency contracts, interest rate contracts and commodity forward and option contracts. Our derivative activities are subject to the management, direction and control of our senior financial officers. Risk management practices, including the use of financial derivative instruments, are presented to the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors at least annually.  All derivatives are recognized in Statement 3 at their fair value. On the date the derivative contract is entered into, we designate the derivative as (1) a hedge of the fair value of a recognized asset or liability (fair value hedge), (2) a hedge of a forecasted transaction or the variability of cash flow (cash flow hedge) or (3) an undesignated instrument. Changes in the fair value of a derivative that is qualified, designated and highly effective as a fair value hedge, along with the gain or loss on the hedged recognized asset or liability that is attributable to the hedged risk, are recorded in current earnings. Changes in the fair value of a derivative that is qualified, designated and highly effective as a cash flow hedge are recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) (AOCI), to the extent effective, in Statement 3 until they are reclassified to earnings in the same period or periods during which the hedged transaction affects earnings. Changes in the fair value of undesignated derivative instruments and the ineffective portion of designated derivative instruments are reported in current earnings. Cash flows from designated derivative financial instruments are classified within the same category as the item being hedged on Statement 5. Cash flows from undesignated derivative financial instruments are included in the investing category on Statement 5.  We formally document all relationships between hedging instruments and hedged items, as well as the risk-management objective and strategy for undertaking various hedge transactions. This process includes linking all derivatives that are designated as fair value hedges to specific assets and liabilities in Statement 3 and linking cash flow hedges to specific forecasted transactions or variability of cash flow.  We also formally assess, both at the hedges inception and on an ongoing basis, whether the designated derivatives that are used in hedging transactions are highly effective in offsetting changes in fair values or cash flow of hedged items. When a derivative is determined not to be highly effective as a hedge or the underlying hedged transaction is no longer probable, we discontinue hedge accounting prospectively, in accordance with the derecognition criteria for hedge accounting.  ##TABLE_START A. Foreign currency exchange rate risk ##TABLE_END  Foreign currency exchange rate movements create a degree of risk by affecting the U.S. dollar value of sales made and costs incurred in foreign currencies. Movements in foreign currency rates also affect our competitive position as these changes may affect business practices and/or pricing strategies of non-U.S.-based competitors. Additionally, we have balance sheet positions denominated in foreign currencies, thereby creating exposure to movements in exchange rates.  Our Machinery, Energy  Transportation operations purchase, manufacture and sell products in many locations around the world. As we have a diversified revenue and cost base, we manage our future foreign currency cash flow exposure on a net basis. We use foreign currency forward and option contracts to manage unmatched foreign currency cash inflow and outflow. Our objective is to minimize the risk of exchange rate movements that would reduce the U.S. dollar value of our foreign currency cash flow. Our policy allows for managing anticipated foreign currency cash flow for up to five years . As of December 31, 2016 , the maximum term of these outstanding contracts was approximately 51 months .  We generally designate as cash flow hedges at inception of the contract any Australian dollar, Brazilian real, British pound, Canadian dollar, Chinese yuan, euro, Indian rupee, Japanese yen, Mexican peso, Norwegian krona, Singapore dollar, Swiss franc, or Thailand baht forward or option contracts that meet the requirements for hedge accounting and the maturity extends beyond the current quarter-end. Designation is performed on a specific exposure basis to support hedge accounting. The remainder of Machinery, Energy  Transportation foreign currency contracts are undesignated.  As of December 31, 2016 , $52 million of deferred net losses, net of tax, included in equity (AOCI in Statement 3), are expected to be reclassified to current earnings (Other income (expense) in Statement 1) over the next twelve months when earnings are affected by the hedged transactions. The actual amount recorded in Other income (expense) will vary based on exchange rates at the time the hedged transactions impact earnings.  In managing foreign currency risk for our Financial Products operations, our objective is to minimize earnings volatility resulting from conversion and the remeasurement of net foreign currency balance sheet positions, and future transactions denominated in foreign currencies. Our policy allows the use of foreign currency forward, option and cross currency contracts to offset the risk of currency mismatch between our assets and liabilities, and exchange rate risk associated with future transactions denominated in foreign currencies. Our foreign currency forward, option and cross currency contracts are primarily undesignated. We designate fixed-to-fixed cross currency contracts as cash flow hedges to protect against movements in exchange rates on foreign currency fixed rate assets and liabilities.  ##TABLE_START B. Interest rate risk ##TABLE_END  Interest rate movements create a degree of risk by affecting the amount of our interest payments and the value of our fixed-rate debt. Our practice is to use interest rate derivatives to manage our exposure to interest rate changes.  Our Machinery, Energy  Transportation operations generally use fixed-rate debt as a source of funding. Our objective is to minimize the cost of borrowed funds. Our policy allows us to enter into fixed-to-floating interest rate contracts and forward rate agreements to meet that objective. We designate fixed-to-floating interest rate contracts as fair value hedges at inception of the contract, and we designate certain forward rate agreements as cash flow hedges at inception of the contract. Financial Products operations has a match-funding policy that addresses interest rate risk by aligning the interest rate profile (fixed or floating rate) of Cat Financials debt portfolio with the interest rate profile of their receivables portfolio within predetermined ranges on an ongoing basis. In connection with that policy, we use interest rate derivative instruments to modify the debt structure to match assets within the receivables portfolio. This matched funding reduces the volatility of margins between interest-bearing assets and interest-bearing liabilities, regardless of which direction interest rates move.  Our policy allows us to use fixed-to-floating, floating-to-fixed and floating-to-floating interest rate contracts to meet the match-funding objective. We designate fixed-to-floating interest rate contracts as fair value hedges to protect debt against changes in fair value due to changes in the benchmark interest rate. We designate most floating-to-fixed interest rate contracts as cash flow hedges to protect against the variability of cash flows due to changes in the benchmark interest rate. We have, at certain times, liquidated fixed-to-floating and floating-to-fixed interest rate contracts at both Machinery, Energy  Transportation and Financial Products. The gains or losses associated with these contracts at the time of liquidation are amortized into earnings over the original term of the previously designated hedged item.  ##TABLE_START C. Commodity price risk ##TABLE_END  Commodity price movements create a degree of risk by affecting the price we must pay for certain raw material. Our policy is to use commodity forward and option contracts to manage the commodity risk and reduce the cost of purchased materials.  Our Machinery, Energy  Transportation operations purchase base and precious metals embedded in the components we purchase from suppliers. Our suppliers pass on to us price changes in the commodity portion of the component cost. In addition, we are subject to price changes on energy products such as natural gas and diesel fuel purchased for operational use.  Our objective is to minimize volatility in the price of these commodities. Our policy allows us to enter into commodity forward and option contracts to lock in the purchase price of a portion of these commodities within a five -year horizon. All such commodity forward and option contracts are undesignated. The location and fair value of derivative instruments reported in Statement 3 are as follows:  ##TABLE_START  Consolidated Statement of Financial Position Location  Asset (Liability) Fair Value (Millions of dollars)   Years ended December 31,     Designated derivatives      Foreign exchange contracts      Machinery, Energy  Transportation Receivables  trade and other  $  $ Machinery, Energy  Transportation Accrued expenses  (93 )  (25 ) Machinery, Energy  Transportation Other liabilities  (36 )   Financial Products Long-term receivables  trade and other    Financial Products Accrued expenses  (3 )   Interest rate contracts      Financial Products Receivables  trade and other    Financial Products Long-term receivables  trade and other   Financial Products Accrued expenses  (1 )  (4 )    $ (87 )  $       Undesignated derivatives      Foreign exchange contracts      Machinery, Energy  Transportation Receivables  trade and other  $   $ Machinery, Energy  Transportation Accrued expenses  (30 )  (9 ) Financial Products Receivables  trade and other   Financial Products Long-term receivables  trade and other    Financial Products Accrued expenses  (4 )  (6 ) Commodity contracts      Machinery, Energy  Transportation Receivables  trade and other    Machinery, Energy  Transportation Accrued expenses    (12 )    $  $       ##TABLE_ENDThe total notional amounts of the derivative instruments are as follows: ##TABLE_START  Years ended December 31, (Millions of dollars)        Machinery, Energy  Transportation  $ 2,530  $ 2,040 Financial Products  $ 2,626  $ 3,539      ##TABLE_ENDThe notional amounts of the derivative financial instruments do not represent amounts exchanged by the parties.

The indefinitely reinvested profits of Caterpillar SARL (CSARL), primarily taxable in Switzerland, contribute the most significant amount of this line item. Although not individually significant by jurisdiction, pre-tax permanent differences due to nondeductible net foreign exchange losses of non-U.S. subsidiaries were approximately $130 million in 2016 and 2015 and less than $10 million in 2014 . The provision for income taxes for 2016 also includes an increase in the valuation allowance for U.S. state deferred tax assets resulting in a $141 million non-cash charge, net of federal deferred tax adjustment at 35 percent . The primary driver of the increase is recent U.S. GAAP losses expected to recur in 2017 in certain state jurisdictions and the weight given this negative objective evidence under income tax accounting guidance. The provision for income taxes for 2015 included a $42 million net charge to increase unrecognized tax benefits by $68 million offset by a benefit of $26 million to record U.S. refund claims related to prior tax years currently under examination. In the audit of 2007 to 2009 including the loss carryback to 2005, the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (IRS) disallowed approximately $125 million of foreign tax credits that arose as a result of certain financings unrelated to CSARL. Decisions of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit involving other taxpayers in 2015 caused us to conclude the benefits of this uncertain tax position were no longer more likely than not to be sustained based on technical merits resulting in an increase of $68 million to unrecognized tax benefits. We will continue to monitor ongoing court cases involving other taxpayers for information that may impact our analysis of this tax position. The provision for income taxes for 2014 included a benefit of $23 million for the release of a valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets of a non-U.S. subsidiary and a net benefit of $21 million to adjust prior years' U.S. taxes and interest. The net benefit for prior years' U.S. taxes and interest included a $33 million benefit to reflect a settlement with the IRS related to 1992 through 1994 which resulted in a $16 million benefit to remeasure previously unrecognized tax benefits and a $17 million benefit to adjust related interest, net of tax. This benefit of $33 million was offset by a net charge of $12 million to adjust prior years' U.S. taxes that included a charge of $55 million to correct for an error which resulted in an understatement of tax liabilities for prior years. Management has concluded that the error was not material to any period presented. We have recorded income tax expense at U.S. tax rates on all profits, except for undistributed profits of non-U.S. subsidiaries of approximately $16 billion which are considered indefinitely reinvested. Upon distribution of these profits in the form of dividends or otherwise, we would be subject to both U.S. income taxes (subject to an adjustment for foreign tax credits) and in some instances withholding taxes payable to the various non-U.S. jurisdictions. Determination of the amount of unrecognized deferred tax liability related to indefinitely reinvested profits is not feasible primarily due to our legal entity structure and the complexity of U.S. and local tax laws. If management intentions or U.S. tax law changes in the future, there could be a significant negative impact on the provision for income taxes to record an incremental tax liability in the period the change occurs. At December 31, 2016 , cash and short-term investments held by non-U.S. subsidiaries was approximately $5 billion .  Accounting for income taxes under U.S. GAAP requires that individual tax-paying entities of the company offset all deferred tax liabilities and assets within each particular tax jurisdiction and present them as a noncurrent deferred tax liability or asset in the Consolidated Financial Position. Amounts in different tax jurisdictions cannot be offset against each other. The amount of deferred income taxes at December 31, included on the following lines in Statement 3, are as follows:  ##TABLE_START   December 31, (Millions of dollars)   Assets:     Noncurrent deferred and refundable income taxes  2,683  2,367 Liabilities:     Other liabilities   Deferred income taxesnet  $ 2,446  $ 2,032      ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START Deferred income tax assets and liabilities:       December 31, (Millions of dollars)   Deferred income tax assets:     Pension  $ 1,887  $ 1,694 Postemployment benefits other than pensions  1,318  1,339 Tax carryforwards  1,999  1,098 Warranty reserves   Stock-based compensation   Inventory   Allowance for credit losses   Post sale discounts   Other employee compensation and benefits   Othernet     7,106  6,059      Deferred income tax liabilities:     Capital and intangible assets  (2,455 )  (2,561 ) Bond discount  (223 )  (225 ) Translation  (368 )  (343 ) Other outside basis differences  (227 )   Undistributed profits of non-U.S. subsidiaries  (285 )  (82 )   (3,558 )  (3,211 ) Valuation allowance for deferred tax assets  (1,102 )  (816 ) Deferred income taxesnet  $ 2,446  $ 2,032      ##TABLE_END At December 31, 2016 , approximately $1,425 million of U.S. state tax net operating losses (NOLs) and $137 million of U.S. state tax credit carryforwards were available. The state NOLs primarily expire between 2017 and 2036. The state tax credit carryforwards primarily expire over the next five years with certain carryforwards set to expire over the next fifteen years . In total, we have established a valuation allowance of $442 million related to certain of these carryforwards along with other U.S. state deferred tax assets.  At December 31, 2016 , approximately $920 million of U.S. foreign tax credits were available for carryforward. These credits expire between 2025 and 2027. At December 31, 2016 , amounts and expiration dates of net operating loss carryforwards in various non-U.S. taxing jurisdictions were:  ##TABLE_START (Millions of dollars)    2020-2022  2023-2037  Unlimited  Total $  $  $  $  $  $ 3,191  $ 4,055 ##TABLE_END At December 31, 2016 , non-U.S. entities that have not yet demonstrated consistent and/or sustainable profitability to support the realization of net deferred tax assets have recorded valuation allowances of $660 million , including certain entities in Luxembourg.

We recognized a net provision for interest and penalties of $34 million , $20 million and $3 million during the years ended December 31, 2016 , 2015 and 2014 , respectively. The total amount of interest and penalties accrued was $120 million and $79 million as of December 31, 2016 and 2015 , respectively.  In January 2015, we received a Revenue Agent's Report (RAR) from the IRS indicating the end of the field examination of our U.S. income tax returns for 2007 to 2009 including the impact of a loss carryback to 2005. The IRS field examination for 2010 to 2012 that began in 2015 is expected to be completed in 2017. In November 2016, we received notices of proposed adjustments from the IRS for the 2010 to 2012 exam. In both these audits, the IRS has proposed to tax in the United States profits earned from certain parts transactions by CSARL, based on the IRS examination teams application of the substance-over-form or assignment-of-income judicial doctrines. We are vigorously contesting the proposed increases to tax and penalties for these years of approximately $2 billion . We believe that the relevant transactions complied with applicable tax laws and did not violate judicial doctrines. We have filed U.S. income tax returns on this same basis for years after 2012. Based on the information currently available, we do not anticipate a significant increase or decrease to our unrecognized tax benefits for this matter within the next 12 months. We currently believe the ultimate disposition of this matter will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position, liquidity or results of operations. With the exception of a loss carryback to 2005, tax years prior to 2007 are generally no longer subject to U.S. tax assessment. In our major non-U.S. jurisdictions including Australia, Brazil, China, Germany, Japan, Switzerland, Singapore and the U.K., tax years are typically subject to examination for three to eight years . Due to the uncertainty related to the timing and potential outcome of audits, we cannot estimate the range of reasonably possible change in unrecognized tax benefits in the next 12 months. ##TABLE_START 6.

Accordingly, this presentation should not be regarded as a forecast of future cash collections. Please refer to Note 18 and Table III for fair value information.  ##TABLE_START C. Allowance for credit losses ##TABLE_END  The allowance for credit losses is an estimate of the losses inherent in Cat Financials finance receivable portfolio and includes consideration of accounts that have been individually identified as impaired, as well as pools of finance receivables where it is probable that certain receivables in the pool are impaired but the individual accounts cannot yet be identified. In identifying and measuring impairment, management takes into consideration past loss experience, known and inherent risks in the portfolio, adverse situations that may affect the borrowers ability to repay, estimated value of underlying collateral and current economic conditions. Accounts are identified for individual review based on past-due status and using information available about the customer, such as financial statements, news reports and published credit ratings, as well as general information regarding industry trends and the economic environment in which Cat Financials customers operate. The allowance for credit losses attributable to finance receivables that are individually evaluated and determined to be impaired is based either on the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the receivables' effective interest rate or the fair value of the collateral for collateral-dependent receivables. In determining collateral value, Cat Financial estimates the current fair market value of the collateral less selling costs. Cat Financial also considers credit enhancements such as additional collateral and contractual third-party guarantees. The allowance for credit losses attributable to the remaining accounts not yet individually identified as impaired is estimated based on loss forecast models utilizing probabilities of default, our estimate of the loss emergence period and the estimated loss given default. In addition, qualitative factors not able to be fully captured in the loss forecast models including industry trends, macroeconomic factors and model imprecision are considered in the evaluation of the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses. These qualitative factors are subjective and require a degree of management judgment. Cat Financials allowance for credit losses is segregated into two portfolio segments:  ##TABLE_START  Customer - Finance receivables with retail customers. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  Dealer - Finance receivables with Caterpillar dealers. ##TABLE_END A portfolio segment is the level at which the Company develops a systematic methodology for determining its allowance for credit losses.  Cat Financial further evaluates portfolio segments by the class of finance receivables, which is defined as a level of information (below a portfolio segment) in which the finance receivables have the same initial measurement attribute and a similar method for assessing and monitoring credit risk. Typically, Cat Financials finance receivables within a geographic area have similar credit risk profiles and methods for assessing and monitoring credit risk. Cat Financials classes, which align with management reporting for credit losses, are as follows:  ##TABLE_START  North America - Finance receivables originated in the United States or Canada. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  Europe - Finance receivables originated in Europe, Africa, Middle East and the Commonwealth of Independent States. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  Asia Pacific - Finance receivables originated in Australia, New Zealand, China, Japan, South Korea and Southeast Asia. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  Mining - Finance receivables related to large mining customers worldwide and project financing in various countries. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  Latin America - Finance receivables originated in Central and South American countries and Mexico. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  Caterpillar Power Finance - Finance receivables related to marine vessels with Caterpillar engines worldwide and Caterpillar electrical power generation, gas compression and co-generation systems and non-Caterpillar equipment that is powered by these systems worldwide. ##TABLE_END An analysis of the allowance for credit losses was as follows: ##TABLE_START (Millions of dollars)  December 31, 2016   Customer  Dealer  Total Allowance for Credit Losses:       Balance at beginning of year  $  $  $ Receivables written off  (158 )    (158 ) Recoveries on receivables previously written off     Provision for credit losses    Other  (5 )    (5 ) Balance at end of year  $  $  $        Individually evaluated for impairment  $  $   $ Collectively evaluated for impairment    Ending Balance  $  $  $        Recorded Investment in Finance Receivables:       Individually evaluated for impairment  $  $   $ Collectively evaluated for impairment  18,236  3,375  21,611 Ending Balance  $ 19,022  $ 3,375  $ 22,397        ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START (Millions of dollars)  December 31, 2015   Customer  Dealer  Total Allowance for Credit Losses:       Balance at beginning of year  $  $  $ Receivables written off  (196 )    (196 ) Recoveries on receivables previously written off     Provision for credit losses   (1 )  Other  (25 )    (25 ) Balance at end of year  $  $  $        Individually evaluated for impairment  $  $   $ Collectively evaluated for impairment    Ending Balance  $  $  $        Recorded Investment in Finance Receivables:       Individually evaluated for impairment  $  $   $ Collectively evaluated for impairment  18,788  3,570  22,358 Ending Balance  $ 19,389  $ 3,570  $ 22,959        ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START        ##TABLE_ENDCredit quality of finance receivables  At origination, Cat Financial evaluates credit risk based on a variety of credit quality factors including prior payment experience, customer financial information, credit-rating agency ratings, loan-to-value ratios and other internal metrics. On an ongoing basis, Cat Financial monitors credit quality based on past-due status and collection experience as there is a meaningful correlation between the past-due status of customers and the risk of loss. In determining past-due status, Cat Financial considers the entire finance receivable balance past due when any installment is over 30 days past due.

Payments received while the finance receivable is on non-accrual status are applied to interest and principal in accordance with the contractual terms.  As of December 31, 2016 and 2015 there were no finance receivable on non-accrual status for the Dealer portfolio segment.

As a result of the sale, we recognized a pretax gain of $120 million (included in Other income (expense)) and derecognized the carrying value of our noncontrolling interest of $57 million , which was previously included in Other assets in Statement 3. The gain on the disposal is included as a reconciling item between Segment profit and Consolidated profit before taxes. The sale of this investment supports Caterpillar's increased focus on growth opportunities in its core businesses. 10. Intangible assets and goodwill ##TABLE_START A.

See Note 24 for details on this acquisition. Finite-lived intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives and tested for impairment if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset may be impaired. Gross customer relationship intangibles of $96 million and related accumulated amortization of $27 million as well as gross intellectual property intangibles of $111 million and related accumulated amortization of $48 million from the Resource Industries segment were impaired during 2016. The fair value of these intangibles was determined to be insignificant based on an income approach using expected cash flows. The fair value determination is categorized as Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy due to its use of internal projections and unobservable measurement inputs. The total impairment of $132 million was a result of restructuring activities and is included in Other operating (income) expense in Statement 1. See Note 25 for information on restructuring costs. Amortization expense related to intangible assets was $326 million , $337 million and $365 million for 2016 , 2015 and 2014 , respectively. As of December 31, 2016 , amortization expense related to intangible assets is expected to be: ##TABLE_START (Millions of dollars)      Thereafter $  $  $  $  $  $            ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START B. Goodwill ##TABLE_END  Our annual impairment tests completed in the fourth quarter of 2016 indicated the fair value of each reporting unit was substantially above its respective carrying value, including goodwill, with the exception of our Surface Mining  Technology reporting unit. The Surface Mining  Technology reporting unit, which primarily serves the mining industry, is a part of our Resource Industries segment. The goodwill assigned to this reporting unit is largely from our acquisition of Bucyrus International, Inc. in 2011. Its product portfolio includes large mining trucks, electric rope shovels, draglines, hydraulic shovels and related parts. In addition to equipment, Surface Mining  Technology also develops and sells technology products and services to provide customer fleet management, equipment management analytics and autonomous machine capabilities. The annual impairment test completed in the fourth quarter of 2016 indicated that the fair value of Surface Mining  Technology was below its carrying value requiring the second step of the goodwill impairment test process. The fair value of Surface Mining  Technology was determined primarily using an income approach based on a discounted ten year cash flow. We assigned the fair value to Surface Mining  Technologys assets and liabilities using various valuation techniques that required assumptions about royalty rates, dealer attrition, technological obsolescence and discount rates. The resulting implied fair value of goodwill was below the carrying value. Accordingly, we recognized a goodwill impairment charge of $595 million , which resulted in goodwill of $629 million remaining for Surface Mining  Technology as of October 1, 2016. The fair value determination is categorized as Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy due to its use of internal projections and unobservable measurement inputs. There was a $17 million tax benefit associated with this impairment charge. The mining industry has experienced significant weakness for several years as a result of low commodity prices. While we continue to expect the industry will improve, we believe the pace of the improvement will be slower and cash flows and profitability will be lower than previously forecasted. We believe the slow pace of improvement will in part be due to a large amount of equipment currently idled, particularly large mining trucks, some of which will be redeployed as end-user demand increases. In addition, we do not expect a dramatic increase in commodity prices, dampening the rate of growth in mining production and demand for our products. To reflect the gradual nature of the anticipated improvement, we used a ten year cash flow forecast period for the reporting unit rather than our typical five year forecast period. There were no goodwill impairments during 2015 or 2014 . During 2015, we acquired net assets with related goodwill aggregating $133 million primarily related to the purchases of Rail Product Solutions, Inc. ( $53 million ) and RDS Manufacturing, Inc. ( $59 million ). See Note 24 for details on these acquisitions. As discussed in Note 23, effective January 1, 2016, we revised our reportable segments in line with the changes to our organization structure. As a result of these changes, $118 million of goodwill was reassigned to Energy  Transportation from All Other segments. The changes in carrying amount of goodwill by reportable segment for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 were as follows: ##TABLE_START (Millions of dollars)  December 31, 2015  Acquisitions 1  Impairment Loss  Other Adjustments 2  December 31, 2016 Construction Industries           Goodwill  $  $   $   $  $ Impairment  (22 )        (22 ) Net goodwill        Resource Industries           Goodwill  4,145      (35 )  4,110 Impairment  (580 )    (595 )    (1,175 ) Net goodwill  3,565    (595 )  (35 )  2,935 Energy  Transportation           Goodwill  2,738     (19 )  2,756 All Other 3           Goodwill        Consolidated total           Goodwill  7,217     (37 )  7,217 Impairment  (602 )    (595 )    (1,197 ) Net goodwill  $ 6,615  $  $ (595 )  $ (37 )  $ 6,020              December 31, 2014  Acquisitions 1  Impairment Loss  Other Adjustments 2  December 31, 2015 Construction Industries           Goodwill  $  $   $   $ (12 )  $ Impairment  (22 )        (22 ) Net goodwill       (12 )  Resource Industries           Goodwill  4,287      (142 )  4,145 Impairment  (580 )        (580 ) Net goodwill  3,707      (142 )  3,565 Energy  Transportation           Goodwill  2,660     (55 )  2,738 All Other 3           Goodwill       (3 )  Consolidated total           Goodwill  7,296     (212 )  7,217 Impairment  (602 )        (602 ) Net goodwill  $ 6,694  $  $   $ (212 )  $ 6,615 ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START 1  See Note 24 for additional information. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START 2  Other adjustments are comprised primarily of foreign currency translation. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START 3  Includes All Other operating segments (See Note 23). ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START      ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START 11. Investments in debt and equity securities ##TABLE_END  We have investments in certain debt and equity securities, primarily at Insurance Services, that have been classified as available-for-sale and recorded at fair value. In addition, Insurance Services has an equity security investment in a real estate investment trust (REIT) which is recorded at fair value based on the net asset value (NAV) of the investment. These investments are primarily included in Other assets in Statement 3. Unrealized gains and losses arising from the revaluation of debt and equity securities are included, net of applicable deferred income taxes, in equity (Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in Statement 3). Realized gains and losses on sales of investments are generally determined using the specific identification method for debt and equity securities and are included in Other income (expense) in Statement 1.

The unrealized losses on our investments in corporate bonds relate to changes in interest rates and credit-related yield spreads since time of purchase. We do not intend to sell the investments and it is not likely that we will be required to sell the investments before recovery of their amortized cost basis. We do not consider these investments to be other-than-temporarily impaired as of December 31, 2016 . Mortgage-Backed Debt Securities. The unrealized losses on our investments in mortgage-backed securities relate to changes in interest rates and credit-related yield spreads since time of purchase.

Postemployment benefit plans ##TABLE_END  We provide defined benefit pension plans, defined contribution plans and/or other postretirement benefit plans (retirement health care and life insurance) to employees in many of our locations throughout the world. Our defined benefit pension plans provide a benefit based on years of service and/or the employees average earnings near retirement. Our defined contribution plans allow employees to contribute a portion of their salary to help save for retirement, and in most cases, we provide a matching contribution. The benefit obligation related to our non-U.S. defined benefit pension plans are for employees located primarily in Europe, Japan and Brazil. For other post retirement benefits (OPEB), substantially all of our benefit obligation is for employees located in the United States.  Our U.S. defined benefit pension plans for support and management employees were frozen for certain employees on December 31, 2010, and will freeze for remaining employees on December 31, 2019. On the respective transition dates employees move to a retirement benefit that provides a frozen pension benefit and a 401(k) plan that will include a matching contribution and a new annual employer contribution. As discussed in Note 26, during 2015 the company offered a voluntary retirement enhancement program to qualifying U.S. employees. This voluntary program impacted employees participating in certain U.S. pension and OPEB plans and resulted in a curtailment loss of $82 million , recognized in Other operating (income) expenses in Statement 1. At December 31, 2015, we changed our method for calculating the service and interest cost components of net periodic benefit cost. Historically, these components were determined utilizing a single weighted-average discount rate based on a yield curve used to measure the benefit obligation at the beginning of the period. Beginning in 2016, we elected to utilize a full yield curve approach in the estimation of service and interest costs by applying the specific spot rates along the yield curve used in the determination of the benefit obligation to the relevant projected cash flows. We made this change to provide a more precise measurement of service and interest costs by improving the correlation between the projected cash flows to the corresponding spot rates along the yield curve. Under the previous method the discount rate used for the service and interest components of cost would have been 4.2 percent for U.S. pensions, 3.2 percent for non-U.S. pension and 4.1 percent for OPEB. This change had no impact on our year-end defined benefit pension and OPEB obligations or our annual net periodic benefit cost as the lower service and interest costs were entirely offset in the actuarial loss (gain) reported. Compared to the method used in 2015, this change lowered service and interest costs by $180 million . This change was accounted for prospectively as a change in accounting estimate. ##TABLE_START A.

The U.S. discount rate is based on a benefit cash flow-matching approach and represents the rate at which our benefit obligations could effectively be settled as of our measurement date, December 31. The benefit cash flow-matching approach involves analyzing Caterpillars projected cash flows against a high quality bond yield curve, calculated using a wide population of corporate Aa bonds available on the measurement date. The very highest and lowest yielding bonds (top and bottom 10 percent ) are excluded from the analysis. A similar process is used to determine the assumed discount rate for our most significant non-U.S. plans. This rate is sensitive to changes in interest rates. A decrease in the discount rate would increase our obligation and future expense. ##TABLE_START B.

The current U.S. pension target asset allocations are 40 percent equities and 60 percent fixed income. These target allocations will be revisited periodically to ensure that they reflect our overall objectives. The non-U.S. pension weighted-average target allocations are 39 percent equities, 52 percent fixed income, 6 percent real estate and 3 percent other. The target allocations for each plan vary based upon local statutory requirements, demographics of plan participants and funded status. The non-U.S. plan assets are primarily invested in non-U.S. securities.  Our target allocations for the other postretirement benefit plans are 70 percent equities and 30 percent fixed income.  The U.S. plans are rebalanced to plus or minus 5 percentage points of the target asset allocation ranges on a monthly basis. The frequency of rebalancing for the non-U.S. plans varies depending on the plan. As a result of our diversification strategies, there are no significant concentrations of risk within the portfolio of investments.  The use of certain derivative instruments is permitted where appropriate and necessary for achieving overall investment policy objectives. The plans do not engage in derivative contracts for speculative purposes.  The accounting guidance on fair value measurements specifies a fair value hierarchy based upon the observability of inputs used in valuation techniques (Level 1, 2 and 3). See Note 18 for a discussion of the fair value hierarchy.

For pension plans in which all or almost all of the plan's participants are inactive and other postretirement benefit plans in which all or almost all of the plan's participants are fully eligible for benefits under the plan, prior service cost (credit) are amortized using the straight-line method over the remaining life expectancy of those participants. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START 4  Actuarial loss (gain) represent the effects of actual results differing from our assumptions and the effects of changing assumptions. We recognize actuarial loss (gain) immediately through earnings upon the annual remeasurement in the fourth quarter, or on an interim basis as triggering events warrant remeasurement. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START 5  The weighted-average rates for 2017 are 6.7 percent and 5.9 percent for U.S. and non-U.S. pension plans, respectively. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START      ##TABLE_ENDThe discount rates used in the determination of our service and interest cost components are determined by utilizing a full yield curve approach which applies specific spot rates along the yield curve used in the determination of the benefit obligation to the relevant projected cash flows. In 2015 and 2014, the discount rates used to determine these cost components were based on a single weighted-average discount rate based on the yield curve used to measure the benefit obligation at the beginning of the period.  Our U.S. expected long-term rate of return on plan assets is based on our estimate of long-term passive returns for equities and fixed income securities weighted by the allocation of our pension assets. Based on historical performance, we increase the passive returns due to our active management of the plan assets. To arrive at our expected long-term return, the amount added for active management was 0.90 percent for 2016 and 0.95 percent for 2015 and 1 percent for 2014 . A similar process is used to determine this rate for our non-U.S. plans.  The assumed health care trend rate represents the rate at which health care costs are assumed to increase. We assumed a weighted-average increase of 6.5 percent in our calculation of 2016 benefit expense. We expect a weighted-average increase of 6.6 percent during 2017. The 2017 rates are assumed to decrease gradually to the ultimate health care trend rate of 5 percent in 2022 . This rate represents 3 percent general inflation plus 2 percent additional health care inflation. Assumed health care cost trend rates have a significant effect on the amounts reported for the health care plans. A one-percentage-point change in assumed health care cost trend rates would have the following effects: ##TABLE_START (Millions of dollars)  One-percentage- point increase  One-percentage- point decrease Effect on 2016 service and interest cost components of other postretirement benefit cost  $  $ (15 ) Effect on accumulated postretirement benefit obligation  $  $ (150 ) ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START F. Other postemployment benefit plans ##TABLE_END  We offer long-term disability benefits, continued health care for disabled employees, survivor income benefit insurance and supplemental unemployment benefits to substantially all U.S. employees. ##TABLE_START G. Defined contribution plans ##TABLE_END  We have both U.S. and non-U.S. employee defined contribution plans to help employees save for retirement. Our primary U.S. 401(k) plan allows eligible employees to contribute a portion of their cash compensation to the plan on a tax-deferred basis. Employees with frozen defined benefit pension accruals are eligible for matching contributions equal to 100 percent of employee contributions to the plan up to 6 percent of cash compensation and an annual employer contribution that ranges from 3 to 5 percent of cash compensation (depending on years of service and age). Employees that are still accruing benefits under a defined benefit pension plan are eligible for matching contributions equal to 50 percent of employee contributions up to 6 percent of cash compensation. These 401(k) plans include various investment funds, including a non-leveraged employee stock ownership plan (ESOP). As of December 31, 2016 and 2015 , the ESOP held 21.3 million and 26.4 million  shares, respectively. All of the shares held by the ESOP were allocated to participant accounts. Dividends paid to participants are automatically reinvested into company shares unless the participant elects to have all or a portion of the dividend paid to the participant. Various other U.S. and non-U.S. defined contribution plans allow eligible employees to contribute a portion of their salary to the plans, and in most cases, we provide a matching contribution to the funds.

Based on management's allocation decision, which can be revised from time to time, the portion of the Credit Facility available to MET as of December 31, 2016 was $2.75 billion . Our three Global Credit Facilities are:  ##TABLE_START  The 364 -day facility of $3.15 billion (of which $0.82 billion is available to MET) expires in September 2017. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  The three -year facility, as amended and restated in September 2016, of $2.73 billion (of which $0.72 billion is available to MET) expires in September 2019. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  The five -year facility, as amended and restated in September 2016, of $4.62 billion (of which $1.21 billion is available to MET) expires in September 2021. ##TABLE_END Other consolidated credit lines with banks as of December 31, 2016 totaled $3.82 billion . These committed and uncommitted credit lines, which may be eligible for renewal at various future dates or have no specified expiration date, are used primarily by our subsidiaries for local funding requirements. Caterpillar or Cat Financial may guarantee subsidiary borrowings under these lines. At December 31, 2016 , Caterpillar's consolidated net worth was $13.20 billion , which was above the $9.00 billion required under the Credit Facility. The consolidated net worth is defined as the consolidated stockholder's equity including preferred stock but excluding the pension and other postretirement benefits balance within Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). At December 31, 2016 , Cat Financial's covenant interest coverage ratio was 1.92 to 1 . This is above the 1.15 to 1 minimum ratio, calculated as (1) profit excluding income taxes, interest expense and net gain/(loss) from interest rate derivatives to (2) interest expense calculated at the end of each calendar quarter for the rolling four quarter period then most recently ended, required by the Credit Facility. In addition, at December 31, 2016 , Cat Financial's six-month covenant leverage ratio was 7.35 to 1 and year-end covenant leverage ratio was 7.60 to 1 . This is below the maximum ratio of debt to net worth of 10 to 1 , calculated (1) on a monthly basis as the average of the leverage ratios determined on the last day of each of the six preceding calendar months and (2) at each December 31, required by the Credit Facility. In the event Caterpillar or Cat Financial does not meet one or more of their respective financial covenants under the Credit Facility in the future (and are unable to obtain a consent or waiver), the syndicate of banks may terminate the commitments allocated to the party that does not meet its covenants. Additionally, in such event, certain of Cat Financial's other lenders under other loan agreements where similar financial covenants or cross default provisions are applicable, may, at their election, choose to pursue remedies under those loan agreements, including accelerating the repayment of outstanding borrowings. At December 31, 2016 , there were no borrowings under the Credit Facility.  ##TABLE_START 16.

In February 2007, the Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of $7.5 billion of Caterpillar common stock (the 2007 Authorization), and in December 2011, the 2007 Authorization was extended through December 2015. In January 2014, we completed the 2007 Authorization and entered into a definitive agreement with Citibank, N.A. to purchase shares of our common stock under an accelerated stock repurchase transaction (January 2014 ASR Agreement), which was completed in March 2014. In accordance with the terms of the January 2014 ASR Agreement, a total of approximately 18.1 million shares of our common stock were repurchased at an aggregate cost to Caterpillar of approximately $1.7 billion . In January 2014, the Board approved a new authorization to repurchase up to $10.0 billion of Caterpillar common stock, which will expire on December 31, 2018. In July 2014, we entered into definitive agreements with Socit Gnrale to purchase shares of our common stock under accelerated stock repurchase transactions (July 2014 ASR Agreements) which were completed in September 2014. In accordance with the terms of the July 2014 ASR Agreements, a total of approximately 23.7 million shares of our common stock were repurchased at an aggregate cost to Caterpillar of $2.5 billion . In July 2015, we entered into a definitive agreement with Citibank, N.A. to purchase shares of our common stock under an accelerated stock repurchase transaction (July 2015 ASR Agreement), which was completed in September 2015. Pursuant to the terms of the July 2015 ASR Agreement, a total of approximately 19.6 million shares of our common stock were repurchased at an aggregate cost to Caterpillar of $1.5 billion . For the year ended December 31, 2015, a total of 25.8 million shares of our common stock were repurchased at an aggregate cost to Caterpillar of $2.0 billion . We did not purchase any Caterpillar common stock during 2016. Through the end of 2016, approximately $4.5 billion of the $10.0 billion authorization was spent.  ##TABLE_START 17.

Fair value measurements ##TABLE_END  The guidance on fair value measurements defines fair value as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants. This guidance also specifies a fair value hierarchy based upon the observability of inputs used in valuation techniques. Observable inputs (highest level) reflect market data obtained from independent sources, while unobservable inputs (lowest level) reflect internally developed market assumptions. In accordance with this guidance, fair value measurements are classified under the following hierarchy:  ##TABLE_START  Level 1   Quoted prices for identical instruments in active markets. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  Level 2  Quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active; and model-derived valuations in which all significant inputs or significant value-drivers are observable in active markets. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  Level 3  Model-derived valuations in which one or more significant inputs or significant value-drivers are unobservable. ##TABLE_END  When available, we use quoted market prices to determine fair value, and we classify such measurements within Level 1. In some cases where market prices are not available, we make use of observable market based inputs to calculate fair value, in which case the measurements are classified within Level 2. If quoted or observable market prices are not available, fair value is based upon valuations in which one or more significant inputs are unobservable, including internally developed models that use, where possible, current market-based parameters such as interest rates, yield curves and currency rates. These measurements are classified within Level 3. Fair value measurements are classified according to the lowest level input or value-driver that is significant to the valuation. A measurement may therefore be classified within Level 3 even though there may be significant inputs that are readily observable.  Fair value measurement includes the consideration of nonperformance risk. Nonperformance risk refers to the risk that an obligation (either by a counterparty or Caterpillar) will not be fulfilled. For financial assets traded in an active market (Level 1 and certain Level 2), the nonperformance risk is included in the market price. For certain other financial assets and liabilities (certain Level 2 and Level 3), our fair value calculations have been adjusted accordingly.  Investments in debt and equity securities Investments in certain debt and equity securities, primarily at Insurance Services, have been classified as available-for-sale and recorded at fair value. Fair values for our U.S. treasury bonds and large capitalization value and smaller company growth equity securities are based upon valuations for identical instruments in active markets. Fair values for other government bonds, corporate bonds and mortgage-backed debt securities are based upon models that take into consideration such market-based factors as recent sales, risk-free yield curves and prices of similarly rated bonds. In addition, Insurance Services has an equity investment in a real estate investment trust (REIT) which is recorded at fair value based on the net asset value (NAV) of the investment. See Note 11 for additional information on our investments in debt and equity securities.  Derivative financial instruments The fair value of interest rate contracts is primarily based on models that utilize the appropriate market-based forward swap curves and zero-coupon interest rates to determine discounted cash flows. The fair value of foreign currency and commodity forward, option and cross currency contracts is based on a valuation model that discounts cash flows resulting from the differential between the contract price and the market-based forward rate. Assets and liabilities measured on a recurring basis at fair value, primarily related to Financial Products, included in Statement 3 as of December 31, 2016 and 2015 are summarized below: ##TABLE_START   December 31, 2016 (Millions of dollars)  Level 1  Level 2  Level 3  Total Assets / Liabilities, at Fair Value Assets         Available-for-sale securities         Government debt         U.S. treasury bonds  $  $   $   $ Other U.S. and non-U.S. government bonds                Corporate bonds         Corporate bonds       Asset-backed securities                Mortgage-backed debt securities         U.S. governmental agency       Residential       Commercial                Equity securities         Large capitalization value       Smaller company growth       Total available-for-sale securities      1,288          REIT       Derivative financial instruments, net         Total Assets  $  $  $  $ 1,367          Liabilities         Derivative financial instruments, net  $   $  $   $ Total Liabilities  $   $  $   $          ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START   December 31, 2015 (Millions of dollars)  Level 1  Level 2  Level 3  Total Assets / Liabilities, at Fair Value Assets         Available-for-sale securities         Government debt         U.S. treasury bonds  $  $   $   $ Other U.S. and non-U.S. government bonds                Corporate bonds         Corporate bonds       Asset-backed securities                Mortgage-backed debt securities         U.S. governmental agency       Residential       Commercial                Equity securities         Large capitalization value       Smaller company growth       Total available-for-sale securities   1,274    1,610          REIT       Derivative financial instruments, net       Total Assets  $  $ 1,323  $  $ 1,684          ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START          ##TABLE_ENDThe fair value of our REIT investment is measured based on NAV, which is considered a Level 3 input. A roll-forward of our REIT investment for the year ended December 31, 2016 is as follows: ##TABLE_START (Millions of dollars)   Balance at December 31, 2015  $ Purchases of securities  Sale of securities   Gains (losses) included in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss)  Balance at December 31, 2016  $    ##TABLE_END In addition to the amounts above, Cat Financial impaired loans are subject to measurement at fair value on a nonrecurring basis and are classified as Level 3 measurements. A loan is considered impaired when management determines that collection of contractual amounts due is not probable. In these cases, an allowance for credit losses may be established based either on the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the receivables' effective interest rate, or the fair value of the collateral for collateral-dependent receivables. In determining collateral value, Cat Financial estimates the current fair market value of the collateral less selling costs. Cat Financial had impaired loans with a fair value of $137 million and $91 million for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 , respectively.  ##TABLE_START B. Fair values of financial instruments ##TABLE_END  In addition to the methods and assumptions we use to record the fair value of financial instruments as discussed in the Fair value measurements section above, we used the following methods and assumptions to estimate the fair value of our financial instruments:  Cash and short-term investments Carrying amount approximated fair value.  Restricted cash and short-term investments Carrying amount approximated fair value. Restricted cash and short-term investments are included in Prepaid expenses and other current assets in Statement 3.  Finance receivables Fair value was estimated by discounting the future cash flows using current rates, representative of receivables with similar remaining maturities.  Wholesale inventory receivables Fair value was estimated by discounting the future cash flows using current rates, representative of receivables with similar remaining maturities.  Short-term borrowings Carrying amount approximated fair value.  Long-term debt Fair value for fixed and floating rate debt was estimated based on quoted market prices. Guarantees The fair value of guarantees is based upon our estimate of the premium a market participant would require to issue the same guarantee in a stand-alone arms-length transaction with an unrelated party. If quoted or observable market prices are not available, fair value is based upon internally developed models that utilize current market-based assumptions.  Please refer to the table below for the fair values of our financial instruments.  ##TABLE_START TABLE IIIFair Values of Financial Instruments        (Millions of dollars)  Carrying Amount  Fair Value  Carrying Amount  Fair Value  Fair Value Levels  Reference Assets at December 31,             Cash and short-term investments  $ 7,168  $ 7,168  $ 6,460  $ 6,460   Statement 3 Restricted cash and short-term investments       Statement 3 Investments in debt and equity securities  1,367  1,367  1,635  1,635  1, 2  3  Notes 11  19 Finance receivablesnet (excluding finance leases 1 )  16,172  16,056  16,515  16,551   Notes 6  19 Wholesale inventory receivablesnet (excluding finance leases 1 )  1,500  1,464  1,821  1,775   Notes 6  19 Foreign currency contractsnet         Notes 3  19 Interest rate swapsnet       Notes 3  19 Commodity contractsnet         Notes 3  19              Liabilities at December 31,             Short-term borrowings  7,303  7,303  6,967  6,967   Note 13 Long-term debt (including amounts due within one year):             Machinery, Energy  Transportation  8,943  10,348  9,477  10,691   Note 14 Financial Products  20,537  20,724  21,569  21,904   Note 14 Foreign currency contractsnet         Notes 3  19 Commodity contractsnet         Notes 3  19 Guarantees       Note 21 ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START 1  Total excluded items have a net carrying value at December 31, 2016 and 2015 of $6,111 million and $6,452 million , respectively. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START      ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START 19. Concentration of credit risk ##TABLE_END  Financial instruments with potential credit risk consist primarily of trade and finance receivables and short-term and long-term investments. Additionally, to a lesser extent, we have a potential credit risk associated with counterparties to derivative contracts.  Trade receivables are primarily short-term receivables from independently owned and operated dealers and customers which arise in the normal course of business. We perform regular credit evaluations of our dealers and customers. Collateral generally is not required, and the majority of our trade receivables are unsecured. We do, however, when deemed necessary, make use of various devices such as security agreements and letters of credit to protect our interests. No single dealer or customer represents a significant concentration of credit risk.  Finance receivables and wholesale inventory receivables primarily represent receivables under installment sales contracts, receivables arising from leasing transactions and notes receivable. We generally maintain a secured interest in the equipment financed. No single customer or dealer represents a significant concentration of credit risk.  Short-term and long-term investments are held with high quality institutions and, by policy, the amount of credit exposure to any one institution is limited. Long-term investments, primarily included in Other assets in Statement 3, are comprised primarily of available-for-sale securities at Insurance Services.  For derivative contracts, collateral is generally not required of the counterparties or of our company. The company generally enters into International Swaps and Derivatives Association (ISDA) master netting agreements within Machinery, Energy  Transportation and Financial Products that permit the net settlement of amounts owed under their respective derivative contracts. Our exposure to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the counterparties is limited to only those gains that we have recorded, but for which we have not yet received cash payment. The master netting agreements reduce the amount of loss the company would incur should the counterparties fail to meet their obligations. At December 31, 2016 and 2015 , the maximum exposure to credit loss was $96 million and $105 million , respectively, before the application of any master netting agreements. Please refer to Note 18 and Table III above for fair value information.  ##TABLE_START 20. Operating leases ##TABLE_END  We lease certain computer and communications equipment, transportation equipment and other property through operating leases. Total rental expense for operating leases was $375 million , $371 million and $391 million for 2016 , 2015 and 2014 , respectively.  Minimum payments for operating leases having initial or remaining non-cancelable terms in excess of one year are:  ##TABLE_START Years ended December 31, (Millions of dollars)      Thereafter  Total $  $  $  $  $  $  $              ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START 21. Guarantees and product warranty ##TABLE_END  Caterpillar dealer performance guarantees We have provided an indemnity to a third-party insurance company for potential losses related to performance bonds issued on behalf of Caterpillar dealers. The bonds have varying terms and are issued to insure governmental agencies against nonperformance by certain dealers. We also provided guarantees to third-parties related to the performance of contractual obligations by certain Caterpillar dealers. These guarantees have varying terms and cover potential financial losses incurred by the third-parties resulting from the dealers nonperformance. In 2016, we provided a guarantee to an end user related to the performance of contractual obligations by a Caterpillar dealer. Under the guarantee, which expires in 2025, non-performance by the Caterpillar dealer could require Caterpillar to satisfy the contractual obligations by providing goods, services or financial compensation to the end user up to an annual designated cap.  Customer loan guarantees We provide loan guarantees to third-party lenders for financing associated with machinery purchased by customers. These guarantees have varying terms and are secured by the machinery. In addition, Cat Financial participates in standby letters of credit issued to third parties on behalf of their customers. These standby letters of credit have varying terms and beneficiaries and are secured by customer assets. Supplier consortium performance guarantee We have provided a guarantee to one of our customers in Brazil related to the performance of contractual obligations by a supplier consortium to which one of our Caterpillar subsidiaries is a member. The guarantee covers potential damages (some of them capped) incurred by the customer resulting from the supplier consortiums non-performance. The guarantee will expire when the supplier consortium performs all its contractual obligations, which is expected to be completed in 2025. Third party logistics business lease guarantees We have provided guarantees to third-party lessors for certain properties leased by a third party logistics business, formerly Caterpillar Logistics Services LCC, in which we sold our 35 percent equity interest in the first quarter of 2015 (see Note 9). The guarantees are for the possibility that the third party logistics business would default on real estate lease payments. The guarantees were granted at lease inception and generally will expire at the end of the lease terms. Two dealer performance guarantees and a third party performance guarantee do not limit potential payment to end users related to indemnities and other commercial contractual obligations. For these unlimited guarantees, we are unable to estimate a maximum potential amount of future payments that could result from claims made. No significant loss has been experienced or is anticipated under any of these guarantees. At December 31, 2016 and 2015 , the related liability was $8 million and $12 million , respectively. The maximum potential amount of future payments (undiscounted and without reduction for any amounts that may possibly be recovered under recourse or collateralized provisions) we could be required to make under the guarantees at December 31 are as follows:  ##TABLE_START (Millions of dollars)   Caterpillar dealer performance guarantees  $ 1,384  $ Customer loan guarantees   Supplier consortium performance guarantee   Third party logistics business lease guarantees   Other guarantees   Total guarantees  $ 1,856  $      ##TABLE_END Cat Financial provides guarantees to repurchase certain loans of Caterpillar dealers from a special-purpose corporation (SPC) that qualifies as a variable interest entity. The purpose of the SPC is to provide short-term working capital loans to Caterpillar dealers. This SPC issues commercial paper and uses the proceeds to fund its loan program. Cat Financial has a loan purchase agreement with the SPC that obligates Cat Financial to purchase certain loans that are not paid at maturity. Cat Financial receives a fee for providing this guarantee, which provides a source of liquidity for the SPC. Cat Financial is the primary beneficiary of the SPC as its guarantees result in Cat Financial having both the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the SPCs economic performance and the obligation to absorb losses, and therefore Cat Financial has consolidated the financial statements of the SPC. As of December 31, 2016 and 2015 , the SPCs assets of $1,088 million and $1,211 million , respectively, were primarily comprised of loans to dealers, and the SPCs liabilities of $1,087 million and $1,210 million , respectively, were primarily comprised of commercial paper. The assets of the SPC are not available to pay Cat Financial's creditors. Cat Financial may be obligated to perform under the guarantee if the SPC experiences losses. No loss has been experienced or is anticipated under this loan purchase agreement.  Cat Financial is party to agreements in the normal course of business with selected customers and Caterpillar dealers in which they commit to provide a set dollar amount of financing on a pre-approved basis. They also provide lines of credit to certain customers and Caterpillar dealers, of which a portion remains unused as of the end of the period. Commitments and lines of credit generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses. It has been Cat Financial's experience that not all commitments and lines of credit will be used. Management applies the same credit policies when making commitments and granting lines of credit as it does for any other financing.  Cat Financial does not require collateral for these commitments/lines, but if credit is extended, collateral may be required upon funding. The amount of the unused commitments and lines of credit for dealers as of December 31, 2016 and 2015 was $12,775 million and $12,920 million , respectively. The amount of the unused commitments and lines of credit for customers as of December 31, 2016 and 2015 was $3,340 million and $3,567 million , respectively.  Our product warranty liability is determined by applying historical claim rate experience to the current field population and dealer inventory. Generally, historical claim rates are based on actual warranty experience for each product by machine model/engine size by customer or dealer location (inside or outside North America). Specific rates are developed for each product shipment month and are updated monthly based on actual warranty claim experience.  ##TABLE_START (Millions of dollars)    Warranty liability, January 1  $ 1,354  $ 1,426  Reduction in liability (payments)  (909 )  (874 )  Increase in liability (new warranties)    Warranty liability, December 31  $ 1,258  $ 1,354        ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START      ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START 22. Environmental and legal matters ##TABLE_END The Company is regulated by federal, state and international environmental laws governing our use, transport and disposal of substances and control of emissions. In addition to governing our manufacturing and other operations, these laws often impact the development of our products, including, but not limited to, required compliance with air emissions standards applicable to internal combustion engines. We have made, and will continue to make, significant research and development and capital expenditures to comply with these emissions standards. We are engaged in remedial activities at a number of locations, often with other companies, pursuant to federal and state laws. When it is probable we will pay remedial costs at a site, and those costs can be reasonably estimated, the investigation, remediation, and operating and maintenance costs are accrued against our earnings. Costs are accrued based on consideration of currently available data and information with respect to each individual site, including available technologies, current applicable laws and regulations, and prior remediation experience. Where no amount within a range of estimates is more likely, we accrue the minimum. Where multiple potentially responsible parties are involved, we consider our proportionate share of the probable costs. In formulating the estimate of probable costs, we do not consider amounts expected to be recovered from insurance companies or others. We reassess these accrued amounts on a quarterly basis. The amount recorded for environmental remediation is not material and is included in Accrued expenses. We believe there is no more than a remote chance that a material amount for remedial activities at any individual site, or at all the sites in the aggregate, will be required. On January 8, 2015, the Company received a grand jury subpoena from the U.S. District Court for the Central District of Illinois. The subpoena requests documents and information from the Company relating to, among other things, financial information concerning U.S. and non-U.S. Caterpillar subsidiaries (including undistributed profits of non-U.S. subsidiaries and the movement of cash among U.S. and non-U.S. subsidiaries). The Company has received additional subpoenas relating to this investigation requesting additional documents and information relating to, among other things, the purchase and resale of replacement parts by Caterpillar Inc. and non-U.S. Caterpillar subsidiaries, dividend distributions of certain non-U.S. Caterpillar subsidiaries, and Caterpillar SARL and related structures. The Company is cooperating with this investigation. The Company is unable to predict the outcome or reasonably estimate any potential loss; however, we currently believe that this matter will not have a material adverse effect on the Companys consolidated results of operations, financial position or liquidity. On September 10, 2014, the SEC issued to Caterpillar a subpoena seeking information concerning the Companys accounting for the goodwill relating to its acquisition of Bucyrus International Inc. in 2011 and related matters. The Company has received additional subpoenas relating to this investigation, and the Company is cooperating with the SEC regarding its ongoing investigation. The Company is unable to predict the outcome or reasonably estimate any potential loss; however, we currently believe that this matter will not have a material adverse effect on the Company's consolidated results of operations, financial position or liquidity. On March 20, 2014, Brazils Administrative Council for Economic Defense (CADE) published a Technical Opinion which named 18 companies and over 100 individuals as defendants, including two subsidiaries of Caterpillar Inc., MGE - Equipamentos e Servios Ferrovirios Ltda. (MGE) and Caterpillar Brasil Ltda. The publication of the Technical Opinion opened CADE's official administrative investigation into allegations that the defendants participated in anticompetitive bid activity for the construction and maintenance of metro and train networks in Brazil. While companies cannot be held criminally liable for anticompetitive conduct in Brazil, criminal charges have been brought against two current employees of MGE and one former employee of MGE involving the same conduct alleged by CADE. The Company has responded to all requests for information from the authorities. The Company is unable to predict the outcome or reasonably estimate the potential loss; however, we currently believe that this matter will not have a material adverse effect on the Company's consolidated results of operations, financial position or liquidity. On October 24, 2013, Progress Rail received a grand jury subpoena from the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California. The subpoena requests documents and information from Progress Rail, United Industries Corporation, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Progress Rail, and Caterpillar Inc. relating to allegations that Progress Rail conducted improper or unnecessary railcar inspections and repairs and improperly disposed of parts, equipment, tools and other items. In connection with this subpoena, Progress Rail was informed by the U.S. Attorney for the Central District of California that it is a target of a criminal investigation into potential violations of environmental laws and alleged improper business practices. The Company is cooperating with the authorities and is currently in discussions regarding a potential resolution of the matter. Although the Company believes a loss is probable, we currently believe that this matter will not have a material adverse effect on the Company's consolidated results of operations, financial position or liquidity. In addition, we are involved in other unresolved legal actions that arise in the normal course of business. The most prevalent of these unresolved actions involve disputes related to product design, manufacture and performance liability (including claimed asbestos and welding fumes exposure), contracts, employment issues, environmental matters or intellectual property rights. The aggregate range of reasonably possible losses in excess of accrued liabilities, if any, associated with these unresolved legal actions is not material. In some cases, we cannot reasonably estimate a range of loss because there is insufficient information regarding the matter. However, we believe there is no more than a remote chance that any liability arising from these matters would be material. Although it is not possible to predict with certainty the outcome of these unresolved legal actions, we believe that these actions will not individually or in the aggregate have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations, financial position or liquidity.  ##TABLE_START 23. Segment information ##TABLE_END  ##TABLE_START A. Basis for segment information ##TABLE_END  Our Executive Office is comprised of five Group Presidents, an Executive Vice President and a CEO. Group Presidents are accountable for a related set of end-to-end businesses that they manage. The Executive Vice President leads the Law and Public Policy Division. The CEO allocates resources and manages performance at the Group President level. As such, the CEO serves as our Chief Operating Decision Maker and operating segments are primarily based on the Group President reporting structure.  Three of our operating segments, Construction Industries, Resource Industries and Energy  Transportation are led by Group Presidents. One operating segment, Financial Products, is led by a Group President who also has responsibility for Corporate Services. Corporate Services is a cost center primarily responsible for the performance of certain support functions globally and to provide centralized services; it does not meet the definition of an operating segment. One Group President leads two smaller operating segments that are included in the All Other operating segments. The Law and Public Policy Division is a cost center and does not meet the definition of an operating segment. Effective January 1, 2016, we made the following changes to segment reporting. These changes were made to reflect changes in organizational accountabilities and refinements to our internal reporting. ##TABLE_START  Responsibility for remanufacturing of Cat engines and components and remanufacturing services for other companies moved from the All Other operating segments to Energy  Transportation. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Responsibility for business strategy, product management, development, manufacturing, marketing and product support for forestry and paving products moved from the All Other operating segments to Construction Industries. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Responsibility for business strategy, product management, development, manufacturing, marketing and product support for industrial and waste products moved from the All Other operating segments to Resource Industries. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Responsibility for sales and product support of on-highway vocational trucks for North America moved from the All Other operating segments to Energy  Transportation. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Internal charges for component manufacturing and logistics services provided by All Other operating segments to Construction Industries, Resource Industries and Energy  Transportation in excess of cost have been adjusted to approximate cost, resulting in a reduction in profit in the All Other operating segments and corresponding increases in profit in the other three segments. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Costs that previously had been included in Corporate costs, primarily for company-wide strategies such as information technology and manufacturing process transformation, have been included in the MET operating segments that benefit from the costs. ##TABLE_END Segment information for 2015 and 2014 has been retrospectively adjusted to conform to the 2016 presentation.  B.  Description of segments  We have six operating segments, of which four are reportable segments. Following is a brief description of our reportable segments and the business activities included in the All Other operating segments:  Construction Industries : A segment primarily responsible for supporting customers using machinery in infrastructure, forestry and building construction applications.

Financial Products Segment : Provides financing to customers and dealers for the purchase and lease of Cat and other equipment, as well as some financing for Caterpillar sales to dealers. Financing plans include operating and finance leases, installment sale contracts, working capital loans and wholesale financing plans. The segment also provides various forms of insurance to customers and dealers to help support the purchase and lease of our equipment.  All Other operating segments :  Primarily includes activities such as: the business strategy, product management and development, and manufacturing of filters and fluids, undercarriage, tires and rims, ground engaging tools, fluid transfer products, precision seals and rubber, and sealing and connecting components primarily for Cat products; parts distribution; distribution services responsible for dealer development and administration including a wholly-owned dealer in Japan, dealer portfolio management and ensuring the most efficient and effective distribution of machines, engines and parts; digital investments for new customer and dealer solutions that integrate data analytics with state-of-the art digital technologies while transforming the buying experience. Results for the All Other operating segments are included as a reconciling item between reportable segments and consolidated external reporting.  C.  Segment measurement and reconciliations  There are several methodology differences between our segment reporting and our external reporting. The following is a list of the more significant methodology differences:  ##TABLE_START  Machinery, Energy  Transportation segment net assets generally include inventories, receivables, property, plant and equipment, goodwill, intangibles, accounts payable, and customer advances. Liabilities other than accounts payable and customer advances are generally managed at the corporate level and are not included in segment operations. Financial Products Segment assets generally include all categories of assets. ##TABLE_END  ##TABLE_START  Segment inventories and cost of sales are valued using a current cost methodology. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  Goodwill allocated to segments is amortized using a fixed amount based on a 20 year useful life. This methodology difference only impacts segment assets; no goodwill amortization expense is included in segment profit. In addition, only a portion of goodwill for certain acquisitions made in 2011 or later has been allocated to segments. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  The present value of future lease payments for certain Machinery, Energy  Transportation operating leases is included in segment assets. The estimated financing component of the lease payments is excluded. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  Currency exposures for Machinery, Energy  Transportation are generally managed at the corporate level and the effects of changes in exchange rates on results of operations within the year are not included in segment profit. The net difference created in the translation of revenues and costs between exchange rates used for U.S. GAAP reporting and exchange rates used for segment reporting is recorded as a methodology difference. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  Stock-based compensation expense is not included in segment profit. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  Postretirement benefit expenses are split; segments are generally responsible for service and prior service costs, with the remaining elements of net periodic benefit cost included as a methodology difference. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  Machinery, Energy  Transportation segment profit is determined on a pretax basis and excludes interest expense and other income/expense items. Financial Products Segment profit is determined on a pretax basis and includes other income/expense items. ##TABLE_END Reconciling items are created based on accounting differences between segment reporting and our consolidated external reporting. Please refer to pages 146 to 151 for financial information regarding significant reconciling items. Most of our reconciling items are self-explanatory given the above explanations. For the reconciliation of profit, we have grouped the reconciling items as follows:  ##TABLE_START  Corporate costs: These costs are related to corporate requirements primarily for compliance and legal functions for the benefit of the entire organization. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  Restructuring costs: Primarily costs for employee separation costs, long-lived asset impairments and contract terminations. These costs are included in Other Operating (Income) Expenses. Restructuring costs also include other exit-related costs primarily for accelerated depreciation, equipment relocation, inventory write-downs, project management, and sales discounts and payments to dealers and customers related to discontinued products. A table, Reconciliation of Restructuring costs on page 148, has been included to illustrate how segment profit would have been impacted by the restructuring costs. See Note 25 for more information. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  Methodology differences: See previous discussion of significant accounting differences between segment reporting and consolidated external reporting. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  Timing: Timing differences in the recognition of costs between segment reporting and consolidated external reporting. For example, certain costs are reported on the cash basis for segment reporting and the accrual basis for consolidated external reporting. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START Segment Information (Millions of dollars) Reportable Segments:                 External sales and revenues  Inter- segment sales and revenues  Total sales and revenues  Depreciation and amortization 1  Segment profit  Segment assets at December 31  Capital expenditures               Construction Industries  $ 15,612  $  $ 15,690  $  $ 1,650  $ 5,367  $ Resource Industries  5,726   6,010   (1,047 )  7,135  Energy  Transportation  14,411  2,540  16,951   2,222  7,791  Machinery, Energy  Transportation  $ 35,749  $ 2,902  $ 38,651  $ 1,742  $ 2,825  $ 20,293  $ Financial Products Segment  2,993    2,993    35,224  1,638 Total  $ 38,742  $ 2,902  $ 41,644  $ 2,591  $ 3,527  $ 55,517  $ 2,586                              Construction Industries  $ 17,797  $  $ 17,906  $  $ 1,865  $ 6,176  $ Resource Industries  7,739   8,071    8,931  Energy  Transportation  18,519  2,877  21,396   3,390  8,769  Machinery, Energy  Transportation  $ 44,055  $ 3,318  $ 47,373  $ 1,838  $ 5,256  $ 23,876  $ 1,448 Financial Products Segment  3,078    3,078    35,729  1,465 Total  $ 47,133  $ 3,318  $ 50,451  $ 2,686  $ 6,065  $ 59,605  $ 2,913                              Construction Industries  $ 20,590  $  $ 20,714  $  $ 2,133  $ 7,342  $ Resource Industries  9,134   9,562    9,854  Energy  Transportation  22,306  3,386  25,692   4,287  8,661  Machinery, Energy  Transportation  $ 52,030  $ 3,938  $ 55,968  $ 1,952  $ 6,985  $ 25,857  $ 1,393 Financial Products Segment  3,313    3,313    36,969  1,634 Total  $ 55,343  $ 3,938  $ 59,281  $ 2,837  $ 7,886  $ 62,826  $ 3,027                ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START 1  We revised previously reported depreciation and amortization for Construction Industries and Resource Industries. Depreciation and amortization decreased for Construction Industries and increased for Resource Industries by $58 million and $35 million in 2015 and 2014, respectively. The revision did not impact segment profit. Management has concluded that the impact was not material to any period presented. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START Reconciliation of Sales and Revenues:          (Millions of dollars)  Machinery, Energy  Transportation  Financial Products  Consolidating Adjustments  Consolidated Total         Total external sales and revenues from reportable segments  $ 35,749  $ 2,993  $   $ 38,742 All Other operating segments       Other  (115 )   (301 ) 1  (344 ) Total sales and revenues  $ 35,773  $ 3,065  $ (301 )  $ 38,537                  Total external sales and revenues from reportable segments  $ 44,055  $ 3,078  $   $ 47,133 All Other operating segments       Other  (111 )   (315 ) 1  (325 ) Total sales and revenues  $ 44,147  $ 3,179  $ (315 )  $ 47,011                  Total external sales and revenues from reportable segments  $ 52,030  $ 3,313  $   $ 55,343 All Other operating segments       Other  (124 )   (344 ) 1  (395 ) Total sales and revenues  $ 52,142  $ 3,386  $ (344 )  $ 55,184 ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START 1  Elimination of Financial Products revenues from Machinery, Energy  Transportation. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START      ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START Reconciliation of consolidated profit before taxes:       (Millions of dollars)  Machinery, Energy  Transportation  Financial Products  Consolidated Total       Total profit from reportable segments  $ 2,825  $  $ 3,527 All Other operating segments  (77 )    (77 ) Cost centers     Corporate costs  (527 )    (527 ) Timing     Restructuring costs  (1,014 )  (5 )  (1,019 ) Methodology differences:      Inventory/cost of sales       Postretirement benefit expense  (788 )    (788 ) Stock-based compensation expense  (209 )  (9 )  (218 ) Financing costs  (517 )    (517 ) Currency  (22 )    (22 ) Other income/expense methodology differences  (225 )    (225 ) Other methodology differences  (47 )   (43 ) Total consolidated profit before taxes  $ (553 )  $  $              Total profit from reportable segments  $ 5,256  $  $ 6,065 All Other operating segments  (75 )    (75 ) Cost centers     Corporate costs  (600 )    (600 ) Timing     Restructuring costs  (881 )  (17 )  (898 ) Methodology differences:       Inventory/cost of sales  (100 )    (100 ) Postretirement benefit expense     Stock-based compensation expense  (270 )  (13 )  (283 ) Financing costs  (524 )    (524 ) Currency  (261 )    (261 ) Other income/expense methodology differences  (95 )    (95 ) Other methodology differences  (79 )   (36 ) Total consolidated profit before taxes  $ 2,617  $  $ 3,439              Total profit from reportable segments  $ 6,985  $  $ 7,886 All Other operating segments     Cost centers  (12 )    (12 ) Corporate costs  (674 )    (674 ) Timing  (245 )    (245 ) Restructuring costs  (432 )    (432 ) Methodology differences:       Inventory/cost of sales     Postretirement benefit expense  (2,434 )    (2,434 ) Stock-based compensation expense  (242 )  (12 )  (254 ) Financing costs  (502 )    (502 ) Currency     Other income/expense methodology differences  (249 )    (249 ) Other methodology differences  (57 )   (37 ) Total consolidated profit before taxes  $ 2,243  $  $ 3,152        ##TABLE_ENDReconciliation of Restructuring costs: As noted above, restructuring costs are a reconciling item between Segment profit and Consolidated profit before taxes.

On December 15, 2016, we acquired 100 percent of the equity in privately held Kemper Valve  Fittings Corp. (Kemper). Kemper is headquartered in Island Lake, Illinois and designs, manufactures, sells, and services high pressure flow iron to the well service segment of the Oil  Gas industry. This acquisition will provide Caterpillar with a new product offering which will complement its existing products in the Oil  Gas industry. The purchase price, net of $10 million of acquired cash, consisted of $94 million paid at closing, which includes a preliminary net working capital adjustment of $2 million anticipated to be finalized in the first quarter of 2017 and $8 million payable in 2018. In addition, there is contingent consideration with a fair value of $39 million which is comprised of two components: 1) our expected use of a charitable contribution carry forward for U.S. tax purposes acquired from Kemper which has an estimated maximum payment of $20 million and 2) a specified industry performance index price target during the period from January 1, 2017 to December 31, 2021 which is capped at $20 million per year. The contingent consideration will be remeasured each reporting period at its estimated fair value with any adjustment included in Other operating (income) expenses in Statement 1. The transaction was financed with available cash. Tangible assets as of the acquisition date were $138 million , recorded at their fair values, and included cash of $10 million , receivables of $7 million , net deferred tax assets of $23 million , inventories of $56 million , and property, plant and equipment of $42 million . Finite-lived intangible assets acquired of $4 million included developed technology and trade names. The finite lived intangible assets are being amortized on a straight-line basis over an amortization period of 10 years . Liabilities assumed as of the acquisition date were $3 million , which represented their fair values. Goodwill of $12 million , non-deductible for income tax purposes, represented the excess of the consideration transferred over the net assets recognized and represented the estimated future economic benefits arising from other assets acquired that could not be individually identified and separately recognized. Factors that contributed to a purchase price resulting in the recognition of goodwill include Kempers strategic fit into our product portfolio, the opportunity to provide a complete line-up of high value products performing pressure pumping, and the acquired assembled workforce. These values represent a preliminary allocation of purchase price subject to finalization of post-closing procedures. The results of the acquired business for the period from the acquisition date are included in the accompanying consolidated financial statements and reported in the Energy  Transportation segment in Note 23. Assuming this transaction had been made at the beginning of any period presented, the consolidated pro forma results would not be materially different from reported results. RDS Manufacturing, Inc. In December 2015, we acquired 100 percent of the stock of RDS Manufacturing, Inc. (RDS). RDS, located in Broken Arrow, Oklahoma, is a privately owned manufacturer of highly engineered turbomachinery parts, primarily for the turbine engine and aerospace markets. The acquisition of RDS is expected to help grow our turbine business and deepen our manufacturing expertise. The purchase price, net of $1 million of acquired cash and $5 million of trade receivables due from Caterpillar, was approximately $85 million . We paid $74 million at closing with an additional $11 million to be paid in December 2017. The transaction was financed with available cash. Tangible assets acquired of $28 million , recorded at their fair values, were primarily inventories of $12 million and property, plant and equipment of $16 million . Liabilities assumed as of the acquisition date were $2 million , which represented their fair values. Goodwill of $59 million , substantially all of which is deductible for income tax purposes, represented the excess of the consideration transferred over the net assets recognized and represented the estimated future economic benefits arising from other assets acquired that could not be individually identified and separately recognized. Factors that contributed to a purchase price resulting in the recognition of goodwill include RDSs strategic fit into our manufacturing and product portfolio and the acquired assembled workforce. The results of the acquired business for the period from the acquisition date are included in the accompanying consolidated financial statements and are reported in the Energy  Transportation segment. Assuming this transaction had been made at the beginning of any period presented, the consolidated pro forma results would not be materially different from reported results. Rail Product Solutions, Inc. In October 2015, we acquired 100 percent of the stock in privately owned Rail Product Solutions, Inc. (RPS) from Amsted Rail Company, Inc. RPS is a leading North American provider of mission critical track fastening products and integrated fastening systems. The acquisition of RPS expands our portfolio of track related products and allows us to provide more comprehensive solutions to our customers. The purchase price was $165 million . The transaction was financed with available cash. Tangible assets acquired of $41 million , recorded at their fair values, were primarily receivables of $9 million , inventories of $6 million , property, plant and equipment of $17 million and an investment in an unconsolidated affiliated company of $9 million . Finite-lived intangible assets acquired of $82 million were primarily customer relationships and are being amortized on a straight-line basis over a weighted average period of approximately 15 years . Liabilities assumed as of the acquisition date were $11 million , which represented their fair values. Goodwill of $53 million , substantially all of which is deductible for income tax purposes, represented the excess of the consideration transferred over the net assets recognized and represented the estimated future economic benefits arising from other assets acquired that could not be individually identified and separately recognized. Factors that contributed to a purchase price resulting in the recognition of goodwill include RPSs strategic fit into our product and services portfolio and the acquired assembled workforce. The results of the acquired business for the period from the acquisition date are included in the accompanying consolidated financial statements and are reported in the Energy  Transportation segment. Assuming this transaction had been made at the beginning of any period presented, the consolidated pro forma results would not be materially different from reported results. 25. Restructuring costs  Our accounting for employee separations is dependent upon how the particular program is designed. For voluntary programs, eligible separation costs are recognized at the time of employee acceptance unless the acceptance requires explicit approval by the Company. For involuntary programs, eligible costs are recognized when management has approved the program, the affected employees have been properly notified and the costs are estimable. Restructuring costs for 2016, 2015 and 2014 were as follows: ##TABLE_START        (Millions of dollars)    Employee separations 1  $  $  $ Contract terminations 1      Long-lived asset impairments 1    Defined benefit retirement plan curtailment losses 1    Other 2     Total restructuring costs  $ 1,019  $  $        1 Recognized in Other operating (income) expenses.       2 Represents costs related to our restructuring programs, primarily for inventory write-downs, accelerated depreciation, sales discounts, project management and equipment relocation and were recognized primarily in Cost of goods sold.        ##TABLE_ENDThe restructuring costs in 2016 were primarily related to actions in Resource Industries in response to continued weakness in the mining industry. In addition, costs resulted from our decision to discontinue production of on-highway vocational trucks within Energy  Transportation and other restructuring actions across the company, most of which were related to our September 2015 announcement regarding significant restructuring and cost reduction actions to lower our operating costs in response to weak economic and business conditions in most of the industries we serve. The restructuring costs in 2015 were primarily related to several restructuring programs across the company. The restructuring costs in 2014 were primarily related to a reduction in workforce at our Gosselies, Belgium, facility. Restructuring costs are a reconciling item between Segment profit and Consolidated profit before taxes. See Note 23 for more information. The following table summarizes the 2015 and 2016 employee separation activity: ##TABLE_START (Millions of dollars)  Liability balance at December 31, 2014 $ Increase in liability (separation charges) Reduction in liability (payments) (340 ) Liability balance at December 31, 2015 $ Increase in liability (separation charges) Reduction in liability (payments) (633 ) Liability balance at December 31, 2016 $   ##TABLE_END As part of our September 2015 announcement, we offered a voluntary retirement enhancement program to qualifying U.S. employees and various voluntary separation programs outside of the U.S. and implemented additional involuntary separation programs throughout the company. In 2016 and 2015, we incurred $100 million and $379 million of employee separation costs related to these programs, respectively. In addition, in 2015 we incurred $82 million of defined benefit retirement plan curtailment losses related to these programs. Substantially all of the employee separation costs related to this program were paid in 2016. We also incurred costs associated with the September 2015 announcement related to manufacturing facility consolidations and closures in 2016 and 2015 totaling $181 million and $108 million , respectively. The remaining liability balance as of December 31, 2016 represents costs for other employee separation programs, most of which are expected to be paid in 2017. In February 2016, we made the decision to discontinue production of on-highway vocational trucks. Based on the business climate in the truck industry and a thorough evaluation of the business, the company decided it would withdraw from this market. We estimate restructuring costs incurred under the restructuring plan to be $110 million . In 2016, we recognized $104 million of restructuring costs primarily for long-lived asset impairments and sales discounts related to this restructuring plan. The remaining costs are expected to be recognized in 2017. In the second half of 2016, we took additional restructuring actions in Resource Industries, including ending the production of track drills; pursuing strategic alternatives, including the possible divestiture of room and pillar products; consolidation of two product development divisions; and additional actions in response to ongoing weakness in the mining industry. We estimate restructuring costs incurred under these restructuring plans to be $385 million . For the year ended December 31, 2016, we incurred $369 million of restructuring costs related to these plans which included $164 million of long-lived asset impairments, $120 million of employee separation costs, $81 million of inventory write-downs and $4 million of other costs. The remaining costs are expected to be recognized in 2017. 26.

Based on that evaluation, the CEO and CFO concluded that the company's disclosure controls and procedures are effective as of the end of the period covered by this annual report.  Managements Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting The management of Caterpillar Inc. (company) is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act. Our internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of our financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Our internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.  Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.  Management assessed the effectiveness of the companys internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2016 . In making this assessment, we used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework (2013). Based on our assessment we concluded that, as of December 31, 2016 , the companys internal control over financial reporting was effective based on those criteria. The effectiveness of the companys internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2016 has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm. Their report appears on page 69 of Part II, Item 8 \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\" Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting  During the last fiscal quarter, there has been no significant change in the companys internal control over financial reporting that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the companys internal control over financial reporting. ##TABLE_START ", "9B": " Item 9B.

Business. ##TABLE_END General  Originally organized as Caterpillar Tractor Co. in 1925 in the State of California, our company was reorganized as Caterpillar Inc. in 1986 in the State of Delaware. As used herein, the term Caterpillar, we, us, our or the company refers to Caterpillar Inc. and its subsidiaries unless designated or identified otherwise.  Overview  With 2017 sales and revenues of $45.462 billion , Caterpillar is the worlds leading manufacturer of construction and mining equipment, diesel and natural gas engines, industrial gas turbines and diesel-electric locomotives. The company principally operates through its three primary segments - Construction Industries, Resource Industries and Energy  Transportation - and also provides financing and related services through its Financial Products segment. Caterpillar is also a leading U.S. exporter. Through a global network of independent dealers and direct sales of certain products, Caterpillar builds long-term relationships with customers around the world.  Currently, we have six operating segments, of which four are reportable segments and are described below. Further information about our reportable segments, including geographic information, appears in Note 23  Segment information of Part II, Item 8 \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\"  Categories of Business Organization  1.   Machinery, Energy  Transportation  Represents the aggregate total of Construction Industries, Resource Industries, Energy  Transportation and All Other operating segments and related corporate items and eliminations.  2.   Financial Products  Primarily includes the companys Financial Products Segment. This category includes Caterpillar Financial Services Corporation (Cat Financial), Caterpillar Insurance Holdings Inc. (Insurance Services) and their respective subsidiaries.  Other information about our operations in 2017 , including certain risks associated with our operations, is included in Part II, Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.  Construction Industries  Our Construction Industries segment is primarily responsible for supporting customers using machinery in infrastructure, forestry and building construction. The majority of machine sales in this segment are made in the heavy and general construction, rental, quarry and aggregates markets and mining.  Nature of customer demand for construction machinery varies around the world. Customers in developing economies often prioritize purchase price in making their investment decisions, while customers in developed economies generally weigh productivity and other performance criteria that contribute to lower owning and operating costs over the lifetime of the machine. To meet customer expectations in developing economies, Caterpillar developed differentiated product offerings that target customers in those markets, including our SEM brand machines. We believe that these customer-driven product innovations enable us to compete more effectively in developing economies. The majority of Construction Industries' research and development spending in 2017 focused on the next generation of construction machines.  The competitive environment for construction machinery is characterized by some global competitors and many regional and specialized local competitors. Examples of global competitors include Komatsu Ltd., Volvo Construction Equipment (part of the Volvo Group), CNH Industrial N.V., Deere  Company, Hitachi Construction Machinery Co., Ltd., J.C. Bamford Excavators Ltd., Doosan Infracore Co., Ltd., Hyundai Construction Equipment Co., Ltd. and Kubota Farm  Industrial Machinery (part of Kubota Corporation). As an example of regional and local competitors, our competitors in China also include Guangxi LiuGong Machinery Co., Ltd., Longking Holdings Ltd., Sany Heavy Industry Co., Ltd., XCMG Group, Shantui Construction Machinery Co., Ltd., (part of Shandong Heavy Industry Group Co.) and Shandong Lingong Construction Machinery Co., Ltd. (SDLG, part of Volvo Group). Each of these companies has varying product lines that compete with Caterpillar products, and each has varying degrees of regional focus.  The Construction Industries product portfolio includes the following machines and related parts and work tools:  ##TABLE_START    asphalt pavers   feller bunchers   telehandlers   backhoe loaders    harvesters   small and medium   compactors    knuckleboom loaders   track-type tractors   cold planers    motorgraders    track-type loaders  compact truck and   pipelayers    wheel excavators  multi-terrain loaders   road reclaimers   compact, small and   mini, small, medium   site prep tractors   medium wheel loaders   and large excavators   skidders     forestry excavators   skid steer loaders   ##TABLE_ENDResource Industries  The Resource Industries segment is primarily responsible for supporting customers using machinery in mining, quarry, waste and material handling applications. Caterpillar offers a broad product range and services to deliver comprehensive solutions for our mining customers. We manufacture high productivity equipment for both surface and underground mining operations around the world. Our equipment is used to extract and haul copper, iron ore, coal, oil sands, aggregates, gold and other minerals and ores. In addition to equipment, Resource Industries also develops and sells technology products and services to provide customers fleet management systems, equipment management analytics and autonomous machine capabilities. Customers in most markets place an emphasis on equipment that is highly productive, reliable and provides the lowest total cost of ownership over the life of the equipment. In some developing markets, customers often prioritize purchase price in making their investment decisions. We believe our ability to control the integration and design of key machine components represents a competitive advantage. Our research and development efforts remain focused on providing mining and quarry customers the lowest total cost of ownership enabled through the highest quality, most productive products in the industry. The competitive environment for Resource Industries consists of a few larger global competitors that compete in several of the markets that we serve and a substantial number of smaller companies that compete in a more limited range of products, applications, and regional markets. Our global surface competitors include Komatsu Ltd., Hitachi Construction Machinery Co., Ltd., Volvo Construction Equipment, Atlas Copco AB, Deere  Company, Sandvik AB and Liebherr-International AG. Our global underground competitors include Atlas Copco AB, Liebherr-International AG, Sandvik AB, Komatsu Ltd., and Zhengzhou Coal Mining Machinery Group Co., Ltd. The Resource Industries product portfolio includes the following machines and related parts:  ##TABLE_START   electric rope shovels    longwall miners    landfill compactors   draglines    large wheel loaders    soil compactors   hydraulic shovels    off-highway trucks    machinery components   rotary drills    articulated trucks    electronics and control systems   hard rock vehicles    wheel tractor scrapers    select work tools   large track-type tractors    wheel dozers    hard rock continuous mining systems   large mining trucks     ##TABLE_END Energy  Transportation  Our Energy  Transportation segment supports customers in oil and gas, power generation, marine, rail and industrial applications, including Cat machines. The product and services portfolio includes reciprocating engines, generator sets, marine propulsion systems, gas turbines and turbine-related services, the remanufacturing of Cat engines and components and remanufacturing services for other companies, diesel-electric locomotives and other rail-related products and services and product support of on-highway vocational trucks for North America.  Regulatory emissions standards of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and comparable standards in other developed economies have required us to make significant investments in research and development that will continue as new products and similar regulations are introduced over the next several years. We believe that our emissions technology provides a competitive advantage in connection with emissions standards compliance and performance.  The competitive environment for reciprocating engines in marine, oil and gas, industrial and electric power generation systems along with turbines in oil and gas and electric power generation consists of a few larger global competitors that compete in a variety of markets that Caterpillar serves, and a substantial number of smaller companies that compete in a limited-size product range, geographic region and/or application. Principal global competitors include Cummins Inc., Rolls-Royce Power Systems, GE Power, Siemens Power and Gas, Deutz AG and Wrtsil Corp. Other competitors, such as MAN Diesel  Turbo SE, Baker Hughes, a GE company, Rolls-Royce Marine, Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Ltd., Volvo Penta, Weichai Power Co., Ltd., Kirloskar Oil Engines Limited and other emerging market competitors compete in certain markets in which Caterpillar competes. An additional set of competitors, including Generac Power Systems, Inc., Kohler Co., Inc., Aggreko plc and others, are primarily packagers who source engines and/or other components from domestic and international suppliers and market products regionally and internationally through a variety of distribution channels. In rail-related businesses, our global competitors include GE Transportation, Vossloh AG, Siemens Akteingesellschaft, Alstom Transport SA, and Voestalpine AG. We also compete with other companies on a more limited range of products, services and/or geographic regions. The Energy  Transportation portfolio includes the following products and related parts: ##TABLE_START  reciprocating engine powered generator sets ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  reciprocating engines supplied to the industrial industry as well as Caterpillar machinery ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  integrated systems used in the electric power generation industry ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  turbines, centrifugal gas compressors and related services ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  reciprocating engines and integrated systems and solutions for the marine and oil and gas industries ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  remanufactured reciprocating engines and components ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  diesel-electric locomotives and components and other rail-related products and services ##TABLE_END Financial Products Segment  The business of our Financial Products segment is primarily conducted by Cat Financial, a wholly owned finance subsidiary of Caterpillar. Cat Financials primary business is to provide retail and wholesale financing alternatives for Caterpillar products to customers and dealers around the world. Retail financing is primarily comprised of the financing of Caterpillar equipment, machinery and engines. Cat Financial also provides financing for vehicles, power generation facilities and marine vessels that, in most cases, incorporate Caterpillar products. In addition to retail financing, Cat Financial provides wholesale financing to Caterpillar dealers and purchases short-term trade receivables from Caterpillar and its subsidiaries. The various financing plans offered by Cat Financial are primarily designed to increase the opportunity for sales of Caterpillar products and generate financing income for Cat Financial. A significant portion of Cat Financials activity is conducted in North America, with additional offices and subsidiaries in Latin America, Asia/Pacific, Europe, Africa and Middle East.  For over 35 years, Cat Financial has been providing financing in the various markets in which it participates, contributing to its knowledge of asset values, industry trends, product structuring and customer needs.  In certain instances, Cat Financials operations are subject to supervision and regulation by state, federal and various foreign governmental authorities, and may be subject to various laws and judicial and administrative decisions imposing various requirements and restrictions which, among other things, (i) regulate credit granting activities and the administration of loans, (ii) establish maximum interest rates, finance charges and other charges, (iii) require disclosures to customers and investors, (iv) govern secured transactions, (v) set collection, foreclosure, repossession and other trade practices and (vi) regulate the use and reporting of information related to a borrowers credit experience. Cat Financials ability to comply with these and other governmental and legal requirements and restrictions affects its operations. Cat Financials retail leases and installment sale contracts (totaling 56 percent*) include:  ##TABLE_START  Tax leases that are classified as either operating or finance leases for financial accounting purposes, depending on the characteristics of the lease. For tax purposes, Cat Financial is considered the owner of the equipment (12 percent*). ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  Finance (non-tax) leases, where the lessee for tax purposes is considered to be the owner of the equipment during the term of the lease, that either require or allow the customer to purchase the equipment for a fixed price at the end of the term (21 percent*). ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Installment sale contracts, which are equipment loans that enable customers to purchase equipment with a down payment or trade-in and structure payments over time (22 percent*). ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  Governmental lease-purchase plans in the U.S. that offer low interest rates and flexible terms to qualified non-federal government agencies (1 percent*). ##TABLE_END  Cat Financials wholesale notes receivable, finance leases and installment sale contracts (totaling 14 percent*) include:  ##TABLE_START  Inventory/rental programs, which provide assistance to dealers by financing their new Caterpillar inventory and rental fleets (3 percent*). ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  Short-term receivables Cat Financial purchased from Caterpillar at a discount (11 percent*). ##TABLE_END  Cat Financials retail notes receivables (30 percent*) include:  ##TABLE_START  Loans that allow customers and dealers to use their Caterpillar equipment or other assets as collateral to obtain financing. ##TABLE_END *Indicates the percentage of Cat Financials total portfolio at December 31, 2017. We define total portfolio as total finance receivables (net of unearned income and allowance for credit losses) plus equipment on operating leases, less accumulated depreciation. For more information on the above and Cat Financials concentration of credit risk, please refer to Note 6  Cat Financial Financing Activities of Part II, Item 8 \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\" _____________________________  Cat Financial operates in a highly competitive environment, with financing for users of Caterpillar equipment available through a variety of sources, principally commercial banks and finance and leasing companies. Cat Financials competitors include Wells Fargo Equipment Finance Inc. and various other banks and finance companies. In addition, many of our manufacturing competitors own financial subsidiaries, such as Volvo Financial Services, Komatsu Financial L.P. and John Deere Capital Corporation, that utilize below-market interest rate programs (funded by the manufacturer) to assist machine sales. Caterpillar and Cat Financial work together to provide a broad array of financial merchandising programs around the world to meet these competitive offers.  Cat Financials financial results are largely dependent upon the ability of Caterpillar dealers to sell equipment and customers willingness to enter into financing or leasing agreements. It is also affected by, among other things, the availability of funds from its financing sources, general economic conditions such as inflation and market interest rates and its cost of funds relative to its competitors.  Cat Financial has a match-funding policy that addresses interest rate risk by aligning the interest rate profile (fixed or floating rate) of its debt portfolio with the interest rate profile of its receivables portfolio within predetermined ranges on an ongoing basis. In connection with that policy, Cat Financial uses interest rate derivative instruments to modify the debt structure to match assets within the receivables portfolio. This matched funding reduces the volatility of margins between interest-bearing assets and interest-bearing liabilities, regardless of which direction interest rates move. For more information regarding match funding, please see Note 3  Derivative financial instruments and risk management of Part II, Item 8 \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\" See also the risk factors associated with our financial products business included in Item 1 A. of this Form 10-K. In managing foreign currency risk for Cat Financials operations, the objective is to minimize earnings volatility resulting from conversion and the remeasurement of net foreign currency balance sheet positions, and future transactions denominated in foreign currencies. This policy allows the use of foreign currency forward, option and cross currency contracts to offset the risk of currency mismatch between the receivable and debt portfolios, and exchange rate risk associated with future transactions denominated in foreign currencies.  Cat Financial provides financing only when certain criteria are met. Credit decisions are based on a variety of credit quality factors including prior payment experience, customer financial information, credit-rating agency ratings, loan-to-value ratios and other internal metrics. Cat Financial typically maintains a security interest in retail-financed equipment and requires physical damage insurance coverage on financed equipment. Cat Financial finances a significant portion of Caterpillar dealers sales and inventory of Caterpillar equipment throughout the world. Cat Financials competitive position is improved by marketing programs offered in conjunction with Caterpillar and/or Caterpillar dealers. Under these programs, Caterpillar, or the dealer, funds an amount at the outset of the transaction, which Cat Financial then recognizes as revenue over the term of the financing. We believe that these marketing programs provide Cat Financial a significant competitive advantage in financing Caterpillar products.

In all markets, we compete on the basis of product performance, customer service, quality and price. From time to time, the intensity of competition results in price discounting in a particular industry or region. Such price discounting puts pressure on margins and can negatively impact operating profit. Outside the United States, certain competitors enjoy competitive advantages inherent to operating in their home countries or regions.  Raw Materials and Component Products  We source our raw materials and manufactured components from suppliers both domestically and internationally. These purchases include unformed materials and rough and finished parts. Unformed materials include a variety of steel products, which are then cut or formed to shape and machined in our facilities. Rough parts include various sized steel and iron castings and forgings, which are machined to final specification levels inside our facilities. Finished parts are ready to assemble components, which are made either to Caterpillar specifications or to supplier developed specifications. We machine and assemble some of the components used in our machines, engines and power generation units and to support our after-market dealer parts sales. We also purchase various goods and services used in production, logistics, offices and product development processes. We maintain global strategic sourcing models to meet our global facilities production needs while building long-term supplier relationships and leveraging enterprise spend. We expect our suppliers to maintain, at all times, industry-leading levels of quality and the ability to timely deliver raw materials and component products for our machine and engine products. However, increases in demand have led to parts and components constraints across some products. We use a variety of agreements with suppliers to protect our intellectual property and processes to monitor and mitigate risks of the supply base causing a business disruption. The risks monitored include supplier financial viability, the ability to increase or decrease production levels, business continuity, quality and delivery.  Patents and Trademarks  We own a number of patents and trademarks, which have been obtained over a period of years and relate to the products we manufacture and the services we provide. These patents and trademarks are generally considered beneficial to our business. We do not regard our business as being dependent upon any single patent or group of patents. Order Backlog  The dollar amount of backlog believed to be firm was approximately $15.8 billion at December 31, 2017 and $12.1 billion at December 31, 2016 . Compared with year-end 2016 , the order backlog increased about $3.7 billion. The increase was across all segments, most significantly in Resource Industries and Construction Industries. Of the total backlog at December 31, 2017 , approximately $2.9 billion was not expected to be filled in 2018 . Dealers and Distributors  Our machines are distributed principally through a worldwide organization of dealers (dealer network), 48 located in the United States and 123 located outside the United States, serving 192 countries. Reciprocating engines are sold principally through the dealer network and to other manufacturers for use in products. Some of the reciprocating engines manufactured by our subsidiary Perkins Engines Company Limited, are also sold through its worldwide network of 93 distributors covering 182 countries. The FG Wilson branded electric power generation systems primarily manufactured by our subsidiary Caterpillar Northern Ireland Limited are sold through its worldwide network of 154 distributors covering 131 countries. Some of the large, medium speed reciprocating engines are also sold under the MaK brand through a worldwide network of 20 distributors covering 130 countries.  Our dealers do not deal exclusively with our products; however, in most cases sales and servicing of our products are the dealers principal business. Some products, primarily turbines and locomotives, are sold directly to end customers through sales forces employed by the company. At times, these employees are assisted by independent sales representatives. While the large majority of our worldwide dealers are independently owned and operated, we own and operate a dealership in Japan that covers approximately 80% of the Japanese market: Nippon Caterpillar Division. We are currently operating this Japanese dealer directly and its results are reported in the All Other operating segments. There are also three independent dealers in the Southern Region of Japan.  For Caterpillar branded products, the companys relationship with each of its independent dealers is memorialized in standard sales and service agreements. Pursuant to this agreement, the company grants the dealer the right to purchase and sell its products and to service the products in a specified geographic service territory. Prices to dealers are established by the company after receiving input from dealers on transactional pricing in the marketplace. The company also agrees to defend its intellectual property and to provide warranty and technical support to the dealer. The agreement further grants the dealer a non-exclusive license to use the companys trademarks, service marks and brand names. In some instances, a separate trademark agreement exists between the company and a dealer.  In exchange for these rights, the agreement obligates the dealer to develop and promote the sale of the companys products to current and prospective customers in the dealers service territory. Each dealer agrees to employ adequate sales and support personnel to market, sell and promote the companys products, demonstrate and exhibit the products, perform the companys product improvement programs, inform the company concerning any features that might affect the safe operation of any of the companys products and maintain detailed books and records of the dealers financial condition, sales and inventories and make these books and records available at the companys reasonable request.  These sales and service agreements are terminable at will by either party primarily upon 90 days written notice.  Research and Development  We place strong emphasis on product-oriented research and development relating to the development of new or improved machines, engines and major components. In 2017 , 2016 and 2015 , we spent $1,905 million, $1,951 million and $2,119 million, or 4.2, 5.1 and 4.5 percent of our sales and revenues, respectively, on our research and development programs.  Employment  As of December 31, 2017 , we employed about 98,400 full-time persons of whom approximately 56,200 were located outside the United States. In the United States, we employed approximately 42,200 employees, most of whom are at-will employees and, therefore, not subject to any type of employment contract or agreement. At select business units, certain highly specialized employees have been hired under employment contracts that specify a term of employment, pay and other benefits.  ##TABLE_START Full-Time Employees at Year-End      Inside U.S. 42,200  40,900 Outside U.S. 56,200  54,500 Total 98,400  95,400     By Region:    North America 42,400  41,200 EAME 18,100  20,000 Latin America 15,000  11,400 Asia/Pacific 22,900  22,800 Total 98,400  95,400     ##TABLE_ENDAs of December 31, 2017 , there were approximately 8,740 U.S. hourly production employees who were covered by collective bargaining agreements with various labor unions, including The United Automobile, Aerospace and Agricultural Implement Workers of America (UAW), The International Association of Machinists and The United Steelworkers. Approximately 7,030 of such employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements with the UAW that expire on December 17, 2018 and March 1, 2023. Outside the United States, the company enters into employment contracts and agreements in those countries in which such relationships are mandatory or customary. The provisions of these agreements generally correspond in each case with the required or customary terms in the subject jurisdiction.  Sales and Revenues  Sales and revenues outside the United States were 59 percent of consolidated sales and revenues for 2017 , 2016 and 2015 . Additional information related to total sales and revenues and long-lived assets aggregated by our U.S. and non-U.S. operations appears in Note 23  Segment information of Part II, Item 8 Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. Environmental Matters  The company is regulated by federal, state and international environmental laws governing our use, transport and disposal of substances and control of emissions. In addition to governing our manufacturing and other operations, these laws often impact the development of our products, including, but not limited to, required compliance with air emissions standards applicable to internal combustion engines. We have made, and will continue to make, significant research and development and capital expenditures to comply with these emissions standards.  We are engaged in remedial activities at a number of locations, often with other companies, pursuant to federal and state laws. When it is probable we will pay remedial costs at a site, and those costs can be reasonably estimated, the investigation, remediation, and operating and maintenance costs of the remedial action are accrued against our earnings. Costs are accrued based on consideration of currently available data and information with respect to each individual site, including available technologies, current applicable laws and regulations, and prior remediation experience. Where no amount within a range of estimates is more likely, we accrue the minimum. Where multiple potentially responsible parties are involved, we consider our proportionate share of the probable costs. In formulating the estimate of probable costs, we do not consider amounts expected to be recovered from insurance companies or others. We reassess these accrued amounts on a quarterly basis. The amount recorded for environmental remediation is not material and is included in the line item \"Accrued expenses\" in Statement 3  \"Consolidated Financial Position at December 31\" of Part II, Item 8 \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\" There is no more than a remote chance that a material amount for remedial activities at any individual site, or at all the sites in the aggregate, will be required.

Risk Factors. ##TABLE_END  The statements in this section describe the most significant risks to our business and should be considered carefully in conjunction with Part II, Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements of Part II, Item 8 \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\" to this Form 10-K. In addition, the statements in this section and other sections of this Form 10-K, including in Part II, Item 7 \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\" include forward-looking statements as that term is defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and involve uncertainties that could significantly impact results. Forward-looking statements give current expectations or forecasts of future events about the company or our outlook. You can identify forward-looking statements by the fact they do not relate to historical or current facts and by the use of words such as believe, expect, estimate, anticipate, will be, should, plan, project, intend, could and similar words or expressions.  Forward-looking statements are based on assumptions and on known risks and uncertainties. Although we believe we have been prudent in our assumptions, any or all of our forward-looking statements may prove to be inaccurate, and we can make no guarantees about our future performance. Should known or unknown risks or uncertainties materialize or underlying assumptions prove inaccurate, actual results could materially differ from past results and/or those anticipated, estimated or projected. We undertake no obligation to publicly update forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. You should, however, consult any subsequent disclosures we make in our filings with the SEC on Form 10-Q or Form 8-K.  The following is a cautionary discussion of risks, uncertainties and assumptions that we believe are significant to our business. In addition to the factors discussed elsewhere in this report, the following are some of the important factors that, individually or in the aggregate, we believe could make our actual results differ materially from those described in any forward-looking statements. It is impossible to predict or identify all such factors and, as a result, you should not consider the following factors to be a complete discussion of risks, uncertainties and assumptions. MACROECONOMIC RISKS Our business and the industries we serve are highly sensitive to global and regional economic conditions.  Our results of operations are materially affected by economic conditions globally and regionally and in the particular industries we serve. The demand for our products and services tends to be cyclical and can be significantly reduced in periods of economic weakness characterized by lower levels of government and business investment, lower levels of business confidence, lower corporate earnings, high real interest rates, lower credit activity or tighter credit conditions, perceived or actual industry overcapacity, higher unemployment and lower consumer spending. A prolonged period of economic weakness may also result in increased expenses due to higher allowances for doubtful accounts and potential goodwill and asset impairment charges. Economic conditions vary across regions and countries, and demand for our products and services generally increases in those regions and countries experiencing economic growth and investment. Slower economic growth or a change in the global mix of regions and countries experiencing economic growth and investment could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.  The energy, transportation and mining industries are major users of our products, including the coal, iron ore, gold, copper, oil and natural gas industries. Customers in these industries frequently base their decisions to purchase our products on the expected future performance of these industries, which in turn are dependent in part on commodity prices. Prices of commodities in these industries are frequently volatile and can change abruptly and unpredictably in response to general economic conditions and trends, government actions, regulatory actions, commodity inventories, production and consumption levels, technological innovations, commodity substitutions, market expectations and any disruptions in production or distribution. Economic conditions affecting the industries we serve may in the future also lead to reduced capital expenditures by our customers. Reduced capital expenditures by our customers are likely to lead to a decrease in the demand for our products and may also result in a decrease in demand for aftermarket parts as customers are likely to extend preventative maintenance schedules and delay major overhauls when possible.  The rates of infrastructure spending, housing starts and commercial construction also play a significant role in our results. Our products are an integral component of these activities, and as these activities decrease, demand for our products may be significantly impacted, which could negatively impact our results. Commodity price changes, material price increases, fluctuations in demand for our products, significant disruptions to our supply chains or significant shortages of material may adversely impact our financial results or our ability to meet commitments to customers.  We are a significant user of steel and many other commodities required for the manufacture of our products. Increases in the prices of such commodities would increase our costs, negatively impacting our business, results of operations and financial condition if we are unable to fully offset the effect of these increased costs through price increases, productivity improvements or cost reduction programs.  We rely on suppliers to produce or secure material required for the manufacture of our products. A disruption in deliveries to or from suppliers or decreased availability of raw materials or commodities could have an adverse effect on our ability to meet our commitments to customers or increase our operating costs. The increase in demand in 2017 has led to challenges for certain products due to supplier constraints. Despite improvements in material flows in the second half of 2017, parts and components constraints remain across some products, which could impact our growth potential in 2018 as our global suppliers continue to increase production to meet demand. On the other hand, in circumstances where demand for our products is less than we expect, we may experience excess inventories and be forced to incur additional costs and our profitability may suffer. Our business, competitive position, results of operations or financial condition could be negatively impacted if supply is insufficient for our operations, if we experience excess inventories or if we are unable to adjust our production schedules or our purchases from suppliers to reflect changes in customer demand and market fluctuations on a timely basis. Changes in government monetary or fiscal policies may negatively impact our results .  Most countries where our products and services are sold have established central banks to regulate monetary systems and influence economic activities, generally by adjusting interest rates. Interest rate changes affect overall economic growth, which affects demand for residential and nonresidential structures, as well as energy and mined products, which in turn affects sales of our products and services that serve these activities. Interest rate changes may also affect our customers ability to finance machine purchases, can change the optimal time to keep machines in a fleet and can impact the ability of our suppliers to finance the production of parts and components necessary to manufacture and support our products. Increases in interest rates could negatively impact sales and create supply chain inefficiencies.  Central banks and other policy arms of many countries may take actions to vary the amount of liquidity and credit available in an economy. The impact from a change in liquidity and credit policies could negatively affect the customers and markets we serve or our suppliers, which could adversely impact our business, results of operations and financial condition. Changes in monetary and fiscal policies, along with other factors, may cause currency exchange rates to fluctuate. Actions that lead the currency exchange rate of a country where we manufacture products to increase relative to other currencies could reduce the competitiveness of products made in that country, which could adversely affect our competitive position, results of operations and financial condition. Government policies on taxes and spending also affect our business. Throughout the world, government spending finances a significant portion of infrastructure development, such as highways, airports, sewer and water systems and dams. Tax regulations determine asset depreciation lives and impact the after-tax returns on business activity and investment, both of which influence investment decisions. Unfavorable developments, such as declines in government revenues, decisions to reduce public spending or increases in taxes, could negatively impact our results. Our global operations are exposed to political and economic risks, commercial instability and events beyond our control in the countries in which we operate.  Our global operations are dependent upon products manufactured, purchased and sold in the U.S. and internationally, including in countries with political and economic instability or uncertainty. This includes, for example, the uncertainty related to the United Kingdoms withdrawal from the European Union (commonly known as Brexit).  Some countries have greater political and economic volatility and greater vulnerability to infrastructure and labor disruptions than others. Our business could be negatively impacted by adverse fluctuations in freight costs, limitations on shipping and receiving capacity, and other disruptions in the transportation and shipping infrastructure at important geographic points of exit and entry for our products. Operating in different regions and countries exposes us to a number of risks, including: ##TABLE_START  multiple and potentially conflicting laws, regulations and policies that are subject to change; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  imposition of currency restrictions, restrictions on repatriation of earnings or other restraints; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  imposition of burdensome tariffs or quotas; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  changes in trade agreements; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  imposition of new or additional trade and economic sanctions laws imposed by the U.S. or foreign governments; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  war or terrorist acts; and ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  political and economic instability or civil unrest that may severely disrupt economic activity in affected countries. ##TABLE_END The occurrence of one or more of these events may negatively impact our business, results of operations and financial condition.  OPERATIONAL RISKS The success of our business depends on our ability to develop, produce and market quality products that meet our customers needs.  Our business relies on continued global demand for our brands and products. To achieve business goals, we must develop and sell products that appeal to our dealers, OEMs and end-user customers. This is dependent on a number of factors, including our ability to maintain key dealer relationships, our ability to produce products that meet the quality, performance and price expectations of our customers and our ability to develop effective sales, advertising and marketing programs. In addition, our continued success in selling products that appeal to our customers is dependent on leading-edge innovation, with respect to both products and operations, and on the availability and effectiveness of legal protection for our innovations. Failure to continue to deliver high quality, innovative, competitive products to the marketplace, to adequately protect our intellectual property rights, to supply products that meet applicable regulatory requirements, including engine exhaust emission requirements or to predict market demands for, or gain market acceptance of, our products, could have a negative impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition. We operate in a highly competitive environment, which could adversely affect our sales and pricing.  We operate in a highly competitive environment. We compete on the basis of a variety of factors, including product performance, customer service, quality and price. There can be no assurance that our products will be able to compete successfully with other companies products. Thus, our share of industry sales could be reduced due to aggressive pricing or product strategies pursued by competitors, unanticipated product or manufacturing difficulties, our failure to price our products competitively, our failure to produce our products at a competitive cost or an unexpected buildup in competitors new machine or dealer-owned rental fleets, leading to downward pressure on machine rental rates and/or used equipment prices.  Lack of customer acceptance of price increases we announce from time to time, changes in customer requirements for price discounts, changes in our customers behavior or a weak pricing environment could have an adverse impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition.  In addition, our results and ability to compete may be impacted negatively by changes in our geographic and product mix of sales. Increased information technology security threats and more sophisticated computer crime pose a risk to our systems, networks, products and services. We rely upon information technology systems and networks, some of which are managed by third parties, in connection with a variety of business activities. Additionally, we collect and store data that is sensitive to Caterpillar. Operating these information technology systems and networks and processing and maintaining this data, in a secure manner, are critical to our business operations and strategy. Information technology security threats -- from user error to cybersecurity attacks designed to gain unauthorized access to our systems, networks and data -- are increasing in frequency and sophistication. Cybersecurity attacks may range from random attempts to coordinated and targeted attacks, including sophisticated computer crime and advanced persistent threats. These threats pose a risk to the security of our systems and networks and the confidentiality, availability and integrity of our data. Cybersecurity attacks could also include attacks targeting customer data or the security, integrity and/or reliability of the hardware and software installed in our products. We have experienced cybersecurity attacks that have resulted in unauthorized parties gaining access to our information technology systems and networks, and we could in the future experience similar attacks. However, to date, no cybersecurity attack has had a material impact on our financial condition, results of operations or liquidity. While we actively manage information technology security risks within our control, there can be no assurance that such actions will be sufficient to mitigate all potential risks to our systems, networks and data. The potential consequences of a material cybersecurity attack include reputational damage, litigation with third parties, disruption to systems, unauthorized release of confidential or otherwise protected information, corruption of data, diminution in the value of our investment in research, development and engineering, and increased cybersecurity protection and remediation costs, which in turn could adversely affect our competitiveness, results of operations and financial condition. The amount of insurance coverage we maintain may be inadequate to cover claims or liabilities relating to a cybersecurity attack. We expect to incur additional restructuring charges as we continue to contemplate cost reduction actions in an effort to optimize our cost structure and may not achieve the anticipated savings and benefits of these actions. In response to economic and business conditions, we have taken significant restructuring and cost reduction actions in recent years. We expect to take additional restructuring actions as we continue to optimize our cost structure and improve the efficiency of our operation, which may reduce our profitability in the periods incurred. As a result of these actions, we will incur charges, which may include but not be limited to asset impairments, employee termination costs, charges for pension and other postretirement contractual benefits, potential additional pension funding obligations, and pension curtailments, any of which could be significant, and could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. In addition, we may not realize anticipated savings or benefits from past or future cost reduction actions in full or in part or within the time periods we expect. We are also subject to the risks of labor unrest, negative publicity and business disruption in connection with our cost reduction actions. Failure to realize anticipated savings or benefits from our cost reduction actions could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition, liquidity, results of operations and cash flows. We may not realize all of the anticipated benefits from cash flow improvement initiatives and efficiency or productivity initiatives. We are actively engaged in a number of initiatives to increase our productivity, efficiency and cash flow, which we expect to have a positive long-term effect on our business, competitive position, results of operations and financial condition. For example, one such initiative is to implement sustained improvements in our operational efficiency and order-to-delivery processes so that our lead time is better aligned with customer requirements, as well as to reduce waste, further enhance quality and maximize value for our customers. There can be no assurance that these initiatives or others will continue to be beneficial to the extent anticipated, or that the estimated efficiency improvements or cash flow improvements will be realized as anticipated or at all. If these initiatives are not implemented successfully, it could have an adverse effect on our operations and competitive position. Our business is subject to the inventory management decisions and sourcing practices of our dealers and our OEM customers.  We sell finished products primarily through an independent dealer network and directly to OEMs and are subject to risks relating to their inventory management decisions and operational and sourcing practices. Both carry inventories of finished products as part of ongoing operations and adjust those inventories based on their assessments of future needs and market conditions, including levels of used equipment inventory. Such adjustments may impact our results positively or negatively. If the inventory levels of our dealers and OEM customers are higher than they desire, they may postpone product purchases from us, which could cause our sales to be lower than the end-user demand for our products and negatively impact our results. Similarly, our results could be negatively impacted through the loss of time-sensitive sales if our dealers and OEM customers do not maintain inventory levels sufficient to meet customer demand. We may not realize all of the anticipated benefits of our acquisitions, joint ventures or divestitures, or these benefits may take longer to realize than expected. In pursuing our business strategy, we routinely evaluate targets and enter into agreements regarding possible acquisitions, divestitures and joint ventures. We often compete with others for the same opportunities. To be successful, we conduct due diligence to identify valuation issues and potential loss contingencies, negotiate transaction terms, complete complex transactions and manage post-closing matters such as the integration of acquired businesses. Further, while we seek to mitigate risks and liabilities of such transactions through, among other things, due diligence, there may be risks and liabilities that such due diligence efforts fail to discover, that are not accurately or completely disclosed to us or that we inadequately assess. We may incur unanticipated costs or expenses following a completed acquisition, including post-closing asset impairment charges, expenses associated with eliminating duplicate facilities, litigation, and other liabilities. Risks associated with our past or future acquisitions also include the following: ##TABLE_START  the business culture of the acquired business may not match well with our culture; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  technological and product synergies, economies of scale and cost reductions may not occur as expected; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  unforeseen expenses, delays or conditions may be imposed upon the acquisition, including due to required regulatory approvals or consents; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  we may acquire or assume unexpected liabilities or be subject to unexpected penalties or other enforcement actions; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  faulty assumptions may be made regarding the macroeconomic environment or the integration process; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  unforeseen difficulties may arise in integrating operations, processes and systems; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  higher than expected investments may be required to implement necessary compliance processes and related systems, including IT systems, accounting systems and internal controls over financial reporting; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  we may fail to retain, motivate and integrate key management and other employees of the acquired business; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  higher than expected costs may arise due to unforeseen changes in tax, trade, environmental, labor, safety, payroll or pension policies in any jurisdiction in which the acquired business conducts its operations; and ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  we may experience problems in retaining customers and integrating customer bases. ##TABLE_END Many of these factors will be outside of our control and any one of them could result in increased costs, decreases in the amount of expected revenues and diversion of managements time and attention. They may also delay the realization of the benefits we anticipate when we enter into a transaction.  In order to conserve cash for operations, we may undertake acquisitions financed in part through public offerings or private placements of debt or equity securities, or other arrangements. Such acquisition financing could result in a decrease in our earnings and adversely affect other leverage measures. If we issue equity securities or equity-linked securities, the issued securities may have a dilutive effect on the interests of the holders of our common shares.  Failure to implement our acquisition strategy, including successfully integrating acquired businesses, could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Furthermore, we make strategic divestitures from time to time. In the case of divestitures, we may agree to indemnify acquiring parties for certain liabilities arising from our former businesses. These divestitures may also result in continued financial involvement in the divested businesses, including through guarantees or other financial arrangements, following the transaction. Lower performance by those divested businesses could affect our future financial results. Union disputes or other labor matters could adversely affect our operations and financial results.  Some of our employees are represented by labor unions in a number of countries under various collective bargaining agreements with varying durations and expiration dates. There can be no assurance that any current or future issues with our employees will be resolved or that we will not encounter future strikes, work stoppages or other types of conflicts with labor unions or our employees. We may not be able to satisfactorily renegotiate collective bargaining agreements in the United States and other countries when they expire. If we fail to renegotiate our existing collective bargaining agreements, we could encounter strikes or work stoppages or other types of conflicts with labor unions. In addition, existing collective bargaining agreements may not prevent a strike or work stoppage at our facilities in the future. We may also be subject to general country strikes or work stoppages unrelated to our business or collective bargaining agreements. A work stoppage or other limitations on production at our facilities for any reason could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. In addition, many of our customers and suppliers have unionized work forces. Strikes or work stoppages experienced by our customers or suppliers could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Unexpected events, including natural disasters, may increase our cost of doing business or disrupt our operations.  The occurrence of one or more unexpected events, including war, terrorist acts or violence, fires, tornadoes, tsunamis, hurricanes, earthquakes, floods and other forms of severe weather in the United States or in other countries in which we operate or in which our suppliers are located could adversely affect our operations and financial performance. Natural disasters, pandemic illness, equipment failures, power outages or other unexpected events could result in physical damage to and complete or partial closure of one or more of our manufacturing facilities or distribution centers, temporary or long-term disruption in the supply of component products from some local and international suppliers, disruption in the transport of our products to dealers and end-users and delay in the delivery of our products to our distribution centers. Existing insurance coverage may not provide protection for all of the costs that may arise from such events. FINANCIAL RISKS Disruptions or volatility in global financial markets could limit our sources of liquidity, or the liquidity of our customers, dealers and suppliers.  Continuing to meet our cash requirements over the long-term requires substantial liquidity and access to varied sources of funds, including capital and credit markets. Global economic conditions may cause volatility and disruptions in the capital and credit markets. Market volatility, changes in counterparty credit risk, the impact of government intervention in financial markets and general economic conditions may also adversely impact our ability to access capital and credit markets to fund operating needs. Global or regional economic downturns could cause financial markets to decrease the availability of liquidity, credit and credit capacity for certain issuers, including certain customers, dealers and suppliers. An inability to access capital and credit markets may have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and competitive position. Furthermore, changes in global economic conditions, including material cost increases and decreases in economic activity in key markets we serve, and the success of plans to manage cost increases, inventory and other important elements of our business may significantly impact our ability to generate funds from operations.  In addition, demand for our products generally depends on customers ability to pay for our products, which, in turn, depends on their access to funds. Changes in global economic conditions may result in customers experiencing increased difficulty in generating funds from operations. Capital and credit market volatility and uncertainty may cause financial institutions to revise their lending standards, resulting in customers decreased access to capital. If capital and credit market volatility occurs, customers liquidity may decline which, in turn, would reduce their ability to purchase our products. Failure to maintain our credit ratings would increase our cost of borrowing and could adversely affect our cost of funds, liquidity, competitive position and access to capital markets.  Each of Caterpillars and Cat Financials costs of borrowing and their respective ability to access the capital markets are affected not only by market conditions but also by the short- and long-term credit ratings assigned to their respective debt by the major credit rating agencies. These ratings are based, in significant part, on each of Caterpillars and Cat Financials performance as measured by financial metrics such as net worth, interest coverage and leverage ratios, as well as transparency with rating agencies and timeliness of financial reporting. There can be no assurance that Caterpillar or Cat Financial will be able to maintain their credit ratings. On December 13, 2016, Moodys Investors Service (Moodys) downgraded the long- and short-term ratings of Caterpillar and Cat Financial to A3 from A2 and to Prime-2 from Prime-1. A further downgrade of Caterpillar or Cat Financials credit ratings by Moodys or one of the other major credit rating agencies would result in increased borrowing costs and could adversely affect Caterpillars and Cat Financials liquidity, competitive position and access to the capital markets, including restricting, in whole or in part, access to the commercial paper market. There can be no assurance that the commercial paper market will continue to be a reliable source of short-term financing for Cat Financial or an available source of short-term financing for Caterpillar. An inability to access the capital markets could have an adverse effect on our cash flow, results of operations and financial condition.  Our Financial Products segment is subject to risks associated with the financial services industry.  Cat Financial is significant to our operations and provides financing support to a significant share of our global sales. The inability of Cat Financial to access funds to support its financing activities to our customers could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Continuing to meet Cat Financial's cash requirements over the long-term could require substantial liquidity and access to sources of funds, including capital and credit markets. Cat Financial has continued to maintain access to key global medium term note and commercial paper markets, but there can be no assurance that such markets will continue to represent a reliable source of financing. If global economic conditions were to deteriorate, Cat Financial could face materially higher financing costs, become unable to access adequate funding to operate and grow its business and/or meet its debt service obligations as they mature, and be required to draw upon contractually committed lending agreements and/or seek other funding sources. However, there can be no assurance that such agreements and other funding sources would be available or sufficient under extreme market conditions. Any of these events could negatively impact Cat Financials business, as well as our and Cat Financial's results of operations and financial condition.  Market disruption and volatility may also lead to a number of other risks in connection with these events, including but not limited to: ##TABLE_START  Market developments that may affect customer confidence levels and cause declines in the demand for financing and adverse changes in payment patterns, causing increases in delinquencies and default rates, which could impact Cat Financials write-offs and provision for credit losses. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  The process Cat Financial uses to estimate losses inherent in its credit exposure requires a high degree of managements judgment regarding numerous subjective qualitative factors, including forecasts of economic conditions and how economic predictors might impair the ability of its borrowers to repay their loans. Financial market disruption and volatility may impact the accuracy of these judgments. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  Cat Financials ability to engage in routine funding transactions or borrow from other financial institutions on acceptable terms or at all could be adversely affected by disruptions in the capital markets or other events, including actions by rating agencies and deteriorating investor expectations. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  As Cat Financials lending agreements are primarily with financial institutions, their ability to perform in accordance with any of its underlying agreements could be adversely affected by market volatility and/or disruptions in financial markets. ##TABLE_END Changes in interest rates or market liquidity conditions could adversely affect Cat Financial's and our earnings and/or cash flow.  Changes in interest rates and market liquidity conditions could have an adverse effect on Cat Financial's and our earnings and cash flows. Because a significant number of the loans made by Cat Financial are made at fixed interest rates, its business is subject to fluctuations in interest rates. Changes in market interest rates may influence its financing costs, returns on financial investments and the valuation of derivative contracts and could reduce its and our earnings and cash flows. Although Cat Financial manages interest rate and market liquidity risks through a variety of techniques, including a match funding program, the selective use of derivatives and a broadly diversified funding program, there can be no assurance that fluctuations in interest rates and market liquidity conditions will not have an adverse effect on its and our earnings and cash flows. If any of the variety of instruments and strategies Cat Financial uses to hedge its exposure to these types of risk is ineffective, we may incur losses. With respect to Insurance Services' investment activities, changes in the equity and bond markets could cause an impairment of the value of its investment portfolio, requiring a negative adjustment to earnings. An increase in delinquencies, repossessions or net losses of Cat Financial customers could adversely affect its results.  Inherent in the operation of Cat Financial is the credit risk associated with its customers. The creditworthiness of each customer and the rate of delinquencies, repossessions and net losses on customer obligations are directly impacted by several factors, including relevant industry and economic conditions, the availability of capital, the experience and expertise of the customer's management team, commodity prices, political events and the sustained value of the underlying collateral. Any increase in delinquencies, repossessions and net losses on customer obligations could have a material adverse effect on Cat Financial's and our earnings and cash flows. In addition, although Cat Financial evaluates and adjusts its allowance for credit losses related to past due and non-performing receivables on a regular basis, adverse economic conditions or other factors that might cause deterioration of the financial health of its customers could change the timing and level of payments received and necessitate an increase in Cat Financial's estimated losses, which could also have a material adverse effect on Cat Financial's and our earnings and cash flows. Currency exchange rate fluctuations affect our results of operations.  We conduct operations in many countries involving transactions denominated in a variety of currencies. We are subject to currency exchange rate risk to the extent that our costs are denominated in currencies other than those in which we earn revenues. Fluctuations in currency exchange rates have had, and will continue to have, an impact on our results as expressed in U.S. dollars. There can be no assurance that currency exchange rate fluctuations will not adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. While the use of currency hedging instruments may provide us with protection from adverse fluctuations in currency exchange rates, by utilizing these instruments we potentially forego the benefits that might result from favorable fluctuations in currency exchange rates. In addition, our outlooks do not assume fluctuations in currency exchange rates. Adverse fluctuations in currency exchange rates from the date of our outlooks could cause our actual results to differ materially from those anticipated in our outlooks and adversely impact our business, results of operations and financial condition.  We also face risks arising from the imposition of exchange controls and currency devaluations. Exchange controls may limit our ability to convert foreign currencies into U.S. dollars or to remit dividends and other payments by our foreign subsidiaries or businesses located in or conducted within a country imposing controls. Currency devaluations result in a diminished value of funds denominated in the currency of the country instituting the devaluation.  Restrictive covenants in our debt agreements could limit our financial and operating flexibility.  We maintain a number of credit facilities to support general corporate purposes (facilities) and have issued debt securities to manage liquidity and fund operations (debt securities). The agreements relating to a number of the facilities and the debt securities contain certain restrictive covenants applicable to us and certain subsidiaries, including Cat Financial. These covenants include maintaining a minimum consolidated net worth (defined as the consolidated shareholders equity including preferred stock but excluding the pension and other post-retirement benefits balance within accumulated other comprehensive income (loss)), limitations on the incurrence of liens and certain restrictions on consolidation and merger. Cat Financial has also agreed under certain of these agreements not to exceed a certain leverage ratio (consolidated debt to consolidated net worth, calculated (1) on a monthly basis as the average of the leverage ratios determined on the last day of each of the six preceding calendar months and (2) at each December 31), to maintain a minimum interest coverage ratio (profit excluding income taxes, interest expense and net gain/(loss) from interest rate derivatives to interest expense, calculated at the end of each calendar quarter for the rolling four quarter period then most recently ended) and not to terminate, amend or modify its support agreement with us.  A breach of one or more of the covenants could result in adverse consequences that could negatively impact our business, results of operations and financial condition. These consequences may include the acceleration of amounts outstanding under certain of the facilities, triggering of an obligation to redeem certain debt securities, termination of existing unused commitments by our lenders, refusal by our lenders to extend further credit under one or more of the facilities or to enter into new facilities or the lowering or modification of our credit ratings or those of one or more of our subsidiaries.  Sustained increases in funding obligations under our pension plans may impair our liquidity or financial condition.  We maintain certain defined benefit pension plans for our employees, which impose on us certain funding obligations. In determining our future payment obligations under the plans, we assume certain rates of return on the plan assets and a certain level of future benefit payments. Significant adverse changes in credit or capital markets could result in actual rates of return being materially lower than projected and increased contribution requirements. We are expecting to make contributions to our pension plans in the future, and may be required to make contributions that could be material. We may fund contributions through the use of cash on hand, the proceeds of borrowings, shares of our common stock or a combination of the foregoing, as permitted by applicable law. Our assumptions for future benefit payments may also be materially higher than projected. These factors could significantly increase our payment obligations under the plans, and as a result, adversely affect our business and overall financial condition. LEGAL  REGULATORY RISKS Our global operations are subject to extensive trade and anti-corruption laws and regulations.  Due to the international scope of our operations, we are subject to a complex system of import- and export-related laws and regulations, including U.S. regulations issued by Customs and Border Protection, the Bureau of Industry and Security, the Office of Antiboycott Compliance, the Directorate of Defense Trade Controls and the Office of Foreign Assets Control, as well as the counterparts of these agencies in other countries. Any alleged or actual violations may subject us to government scrutiny, investigation and civil and criminal penalties, and may limit our ability to import or export our products or to provide services outside the United States. Furthermore, embargoes and sanctions imposed by the U.S. and other governments restricting or prohibiting sales to specific persons or countries or based on product classification may expose us to potential criminal and civil sanctions. We cannot predict the nature, scope or effect of future regulatory requirements to which our operations might be subject or the manner in which existing laws might be administered or interpreted.  In addition, the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and similar foreign anti-corruption laws generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments or providing anything of value to improperly influence foreign government officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business, or obtaining an unfair advantage. Recent years have seen a substantial increase in the global enforcement of anti-corruption laws. Our operations outside the United States, including in developing countries, could increase the risk of such violations. Violations of anti-corruption laws or regulations by our employees, by intermediaries acting on our behalf, or by our joint venture partners may result in severe criminal or civil sanctions, could disrupt our business, and result in an adverse effect on our reputation, business and results of operations or financial condition. International trade policies may impact demand for our products and our competitive position.  Government policies on international trade and investment such as import quotas, capital controls or tariffs, whether adopted by individual governments or addressed by regional trade blocs, can affect the demand for our products and services, impact the competitive position of our products or prevent us from being able to sell products in certain countries. The implementation of more restrictive trade policies, such as more detailed inspections, higher tariffs or new barriers to entry, in countries where we sell large quantities of products and services could negatively impact our business, results of operations and financial condition. For example, a governments adoption of buy national policies or retaliation by another government against such policies could have a negative impact on our results of operations. We may incur additional tax expense or become subject to additional tax exposure.  We are subject to income taxes in the United States and numerous other jurisdictions. Our future results of operations could be adversely affected by changes in the effective tax rate as a result of a change in the mix of earnings in jurisdictions with differing statutory tax rates, changes in our overall profitability, changes in tax laws or treaties or in their application or interpretation, changes in tax rates, changes in generally accepted accounting principles, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, changes in the amount of earnings indefinitely reinvested in certain non-U.S. jurisdictions, the results of audits and examinations of previously filed tax returns and continuing assessments of our tax exposures. We are also subject to the continuous examination of our income tax returns by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities. We regularly assess the likelihood of an adverse outcome resulting from these examinations. If our effective tax rates were to increase, or if the ultimate determination of our taxes owed is for an amount in excess of amounts previously accrued, our operating results, cash flows and financial condition could be adversely affected. For information regarding additional legal matters related to our taxes, please see Note 5  \"Income taxes\" and Note 22  \"Environmental and legal matters\" of Part II, Item 8 \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\" to this Annual Report on Form 10-K . Costs associated with lawsuits or investigations or adverse rulings in enforcement or other legal proceedings may have an adverse effect on our results of operations.  We are subject to a variety of legal proceedings and legal compliance risks in virtually every part of the world. We face risk of exposure to various types of claims, lawsuits and government investigations. We are involved in various claims and lawsuits related to product design, manufacture and performance liability (including claimed asbestos and welding fumes exposure), contracts, employment issues, environmental matters, intellectual property rights, tax, securities and other legal proceedings that arise in and outside of the ordinary course of our business. The industries in which we operate are also periodically reviewed or investigated by regulators, which could lead to enforcement actions, fines and penalties or the assertion of private litigation claims. It is not possible to predict with certainty the outcome of claims, investigations and lawsuits, and we could in the future incur judgments, fines or penalties or enter into settlements of lawsuits and claims that could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition in any particular period. The global and diverse nature of our operations means that legal and compliance risks will continue to exist and additional legal proceedings and other contingencies, the outcome of which cannot be predicted with certainty, may arise from time to time. In addition, subsequent developments in legal proceedings may affect our assessment and estimates of loss contingencies recorded as a reserve and require us to make payments in excess of our reserves, which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. New regulations or changes in financial services regulation could adversely impact Caterpillar and Cat Financial.  Cat Financials operations are highly regulated by governmental authorities in the locations where it operates, which can impose significant additional costs and/or restrictions on its business. In the U.S., for example, certain Cat Financial activities are subject to the U.S. Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Dodd-Frank), which includes extensive provisions regulating the financial services industry. As such, Cat Financial has become and could continue to become subject to additional regulatory costs that could be significant  and have an adverse effect on Cat Financial's and our results of operations and financial condition. Additional regulations in the U.S. or internationally impacting the financial services industry could also add significant cost or operational constraints that might have an adverse effect on Cat Financial's and our results of operations and financial condition. We are subject to stringent environmental laws and regulations that impose significant compliance costs.  Our facilities, operations and products are subject to increasingly stringent environmental laws and regulations globally, including laws and regulations governing emissions to noise, air, releases to soil and discharges to water and the generation, handling, storage, transportation, treatment and disposal of non-hazardous and hazardous waste materials. Some environmental laws impose strict, retroactive and joint and several liability for the remediation of the release of hazardous substances, even for conduct that was lawful at the time it occurred, or for the conduct of, or conditions caused by, prior operators, predecessors or other third parties. Failure to comply with environmental laws could expose us to penalties or clean-up costs, civil or criminal liability and sanctions on certain of our activities, as well as damage to property or natural resources. The potential liabilities, sanctions, damages and remediation efforts related to any non-compliance with such laws and regulations could negatively impact our ability to conduct our operations and our financial condition and results of operations. In addition, there can be no assurances that we will not be adversely affected by costs, liabilities or claims with respect to existing or subsequently acquired operations or under present laws and regulations or those that may be adopted or imposed in the future. Environmental laws and regulations may change from time to time, as may related interpretations and other guidance. Changes in environmental laws or regulations could result in higher expenses and payments, and uncertainty relating to environmental laws or regulations may also affect how we conduct our operations and structure our investments and could limit our ability to enforce our rights. Changes in environmental and climate change laws or regulations, including laws relating to greenhouse gas emissions, could lead to new or additional investment in product designs and could increase environmental compliance expenditures. Changes in climate change concerns, or in the regulation of such concerns, including greenhouse gas emissions, could subject us to additional costs and restrictions, including increased energy and raw materials costs. If environmental laws or regulations are either changed or adopted and impose significant operational restrictions and compliance requirements upon us or our products, they could negatively impact our business, capital expenditures, results of operations, financial condition and competitive position. ##TABLE_START ", "1B": " Item 1B.

Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. ##TABLE_END  This Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations should be read in conjunction with our discussion of cautionary statements and significant risks to the companys business under Item 1A. Risk Factors of the 2017 Form 10-K. OVERVIEW Our sales and revenues for 2017 were $45.462 billion, an 18 percent increase from 2016 sales and revenues of $38.537 billion. The increase was primarily due to higher sales volume , mostly due to improved end-user demand. In addition, favorable changes in dealer inventories contributed to increased sales volume. The improvement in end-user demand was across all regions and most end markets. The favorable change in dealer inventories was primarily due to a decrease in 2016, compared to dealer inventories that were about flat in 2017. Favorable price realization , mostly in Construction Industries , also contributed to the sales improvement. Profit per share for 2017 was $1.26, compared to a loss per share of $0.11 in 2016. Profit was $754 million in 2017, compared to a loss of $67 million in 2016. The increase was primarily due to higher sales volume, improved price realization, a decrease in mark-to-market losses related to pension and other postemployment benefits (OPEB) plans and the absence of a goodwill impairment charge in Resource Industries in 2016 offset by higher taxes primarily due to enactment of U.S. tax reform legislation on December 22, 2017. An increase in period costs and restructuring costs was partially offset by lower variable manufacturing costs . Fourth-quarter 2017 sales and revenues were $12.896 billion, up $3.322 billion, or 35 percent, from $9.574 billion in the fourth quarter of 2016. Fourth-quarter 2017 loss was $2.18 per share, compared with a loss of $2.00 per share in the fourth quarter of 2016. Fourth-quarter 2017 loss was $1.299 billion, compared with a loss of $1.171 billion in 2016. Highlights for 2017 include: ##TABLE_START  Sales and revenues in 2017 were $45.462 billion, up 18 percent from 2016. Sales improved in all regions and most end markets. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Profit was $1.26 per share for 2017, and excluding the items in the table below, adjusted profit per share was $6.88. For 2016, loss per share was $0.11, and excluding the items in the table below, adjusted profit per share was $3.42. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  In order for our results to be more meaningful to our readers, we have separately quantified the impact of several significant items: ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  Inventory decreased about $200 million in the fourth-quarter 2017. For the full year, inventory increased about $1.4 billion. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Machinery, Energy  Transportation (MET) operating cash flow for 2017 was about $5.5 billion, more than sufficient to cover capital expenditures and dividends. ##TABLE_END Restructuring Costs In recent years, we have incurred substantial restructuring costs to achieve a flexible and competitive cost structure. During 2017, we incurred $1.256 billion of restructuring costs with about half related to the closure of the facility in Gosselies, Belgium, and the remainder related to other restructuring actions across the company. During 2016, we incurred $1.019 billion of restructuring costs, primarily related to Resource Industries and Energy  Transportation . In 2018, we expect restructuring actions to continue and anticipate costs of about $400 million.

Items favorably impacting sales and revenues appear as upward stair steps with the corresponding dollar amounts above each bar, while items negatively impacting sales and revenues appear as downward stair steps with dollar amounts reflected in parentheses above each bar. Caterpillar management utilizes these charts internally to visually communicate with the company's Board of Directors and employees. Total sales and revenues were $45.462 billion in 2017, an increase of $6.925 billion, or 18 percent, compared with $38.537 billion in 2016. The increase was primarily due to higher sales volume, mostly due to improved end-user demand, which we expect to continue in 2018. In addition, favorable changes in dealer inventories contributed to increased sales volume. The improvement in end-user demand was across all regions and most end markets. The favorable change in dealer inventories was primarily due to a decrease in 2016, compared to dealer inventories that were about flat in 2017. Dealer machine and engine inventories increased about $100 million in 2017, compared to a decrease of about $1.6 billion during 2016. Dealers are independent, and there could be many reasons for changes in their inventory levels, including their expectations of future demand and product delivery times. Dealers demand expectations take into account seasonal changes, macroeconomic conditions, machine rental rates and other factors. Delivery times can vary based on availability of product from Caterpillar factories and product distribution centers. By segment, the largest sales volume increase was in Construction Industries mostly due to higher end-user demand for construction equipment. Resource Industries sales volume increased due to higher end-user demand for aftermarket parts and equipment and a favorable impact of changes in dealer inventories. Energy  Transportations sales volume was higher mostly due to increased demand for equipment and aftermarket parts for oil and gas and industrial applications. Favorable price realization, mostly in Construction Industries, also contributed to the sales improvement. Financial Products revenues were about flat. Sales increased in all regions. In North America, sales increased 19 percent primarily due to higher end-user demand mostly for on-shore oil and gas applications and construction equipment, the favorable impact of changes in dealer inventories and favorable price realization, primarily in Construction Industries. Asia/Pacific sales increased 23 percent primarily due to an increase in construction equipment sales, mostly in China resulting from increased building construction and infrastructure investment. EAME sales increased 16 percent primarily due to higher end-user demand for equipment and aftermarket parts in Resource Industries and favorable changes in dealer inventories, as dealers decreased inventories in 2016 and inventories were about flat in 2017. In addition, price realization was favorable, primarily in Construction Industries. Sales increased 25 percent in Latin America primarily due to stabilizing economic conditions in several countries in the region that resulted in improved end-user demand from low levels and the favorable impact of changes in dealer inventories as inventories decreased in 2016 and increased in 2017. The increase in demand in 2017 led to challenges for certain products due to supplier constraints. Despite improvements in material flows in the second half of 2017, parts and components constraints remain across some products, which could impact the companys growth potential in 2018 as our global suppliers continue to increase production to meet demand. CONSOLIDATED OPERATING PROFIT The chart above graphically illustrates reasons for the change in Consolidated Operating Profit between 2016 (at left) and 2017 (at right). Items favorably impacting operating profit  appear as upward stair steps with the corresponding dollar amounts above each bar, while items negatively impacting operating profit appear as downward stair steps with dollar amounts reflected in parentheses above each bar. Caterpillar management utilizes these charts internally to visually communicate with the company's Board of Directors and employees. The bar entitled Other includes consolidating adjustments and Machinery, Energy  Transportation other operating (income) expenses . Operating profit for 2017 was $4.406 billion, compared with $498 million in 2016. The increase of $3.908 billion was primarily due to higher sales volume, improved price realization, a decrease in mark-to-market losses related to pension and OPEB plans and the absence of a goodwill impairment charge in Resource Industries in 2016. An increase in period costs and restructuring costs was partially offset by lower variable manufacturing costs. Period costs increased primarily due to higher short-term incentive compensation expense, partially offset by the favorable impact of restructuring and cost reduction actions over the past year. These actions primarily impacted depreciation expense and research and development (RD) expenses. Short-term incentive compensation expense is directly related to financial and operational performance, measured against targets set annually. Short-term incentive compensation expense was about $1.4 billion in 2017, significantly above targeted levels, compared to about $250 million in 2016. For 2018, we expect short-term incentive compensation expense will be significantly lower than 2017. In 2017, we incurred $1.256 billion of restructuring costs with about half related to the closure of the facility in Gosselies, Belgium, and the remainder related to other restructuring actions across the company. In 2016, restructuring costs were $1.019 billion, primarily related to Resource Industries and Energy  Transportation. Variable manufacturing costs were lower primarily due to the favorable impact from cost absorption and efficiencies. Cost absorption was favorable as inventory increased in 2017, and decreased in 2016. Material costs were slightly unfavorable in 2017, as higher steel costs were partially offset by cost reduction actions. We expect material costs to be higher in 2018, primarily due to anticipated increases in commodity prices. Other Profit/Loss Items ##TABLE_START  Other income/expense in 2017 was income of $207 million, compared with income of $146 million in 2016. The improvement was primarily due to a pretax gain on the sale of Caterpillar's equity investment in IronPlanet, gains on sale of securities and an increase in interest income. The favorable change was partially offset by an unfavorable net impact from currency translation and hedging gains and losses. Currency translation and hedging net losses in 2017 were significantly higher than the net losses in 2016. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  The provision for income taxes for 2017 reflects an annual effective tax rate of 27.7 percent, compared to 36.4 percent for the full-year 2016, excluding the items discussed below. The effective tax rate related to 2017 full-year ##TABLE_ENDadjusted profit before tax, excluding a discrete benefit from stock-based compensation awards, was 27 percent, compared to 26 percent in 2016. The provision for income taxes for 2017 also includes a charge of $2.371 billion due to the enactment of U.S. tax reform legislation on December 22, 2017. The provisionally estimated charge includes a $596 million write-down of net deferred tax assets to reflect the reduction in the U.S. corporate tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent beginning January 1, 2018, with the remainder primarily related to the cost of a mandatory deemed repatriation of non-U.S. earnings. We believe this charge is a reasonable estimate, as of January 18, 2018, that may change as additional required information is prepared and analyzed, interpretations and assumptions are refined, additional guidance is issued, and due to actions we may take as a result of the legislation. The 2017 provision for income taxes also includes the following: ##TABLE_START  A non-cash benefit of $111 million, net of U.S. federal tax at 35 percent, from reductions in the valuation allowance against U.S. state deferred tax assets due to improved profits in the United States. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  A tax benefit of $64 million for the settlement of stock-based compensation awards with associated tax deductions in excess of cumulative U.S. GAAP compensation expense. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  A charge of $15 million for an increase in prior year taxes related to the Gosselies, Belgium, facility, restructuring costs. ##TABLE_END The provision for income taxes for 2016 also included a non-cash charge of $141 million, net of U.S. federal tax at 35 percent, for increases in the valuation allowance against U.S. state deferred tax assets. We expect the annual effective tax rate will be lower in 2018 as a result of U.S. tax reform.

The increase was due to higher sales volume and favorable price realization. ##TABLE_START  Sales volume increased due to higher end-user demand, primarily for equipment in Asia/Pacific and North America. In addition, sales volume increased due to favorable changes in dealer inventories, as inventories decreased in 2016 and increased in 2017. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Although market conditions remain competitive, price realization was favorable due to a particularly weak pricing environment in 2016, and previously implemented price increases impacting 2017. ##TABLE_END Sales increased across all regions with the largest increases in Asia/Pacific and North America. ##TABLE_START  Sales in Asia/Pacific were higher as a result of an increase in end-user demand, primarily in China, stemming from increased building construction and infrastructure investment. We expect 2018 sales in China to be higher due to continued building construction and infrastructure investment with a strong first half and some tempering in the latter part of the year, largely due to anticipated seasonality. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  In North America, sales increased primarily due to higher end-user demand for construction equipment, mostly due to improved oil and gas, residential and nonresidential construction activities. Also contributing to higher sales was the impact of favorable changes in dealer inventories, as inventories decreased more in 2016 than in 2017, and favorable price realization. We expect improvement in residential, nonresidential and infrastructure construction activities in North America to result in higher end-used demand for construction equipment in 2018. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Sales in EAME increased due to favorable changes in dealer inventories and favorable price realization. The favorable impact of change in dealer inventories resulted from a decrease in 2016 and an increase in 2017. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Although construction activity remained weak in Latin America, sales were higher as end-user demand increased from low levels due to stabilizing economic conditions in several countries in the region. In addition, sales volume increased due to favorable changes in dealer inventories, as dealer inventories increased in 2017 and decreased in 2016. ##TABLE_END Construction Industries profit was $3.258 billion in 2017, compared with $1.650 billion in 2016. The increase in profit was primarily due to higher sales volume and favorable price realization. Period costs were unfavorable primarily due to higher short-term incentive compensation expense, partially offset by lower depreciation expense. Resource Industries Resource Industries sales were $7.504 billion in 2017, an increase of $1.778 billion, or 31 percent, from 2016. Sales increased due to higher end-user demand for aftermarket parts and equipment and the favorable impact of changes in dealer inventories. Positive commodity price trends in 2017 drove improved market conditions and better financial health of mining companies. After a number of years of low investment, miners have begun to increase capital expenditures, reflecting more confidence in their end markets. Idle mining trucks on customer sites also decreased in 2017. These changes resulted in higher sales for aftermarket parts to support increased mining activity as well as maintenance and rebuild activities and, by the second half of 2017, resulted in higher end-user demand for mining equipment. Dealer inventories increased in 2017, compared with a significant decrease in 2016. Resource Industries profit was $690 million in 2017, compared with a loss of $1.047 billion in 2016. The improvement was partially due to the absence of a goodwill impairment charge of $595 million in 2016. Higher sales volume, lower variable manufacturing costs, favorable price realization and lower period costs also contributed to increased profit. Variable manufacturing costs were lower primarily due to a favorable impact from cost absorption and efficiencies. Cost absorption was favorable as inventory increased in 2017, to support higher production volumes and decreased in 2016. Period costs were lower primarily due to the favorable impact of restructuring and cost reduction actions, partially offset by an increase in short-term incentive compensation expense. Energy  Transportation Energy  Transportations sales were $15.964 billion in 2017, compared with $14.411 billion in 2016. The increase was primarily due to higher sales in oil and gas and industrial applications. ##TABLE_START  Oil and Gas - Sales increased in North America due to higher sales of reciprocating engines and aftermarket parts used in on-shore gas compression and well servicing applications. Sales in remaining regions were about flat. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Industrial - Sales were higher in all regions, reflecting increased sales for equipment across end-user applications and aftermarket parts. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Transportation - Sales were higher primarily in North America for rail services driven by increased rail traffic. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Power Generation - Sales were about flat in all regions as the industry remains challenged. ##TABLE_END Sales into Oil and Gas applications are expected to increase in 2018, led by reciprocating engines for gas compression and well servicing in North America. We expect an increase in Transportation primarily from recent acquisitions in rail services. Energy  Transportations profit was $2.883 billion in 2017, compared with $2.222 billion in 2016. The increase was primarily due to higher sales volume and lower variable manufacturing costs, partially offset by higher period costs. Variable manufacturing costs were lower primarily due to a favorable impact from cost absorption and improved material costs. Cost absorption was favorable as inventory increased in 2017, compared to a decrease in 2016. The increase in period costs was primarily due to higher short-term incentive compensation expense. Financial Products Segment Financial Products segment revenues were $3.093 billion, an increase of $100 million, or 3 percent, from 2016. The increase was primarily due to higher average financing rates in North America, a favorable impact from intercompany lending activity in North America and higher average earning assets in EAME. These favorable impacts were partially offset by lower average financing rates in Asia/Pacific and lower average earning assets in North America and Latin America. Financial Products segment profit was $792 million in 2017, compared with $702 million in 2016. The increase was primarily due to higher gains on sales of securities at Insurance Services, an increase in net yield on average earning assets and increased intercompany lending activity. These favorable impacts were partially offset by an increase in SGA expenses due to higher short-term incentive compensation expense. At the end of 2017, past dues at Cat Financial were 2.78 percent, compared with 2.38 percent at the end of 2016. Write-offs, net of recoveries, were $114 million for the full year of 2017, compared with $123 million for the full year of 2016. As of December 31, 2017, Cat Financial's allowance for credit losses totaled $365 million, or 1.33 percent of finance receivables, compared with $343 million, or 1.29 percent of finance receivables at year-end 2016. Corporate Items and Eliminations Expense for corporate items and eliminations was $2.852 billion in 2017, which was an increase of $140 million compared with 2016. Corporate items and eliminations include: corporate-level expenses; restructuring costs; timing differences, as some expenses are reported in segment profit on a cash basis; retirement benefit costs other than service cost; currency differences for MET, as segment profit is reported using annual fixed exchange rates; cost of sales methodology differences as segments use a current cost methodology; and inter-segment eliminations. The increase in expense was a result of methodology differences, higher restructuring costs, timing differences and an increase in short-term incentive compensation expense, mostly offset by lower mark-to-market losses related to pension and OPEB plans. FOURTH QUARTER 2017 COMPARED WITH FOURTH QUARTER 2016  CONSOLIDATED SALES AND REVENUES The chart above graphically illustrates reasons for the change in Consolidated Sales and Revenues between the fourth quarter of 2016 (at left) and the fourth quarter of 2017 (at right). Items favorably impacting sales and revenues appear as upward stair steps with the corresponding dollar amounts above each bar, while items negatively impacting sales and revenues appear as downward stair steps with dollar amounts reflected in parentheses above each bar. Caterpillar management utilizes these charts internally to visually communicate with the company's Board of Directors and employees. Total sales and revenues were $12.896 billion in the fourth quarter of 2017, an increase of $3.322 billion, or 35 percent, compared with $9.574 billion in the fourth quarter of 2016. The increase was primarily due to higher sales volume, mostly due to improved end-user demand. In addition, favorable changes in dealer inventories contributed to increased sales volume. The improvement in end-user demand was across all regions and most end markets. The favorable change in dealer inventories was primarily due to a decrease in the fourth quarter of 2016, compared to dealer inventories that were about flat in the fourth quarter of 2017. Dealer machine and engine inventories were about flat in the fourth quarter of 2017, compared to a decrease of about $800 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. Dealers are independent, and there could be many reasons for changes in their inventory levels, including their expectations of future demand and product delivery times. Dealers demand expectations take into account seasonal changes, macroeconomic conditions, machine rental rates and other factors. Delivery times can vary based on availability of product from Caterpillar factories and product distribution centers. By segment, the largest sales volume increase was in Construction Industries, mostly due to higher end-user demand for construction equipment and the favorable impact of changes in dealer inventories. Energy  Transportations sales volume increased due to higher demand across all applications. Sales volume for Resource Industries increased due to higher end-user demand for equipment and aftermarket parts. Favorable price realization, primarily in Construction Industries and Resource Industries, also contributed to the sales improvement. Financial Products revenues were about flat. Sales increased across all regions with the largest increase in North America. Sales improved 46 percent in North America primarily due to higher end-user demand for both equipment and aftermarket parts. Changes in dealer inventories were favorable as dealer inventories decreased in the fourth quarter of 2016 and increased slightly in the fourth quarter of 2017. EAME sales increased 38 percent primarily due to higher end-user demand for equipment and favorable price realization. Asia/Pacific sales increased 22 percent primarily due to higher end-user demand for construction equipment. About half of the sales improvement in Asia/Pacific was in China resulting from increased building construction and infrastructure investment. Sales increased 39 percent in Latin America due to stabilizing economic conditions in several countries in the region that resulted in improved end-user demand from low levels, as well as favorable changes in dealer inventories. CONSOLIDATED OPERATING PROFIT (LOSS) The chart above graphically illustrates reasons for the change in Consolidated Operating Profit (Loss) between the fourth quarter of 2016 (at left) and the fourth quarter of 2017 (at right). Items favorably impacting operating profit  appear as upward stair steps with the corresponding dollar amounts above each bar, while items negatively impacting operating profit appear as downward stair steps with dollar amounts reflected in parentheses above each bar. Caterpillar management utilizes these charts internally to visually communicate with the company's Board of Directors and employees. The bar entitled Other includes consolidating adjustments and Machinery, Energy  Transportation other operating (income) expenses. Operating profit for the fourth quarter of 2017 was $1.161 billion, compared with a loss of $1.262 billion in the fourth quarter of 2016. The increase of $2.423 billion was due to higher sales volume, a decrease in mark-to-market losses related to pension and OPEB plans and the absence of a goodwill impairment charge in Resource Industries in 2016. Favorable price realization, lower variable manufacturing costs and lower restructuring costs were mostly offset by higher period costs. Price realization was favorable, primarily in Construction Industries and Resource Industries. Variable manufacturing costs were lower primarily due to the favorable impact from cost absorption and lower warranty expense. Cost absorption was favorable as inventory was about flat in the fourth quarter of 2017, compared to a reduction in inventory in the fourth quarter of 2016. Material costs were slightly unfavorable due to increases in steel prices. Period costs were higher primarily due to higher short-term incentive compensation expense. Also contributing to increased period costs were targeted investments and higher manufacturing costs to support higher production volumes, partially offset by lower depreciation expense. Restructuring costs were $245 million in the fourth quarter of 2017, compared with $395 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. Short-term incentive compensation expense was about $350 million in the fourth quarter of 2017, compared to about $50 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. Other Profit/Loss Items ##TABLE_START  Interest expense excluding Financial Products in the fourth quarter of 2017 was $169 million, an increase of $49 million from the fourth quarter of 2016, primarily due to an early debt retirement. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Other income/expense in the fourth quarter of 2017 was income of $119 million, compared with income of $34 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. The favorable change was primarily a result of gains on the sale of securities. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  The provision for income taxes in the fourth quarter reflects an annual effective tax rate of 27.7 percent, compared to 36.4 percent for the full year of 2016, excluding the items discussed below. The effective tax rate related to 2017 full-year adjusted profit before tax, excluding a discrete benefit from stock-based compensation awards, was 27 percent, compared to 26 percent in 2016. ##TABLE_END The provision for income taxes in the fourth quarter of 2017 also includes a charge of $2.371 billion due to the enactment of U.S. tax reform legislation on December 22, 2017. The provisionally estimated charge includes a $596 million write- down of net deferred tax assets to reflect the reduction in the U.S. corporate tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent beginning January 1, 2018, with the remainder primarily related to the cost of a mandatory deemed repatriation of non-U.S. earnings. We believe this charge is a reasonable estimate, as of January 18, 2018, that may change as additional required information is prepared and analyzed, interpretations and assumptions are refined, additional guidance is issued, and due to actions we may take as a result of the legislation. Three items partially offset this charge: ##TABLE_START  A $130 million benefit related to the change from the third-quarter estimated annual tax rate of 32 percent to 27.7 percent for the full year of 2017, primarily due to a more favorable geographic mix of profits from a tax perspective, including the impact of U.S. pension and OPEB mark-to-market losses taxed at higher U.S. rates. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  A non-cash benefit of $111 million, net of U.S. federal tax at 35 percent, from reductions in the valuation allowance against U.S. state deferred tax assets due to improved profits in the United States. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  A tax benefit of $19 million for the settlement of stock-based compensation awards with associated tax deductions in excess of cumulative U.S. GAAP compensation expense. ##TABLE_END The provision for income taxes in the fourth quarter of 2016 also included a charge of $170 million related to the change from the third quarter of 2016 estimated annual tax rate. In addition, the valuation allowance against U.S. state deferred tax assets was increased in 2016, resulting in a $141 million non-cash charge, net of U.S. federal tax at 35 percent.

The increase was due to higher sales volume and favorable price realization. ##TABLE_START  Sales volume increased primarily due to higher end-user demand for construction equipment. In addition, there was a favorable impact from changes in dealer inventories as inventories decreased more in the fourth quarter of 2016 than in the fourth quarter of 2017. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Price realization was favorable due to a weak pricing environment in the fourth quarter of 2016 and previously implemented price increases. ##TABLE_END Sales increased across all regions with the largest increases in North America and Asia/Pacific. ##TABLE_START  In North America, the sales increase was due to higher end-user demand for construction equipment, mostly due to oil and gas, residential and non-residential construction activities. The impact of favorable changes in dealer inventories, as inventories decreased in the fourth quarter of 2016 and were about flat in the fourth quarter of 2017, also contributed to increased sales. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Sales in Asia/Pacific were higher as a result of an increase in end-user demand, primarily in China, stemming from increased building construction and infrastructure investment. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Sales increased in EAME primarily due to higher end-user demand for construction equipment, reflecting improved economic conditions across much of the region. Favorable price realization also contributed to increased sales. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Although construction activity remained weak in Latin America, sales were higher as end-user demand increased from low levels due to stabilizing economic conditions in several countries in the region. ##TABLE_END Construction Industries profit was $838 million in the fourth quarter of 2017, compared with $334 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. The increase in profit was primarily due to higher sales volume, favorable price realization and variable manufacturing efficiencies, partially offset by unfavorable period costs and higher material costs, primarily for steel. The increase in period costs was due to higher short-term incentive compensation expense, targeted investments and higher manufacturing period costs to support increased production volumes. Resource Industries Resource Industries sales were $2.205 billion in the fourth quarter of 2017, an increase of $762 million from the fourth quarter of 2016. The increase was primarily due to higher end-user demand for equipment and aftermarket parts in all regions, favorable impact of changes in dealer inventories and favorable price realization. Dealer deliveries for new equipment increased significantly. Positive commodity price trends in 2017 drove improved market conditions and better financial health of mining companies. After several years of low investment, miners began to increase capital expenditures, reflecting more confidence in their end markets. Dealer inventories increased slightly in the fourth quarter of 2017, compared with a slight decrease in the fourth quarter of 2016. Resource Industries profit was $209 million in the fourth quarter of 2017, compared with a loss of $711 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. The improvement was primarily due to the absence of a goodwill impairment charge of $595 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. Higher sales volume and favorable price realization also contributed to increased profit. Energy  Transportation Energy  Transportations sales were $4.706 billion in the fourth quarter of 2017, compared with $3.849 billion in the fourth quarter of 2016. The increase was primarily due to higher sales volume across all applications. ##TABLE_START  Oil and Gas - Sales increased primarily due to higher demand for equipment used in gas compression and well servicing applications in North America. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Transportation - Sales were higher primarily in North America for rail services, driven by increased rail traffic, and due to additional deliveries of freight locomotives. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Industrial - Sales were higher primarily in EAME due to increased demand for equipment used in electric power and agricultural end-user applications and aftermarket parts. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Power Generation - Sales increased primarily in EAME due to the timing of projects. ##TABLE_END Energy  Transportations profit was $881 million in the fourth quarter of 2017, compared with $638 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. The increase was primarily due to higher sales volume, partially offset by higher period costs. The increase in period costs was primarily due to higher short-term incentive compensation expense, costs associated with higher production and targeted investments. Financial Products Segment Financial Products segment revenues were $783 million in the fourth quarter of 2017, an increase of $41 million, or 6 percent, from the fourth quarter of 2016. The increase was primarily due to higher average financing rates in North America, higher average earning assets in EAME and Asia/Pacific and a favorable impact from intercompany lending activity in North America. These favorable impacts were partially offset by lower average financing rates in Asia/Pacific. Financial Products segment profit was $233 million in the fourth quarter of 2017, compared with $149 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. The increase was primarily due to higher gains on sales of securities at Insurance Services and an increase in net yield on average earning assets. Corporate Items and Eliminations Expense for corporate items and eliminations was $898 million in the fourth quarter of 2017, a decrease of $683 million from the fourth quarter of 2016. Corporate items and eliminations include: restructuring costs; corporate-level expenses; timing differences, as some expenses are reported in segment profit on a cash basis; retirement benefit costs other than service cost; currency differences for MET, as segment profit is reported using annual fixed exchange rates; cost of sales methodology differences, as segments use a current cost methodology; and inter-segment eliminations. The decrease in expense was primarily due to the favorable impact of lower mark-to-market losses related to pension and OPEB plans and lower restructuring costs, partially offset by methodology differences and higher short-term incentive compensation expense. Mark-to-market losses in the fourth quarter of 2017 were $301 million, compared to mark-to-market losses of $985 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. 2016 COMPARED WITH 2015  CONSOLIDATED SALES AND REVENUES The chart above graphically illustrates reasons for the change in Consolidated Sales and Revenues between 2015 (at left) and 2016 (at right). Items favorably impacting sales and revenues appear as upward stair steps with the corresponding dollar amounts above each bar, while items negatively impacting sales and revenues appear as downward stair steps with dollar amounts reflected in parentheses above each bar. Caterpillar management utilizes these charts internally to visually communicate with the company's Board of Directors and employees.  Total sales and revenues were $38.537 billion in 2016, compared with $47.011 billion in 2015, a decline of $8.474 billion, or 18 percent. The decrease was primarily due to lower sales volume attributable to continued weak commodity prices globally and economic weakness in many countries. While sales for both new equipment and aftermarket parts declined, most of the decrease was for new equipment. The unfavorable impact of price realization, primarily in Construction Industries, also contributed to the decline. Sales volume was also unfavorably impacted by changes in dealer machine and engine inventories as inventories decreased about $1.6 billion in 2016 compared with a decrease of about $1.0 billion in 2015. The unfavorable impact of changes in dealer inventories was primarily in North America. Dealers are independent, and there could be many reasons for changes in their inventory levels, including their expectations of future demand and product delivery times. Dealers demand expectations take into account seasonal changes, macroeconomic conditions, machine rental rates and other factors. Delivery times can vary based on availability of product from Caterpillar factories and product distribution centers. We believe some of the expected dealer inventory reduction is a result of increased machine availability through our factories and product distribution centers. Sales declined in all regions. In North America, sales decreased 19 percent due to lower end-user demand primarily driven by Construction Industries and Energy  Transportation, and the unfavorable impact of changes in dealer inventories, primarily in Construction Industries. In EAME, sales declined 22 percent, primarily in Africa/Middle East due to weak economic conditions resulting from low oil and other commodity prices and an uncertain investment environment. Sales decreased 29 percent in Latin America, primarily due to widespread economic weakness across the region. The most significant decreases were in Mexico and Brazil. Asia/Pacific sales declined 9 percent, primarily due to lower end-user demand for Energy  Transportation applications and products used in mining, partially offset by an increase in demand for construction equipment mostly in China. Energy  Transportations sales declined 22 percent, largely due to lower end-user demand for oil and gas and transportation applications. Construction Industries sales decreased 12 percent due to lower demand from end users, unfavorable price realization and the unfavorable impact of changes in dealer inventories. Resource Industries sales declined 26 percent, mostly due to continued low end-user demand. Financial Products segment revenues were about flat.  CONSOLIDATED OPERATING PROFIT The chart above graphically illustrates reasons for the change in Consolidated Operating Profit between 2015 (at left) and 2016 (at right). Items favorably impacting operating profit appear as upward stair steps with the corresponding dollar amounts above each bar, while items negatively impacting operating profit appear as downward stair steps with dollar amounts reflected in parentheses above each bar. Caterpillar management utilizes these charts internally to visually communicate with the company's Board of Directors and employees. The bar entitled Other includes consolidating adjustments and Machinery, Energy  Transportation other operating (income) expenses.  Operating profit for 2016 was $498 million, compared with $3.785 billion in 2015. The decrease in profit was primarily due to lower sales volume, including an unfavorable mix of products. The decrease in profit also included an unfavorable impact from mark-to-market losses related to remeasurement of our pension and OPEB plans and a goodwill impairment charge in Resource Industries. In addition, price realization, Financial Products and restructuring costs were unfavorable. These items were partially offset by favorable period costs and variable manufacturing costs. The unfavorable price realization resulted from competitive market conditions, primarily in Construction Industries. We saw competitive pressure during 2016 that started in the last half of 2015 driven by excess industry capacity, unfavorable currency pressure as the impact of the strong dollar benefited competitors based outside the United States and an overall weak economic environment. Period costs were lower, primarily due to the impact from substantial restructuring and cost reduction actions and lower short-term incentive compensation expense. The reductions primarily impacted period manufacturing costs and selling, general and administrative expenses (SGA). Variable manufacturing costs were favorable primarily due to improved material costs and the favorable impact of cost absorption. Cost absorption was favorable due to inventory decreasing more significantly in 2015 than in 2016. Restructuring costs of $1.019 billion in 2016 were related to multiple restructuring actions across the company, primarily in Resource Industries and Energy  Transportation. In 2015, restructuring costs were $898 million. Short-term incentive compensation expense is directly related to financial and operational performance measured against targets set annually. Expense in 2016 was about $250 million as compared to about $585 million in 2015. Other Profit/Loss Items Other income/expense in 2016 was income of $146 million, compared with income of $161 million in 2015. The unfavorable change was primarily due to the absence of a gain of $120 million on the sale of the remaining 35 percent interest in our former third-party logistics business. This was mostly offset by a favorable net impact from currency translation and hedging gains and losses. Currency translation and hedging net losses in 2016 were significantly less than the net losses in 2015. The provision for income taxes for 2016 reflects an annual effective tax rate of 36.4 percent compared to 25.5 percent for 2015, excluding the items discussed in the paragraph below. The increase was primarily due to the negative impact from the portion of the Surface Mining  Technology goodwill impairment not deductible for tax purposes offsetting a favorable geographic mix of profits from a tax perspective. The effective tax rate related to 2016 full-year adjusted profit before tax was 26 percent. The provision for income taxes for 2016 also included a $141 million non-cash charge for increases in the valuation allowance for U.S. state deferred tax assets due to recent U.S. GAAP losses that were expected to recur in 2017 in certain state jurisdictions and the weight given this negative objective evidence under income tax accounting guidance. The provision for income taxes for 2015 also included a $42 million net charge to adjust prior years U.S. taxes.

The decrease in sales was primarily due to lower volume and unfavorable price realization. While sales declined for both new equipment and aftermarket parts, most of the decrease was for new equipment. ##TABLE_START  The sales volume decline was primarily due to a decrease in deliveries to end users and the unfavorable impact of changes in dealer inventories. Dealers lowered inventories more significantly in 2016 than in 2015. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Price realization was unfavorable $539 million due to competitive market conditions resulting from excess industry capacity and an overall weak economic environment. ##TABLE_END Sales decreased in North America, EAME and Latin America and were higher in Asia/Pacific. ##TABLE_START  In North America, the sales decline was primarily due to lower end-user demand. The sales decline was also due to a decrease in dealer inventories in 2016 compared to relatively flat inventories in 2015. Unfavorable price realization resulted from competitive market conditions. The availability of used equipment negatively impacted sales in North America during 2016. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Lower sales in EAME were primarily due to lower end-user demand and the unfavorable impact of changes in dealer inventories. In addition, price realization was unfavorable across the region due to competitive market conditions. Dealer inventories decreased in 2016 while inventories remained flat in 2015. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  In Latin America, end-user demand was down across most of the region, with the most significant decline in Brazil due to weak economic conditions. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Sales in Asia/Pacific were higher as a result of an increase in end-user demand primarily in China stemming from increased government support in infrastructure and residential investment. In addition, the impact of changes in dealer inventories was favorable as inventories increased slightly in 2016 compared to a decrease in inventories in 2015. ##TABLE_END Construction Industries profit was $1.650 billion in 2016, compared with $1.865 billion in 2015. The decrease in profit was primarily due to lower sales volume and unfavorable price realization resulting from competitive market conditions. The decline was partially offset by favorable costs, primarily due to the impact from restructuring and cost reduction actions, improved material costs, the favorable impact of cost absorption and the absence of an unfavorable impact from litigation in 2015. The impact of cost absorption was favorable as inventory decreased more significantly in 2015 than in 2016. Resource Industries Resource Industries sales were $5.726 billion in 2016, a decrease of $2.013 billion, or 26 percent, from 2015. The decline was almost entirely due to lower sales volume. Sales were lower for both new equipment and aftermarket parts, however, most of the decrease was for new equipment. Aftermarket parts sales increased sequentially in each of the last three quarters of 2016. The sales decrease was primarily due to lower end-user demand across all regions. While most commodity prices improved in the fourth quarter over a year earlier, current prices were not sufficient to drive an increase in short-term demand for new equipment. We believe idle mining trucks on customer sites also had a negative impact on end-user demand. In 2016, mining customers continued to focus on improving productivity in existing mines and reducing their total capital expenditures, as they had for several years. Resource Industries incurred a loss of $1.047 billion in 2016, compared with profit of $1 million in 2015. The most significant item impacting 2016 was a goodwill impairment charge of $595 million related to the Surface Mining  Technology reporting unit. Excluding the impairment charge, the remaining unfavorable change was mostly due to lower sales volume and unfavorable price realization. These items were partially offset by lower costs due to the impact from restructuring and cost reduction actions, improved material costs and lower short-term incentive compensation expense. Energy  Transportation Energy  Transportations sales were $14.411 billion in 2016, a decrease of $4.108 billion, or 22 percent, from 2015. The decrease was almost entirely the result of lower sales volume. Sales decreased in all applications with oil and gas and transportation representing nearly 80 percent of the Energy  Transportation decline. ##TABLE_START  Oil and Gas - Sales continued to decrease in all regions due to low oil prices. Although oil prices were low in 2015 and 2016, our sales during the first half of 2015 benefited from a strong order backlog. The sales decline was most significant in equipment used for production, drilling and well servicing. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Transportation - Sales decreased in all geographic regions. The most significant decline was in North America, primarily due to significant weakness in the rail industry. Rail remains challenged with low traffic volume and a significant number of idle locomotives. We believe our sales into the rail industry, including rail services and aftermarket, are being negatively impacted by idled fleets resulting from weak commodity prices. In Asia/Pacific, the decrease was due to the absence of a large sale of locomotives in 2015 and a decline in demand for equipment used in marine applications, primarily for work boats. Demand in Latin America and EAME were also negatively impacted by the weakness in the rail industry. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Power Generation - Sales decreased in all regions, but primarily in EAME. The decline in EAME was primarily a result of continued weakness in the Middle East with continued low oil prices limiting investments. The declines in both North America and Asia/Pacific were primarily due to the absence of several large projects and weakness in power generation demand for oil and gas development. The decline in Latin America was primarily due to weak economic conditions. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  I ndustrial - Sales were lower in EAME, North America and Latin America and about flat in Asia Pacific. The decline in sales was primarily due to lower end-user demand for most industrial applications. ##TABLE_END Energy  Transportations profit was $2.222 billion in 2016, compared with $3.390 billion in 2015. The decline was due to a decrease in sales volume, including an unfavorable mix of products. This was partially offset by lower costs primarily due to restructuring and cost reduction actions, favorable material costs and lower short-term incentive compensation expense. Financial Products Segment Financial Products revenues were $2.993 billion, a decrease of $85 million, or 3 percent, from 2015. The decline was primarily due to lower average earning assets in Asia/Pacific and Latin America, an unfavorable impact from returned or repossessed equipment, primarily in North America and lower average financing rates in Latin America. These decreases were partially offset by higher average financing rates and higher average earning assets in North America. Financial Products profit was $702 million in 2016, compared with $809 million in 2015. The decrease was primarily due to an unfavorable impact from returned or repossessed equipment, an unfavorable impact from lower average earning assets, a decrease in net yield on average earning assets reflecting geographic mix changes and an increase in the provision for credit losses at Cat Financial. These unfavorable impacts were partially offset by a decrease in SGA expenses. At the end of 2016, past dues at Cat Financial were 2.38 percent, compared with 2.14 percent at the end of 2015. The increase in past dues was primarily driven by the European marine portfolio. Write-offs, net of recoveries, were $123 million for the full-year 2016, compared with $155 million for the full-year 2015. As of December 31, 2016, Cat Financial's allowance for credit losses totaled $343 million, or 1.29 percent of net finance receivables, compared with $338 million, or 1.22 percent of net finance receivables at year-end 2015. Corporate Items and Eliminations Expense for corporate items and eliminations was $2.712 billion in 2016, which was an increase of $766 million compared with 2015. Corporate items and eliminations include: corporate-level expenses; restructuring costs; timing differences, as some expenses are reported in segment profit on a cash basis; retirement benefit costs other than service cost; currency differences for MET, as segment profit is reported using annual fixed exchange rates; cost of sales methodology differences as segments use a current cost methodology; and inter-segment eliminations. The most significant item was the unfavorable impact of mark-to-market losses related to remeasurement of our pension and OPEB plans. Mark-to-market losses in 2016 were $985 million compared to mark-to-market losses of $179 million in 2015. The remaining decrease in expense of $40 million was primarily due to a favorable impact from methodology differences, partially offset by a $121 million increase in restructuring costs. RESTRUCTURING COSTS Restructuring costs for 2017, 2016 and 2015 were as follows: ##TABLE_START        (Millions of dollars)    Employee separations 1  $  $  $ Contract terminations 1     Long-lived asset impairments 1    Defined benefit plan curtailments and termination benefits 1    Other 2    Total restructuring costs  $ 1,256  $ 1,019  $        1 Recognized in Other operating (income) expenses.       2 Represents costs related to our restructuring programs, primarily for accelerated depreciation, project management costs, equipment relocation and inventory write-downs, and also LIFO inventory decrement benefits from inventory liquidations at closed facilities (all of which are primarily included in Cost of goods sold).        ##TABLE_ENDIn 2017, about half of the restructuring costs were related to the closure of the facility in Gosselies, Belgium, within Construction Industries, and the remainder was related to other restructuring actions across the company. The restructuring costs in 2016 were primarily related to actions in Resource Industries in response to continued weakness in the mining industry. In addition, costs in 2016 resulted from our decision to discontinue production of on-highway vocational trucks within Energy  Transportation and other restructuring actions across the company. The restructuring costs in 2015 were primarily related to several restructuring programs across the company. Restructuring costs are a reconciling item between Segment profit and Consolidated profit before taxes. The following table summarizes the 2016 and 2017 employee separation activity: ##TABLE_START   (Millions of dollars)  Liability balance at December 31, 2015 $ Increase in liability (separation charges) Reduction in liability (payments) (633 ) Liability balance at December 31, 2016 $ Increase in liability (separation charges) Reduction in liability (payments) (423 ) Liability balance at December 31, 2017 $   ##TABLE_END Most of the remaining liability balance as of December 31, 2017 is expected to be paid in 2018 and primarily includes employee separation payments related to closure of the Gosselies, Belgium, facility. In March 2017, Caterpillar informed Belgian authorities of the decision to proceed to a collective dismissal, which will lead to the closure of the Gosselies site, impacting about 2,000 employees. Production of Caterpillar products at the Gosselies site ended during the second quarter of 2017. The other operations and functions at the Gosselies site are expected to be gradually phased out by the end of the second quarter of 2018. We estimate restructuring costs incurred under this program to be about $675 million. In 2017, we recognized $653 million of restructuring costs which included $436 million of employee separation costs, $205 million for long-lived asset impairments and $77 million of other costs partially offset by a $65 million LIFO inventory decrement benefit. The remaining costs are expected to be recognized in 2018. Restructuring costs for the year ended December 31, 2016 were $1,019 million. Throughout 2016, we initiated the following restructuring plans: ##TABLE_START  In February 2016, we made the decision to discontinue production of on-highway vocational trucks. Based on the business climate in the truck industry and a thorough evaluation of the business, the company decided it would withdraw from this market. We recognized $104 million of restructuring costs, primarily related to long-lived asset impairments and sales discounts, which is substantially all the costs expected under this program. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  In the second half of 2016, we took additional restructuring actions in Resource Industries, including ending the production of track drills; pursuing strategic alternatives related to room and pillar products; consolidation of two product development divisions; and additional actions in response to ongoing weakness in the mining industry. For the year ended December 31, 2016, we incurred $369 million of restructuring costs for these plans primarily related to long-lived asset impairments, employee separation costs and inventory write-downs. ##TABLE_END In September 2015, we announced a large scale restructuring plan (the Plan) including a voluntary retirement enhancement program for qualifying U.S. employees, several voluntary separation programs outside of the U.S., additional involuntary programs throughout the company and manufacturing facility consolidations and closures expected to occur through 2018. The largest action among those included in the Plan was related to our European manufacturing footprint which led to the Gosselies, Belgium, facility closure as discussed above. We incurred $817 million, $281 million and $569 million in 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively, for a total of $1,667 million. We expect to recognize approximately $200 million of additional restructuring costs related to the Plan in 2018.  In 2018, we expect to incur about $400 million of restructuring costs primarily related to ongoing manufacturing facility consolidations to achieve a flexible and competitive cost structure. We are expecting about $250 million of cost reduction in 2018 from lower operating costs, primarily SGA expenses and Cost of goods sold resulting from restructuring actions.

On a consolidated basis, we ended 2017 with $8.26 billion of cash, an increase of $1.09 billion from year-end 2016. We intend to maintain a strong cash and liquidity position. Our cash balances are held in numerous locations throughout the world with approximately $7.5 billion held by our non-U.S. subsidiaries. U.S. tax reform legislation enacted on December 22, 2017 resulted in a one-time mandatory deemed repatriation of non-U.S. earnings. The resulting U.S. tax liability, net of available foreign tax credits, will be payable over eight years, and is not expected to significantly impact liquidity. As a result of this legislation, we expect to be able to use cash held by non-U.S. subsidiaries in the United States in the future with minimal U.S. tax consequences.  Consolidated operating cash flow for 2017 was $5.70 billion, up slightly from $5.64 billion in 2016. The increase was due to higher profit in 2017 adjusted for non-cash items including a charge related to the enactment of U.S. tax reform legislation and higher short-term incentive compensation expense accruals. The most significant driver of higher profit was an increase in sales volume in 2017. This improvement was offset by higher working capital requirements and higher pension contributions in 2017. Within working capital, changes to inventory and receivables unfavorably impacted cash flow but were partially offset by changes to accounts payable. These changes to working capital were primarily a result of higher sales volume in 2017 compared to a decrease in sales volume during 2016. In addition, the timing of employee separation payments for 2015 restructuring actions and lower short-term incentive compensation payments in 2017 versus 2016 favorably impacted operating cash flow. See further discussion of operating cash flow under MET and Financial Products. Total debt as of December 31, 2017 was $34.88 billion, a decrease of $1.91 billion from year-end 2016. Debt related to Financial Products decreased $689 million. Debt related to MET decreased $1.22 billion in 2017, primarily due to the early redemption of a long term debt issuance. On October 10, 2017, we called for redemption of all $900 million in aggregate principal amount of our outstanding 7.90% senior notes due in December 2018, payable in cash. The redemption date occurred on November 10, 2017 and included a prepayment fee of $58 million.  We have three global credit facilities with a syndicate of banks totaling $10.50 billion (Credit Facility) available in the aggregate to both Caterpillar and Cat Financial for general liquidity purposes. Based on management's allocation decision, which can be revised from time to time, the portion of the Credit Facility available to MET as of December 31, 2017 was $2.75 billion. Our three Credit Facilities are: ##TABLE_START  The 364-day facility of $3.15 billion (of which $0.82 billion is available to MET) expires in September 2018. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  The three-year facility, as amended in September 2017, of $2.73 billion (of which $0.72 billion is available to MET) expires in September 2020. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  The five-year facility, as amended in September 2017, of $4.62 billion (of which $1.21 billion is available to MET) expires in September 2022. ##TABLE_END At December 31, 2017, Caterpillar's consolidated net worth was $13.72 billion, which was above the $9.00 billion required under the Credit Facility. The consolidated net worth is defined as the consolidated shareholder's equity including preferred stock but excluding the pension and other postretirement benefits balance within Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). At December 31, 2017, Cat Financial's covenant interest coverage ratio was 1.88 to 1. This is above the 1.15 to 1 minimum ratio, calculated as (1) profit excluding income taxes, interest expense and net gain/(loss) from interest rate derivatives to (2) interest expense calculated at the end of each calendar quarter for the rolling four quarter period then most recently ended, required by the Credit Facility. In addition, at December 31, 2017, Cat Financial's six-month covenant leverage ratio was 7.38 to 1 and year-end covenant leverage ratio was 7.71 to 1. This is below the maximum ratio of debt to net worth of 10 to 1, calculated (1) on a monthly basis as the average of the leverage ratios determined on the last day of each of the six preceding calendar months and (2) at each December 31, required by the Credit Facility. In the event Caterpillar or Cat Financial does not meet one or more of their respective financial covenants under the Credit Facility in the future (and are unable to obtain a consent or waiver), the syndicate of banks may terminate the commitments allocated to the party that does not meet its covenants. Additionally, in such event, certain of Cat Financial's other lenders under other loan agreements where similar financial covenants or cross default provisions are applicable, may, at their election, choose to pursue remedies under those loan agreements, including accelerating the repayment of outstanding borrowings. At December 31, 2017, there were no borrowings under the Credit Facility. Our total credit commitments and available credit as of December 31, 2017 were: ##TABLE_START          December 31, 2017 (Millions of dollars)  Consolidated  Machinery, Energy  Transportation  Financial Products Credit lines available:       Global credit facilities  $ 10,500  $ 2,750  $ 7,750 Other external  4,591   4,590 Total credit lines available  15,091  2,751  12,340 Less: Commercial paper outstanding  (3,680 )    (3,680 ) Less: Utilized credit  (1,479 )  (1 )  (1,478 ) Available credit  $ 9,932  $ 2,750  $ 7,182        ##TABLE_END The other consolidated credit lines with banks as of December 31, 2017 totaled $4.59 billion. These committed and uncommitted credit lines, which may be eligible for renewal at various future dates or have no specified expiration date, are used primarily by our subsidiaries for local funding requirements. Caterpillar or Cat Financial may guarantee subsidiary borrowings under these lines.  We receive debt ratings from the major rating agencies. In December 2016, Moody's Investors Service downgraded our long-term ratings to A3 from A2, and short-term ratings to Prime-2 from Prime-1. The Moody's downgrade did not have a material impact on our borrowing costs or our overall financial health. A further downgrade of our credit ratings by Moody's or one of the other major credit rating agencies would result in increased borrowing costs and could make access to certain credit markets more difficult. However, our long-term ratings with Fitch and SP continue to be \"mid-A\". In the event economic conditions deteriorate such that access to debt markets becomes unavailable, our MET operations would rely on cash flow from operations, use of existing cash balances, borrowings from Cat Financial and access to our Credit Facility. Our Financial Products operations would rely on cash flow from its existing portfolio, existing cash balances, access to our Credit Facility and other credit line facilities of Cat Financial and potential borrowings from Caterpillar. In addition, we maintain a support agreement with Cat Financial, which requires Caterpillar to remain the sole owner of Cat Financial and may, under certain circumstances, require Caterpillar to make payments to Cat Financial should Cat Financial fail to maintain certain financial ratios. Machinery, Energy  Transportation  Net cash provided by operating activities was $5.46 billion in 2017, compared with $3.89 billion in 2016. The increase was primarily due to higher profit in 2017 adjusted for non-cash items including a charge related to the enactment of U.S. tax reform legislation and higher short-term incentive compensation expense. The most significant driver of higher profit was an increase in sales volume in 2017. This improvement was offset by higher working capital requirements and higher pension contributions in 2017. Within working capital, changes to inventory and receivables unfavorably impacted cash flow but were partially offset by changes to accounts payable. These changes to working capital were primarily a result of higher sales volume in 2017 compared to a decrease in sales volume during 2016. In addition, the timing of employee separation payments for 2015 restructuring actions and lower short-term incentive compensation payments in 2017 versus 2016 favorably impacted operating cash flow. Net cash used for investing activities in 2017 was $760 million, compared with net cash used of $1.78 billion in 2016. The change was primarily due to MET lending activity with Financial Products that occurred in 2016 and lower capital expenditures in 2017. Net cash used for financing activities during 2017 was $2.58 billion, compared with $2.16 billion in the same period of 2016. The change was primarily due to higher payments on debt in 2017, including the early retirement of $900 million of debt due in December 2018, partially offset by proceeds from common stock issued from stock options exercised in 2017.  Our priorities for cash deployment have not changed. While our short-term priorities for the use of cash may vary from time to time as business needs and conditions dictate, our long-term cash deployment strategy is focused on the following priorities. Our top priority is to maintain a strong financial position in support of a Mid-A rating. Next, we intend to fund operational requirements and commitments. Then, we intend to fund priorities that profitably grow the company and return capital to shareholders through dividend growth and share repurchases. Additional information on cash deployment is as follows:  Strong financial position   A key measure of MET's financial strength used by management is MET's debt-to-capital ratio. Debt-to-capital is defined as short-term borrowings, long-term debt due within one year and long-term debt due after one year (debt) divided by the sum of debt and shareholders' equity. Debt also includes MET's long-term borrowings from Financial Products. The debt-to-capital ratio for MET was 36.7 percent at December 31, 2017, within our target range of 30 to 45 percent. MET's debt-to-capital ratio was 41.0 percent at December 31, 2016. The decrease in the debt-to-capital ratio was primarily driven by a decrease in debt which included an early retirement of $900 million of debt due in December 2018. Operational requirements and commitments   Capital expenditures were $916 million during 2017, compared to $1.21 billion for the same period in 2016. We expect MET's capital expenditures in 2018 to be between $1.0 and $1.5 billion. Contributions to our pension and OPEB plans were $1.61 billion and $329 million in 2017 and 2016, respectively. We expect to make approximately $365 million of contributions to our pension and OPEB plans in 2018. We believe we have adequate resources to fund both pension and OPEB plans.  Return capital to shareholders   Dividends totaled $1.83 billion in 2017, representing 77 cents per share paid in the first and second quarters and 78 cents per share paid in the third and fourth quarters. Each quarter, our Board of Directors reviews the company's dividend for the applicable quarter. The Board evaluates the financial condition of the company and considers the economic outlook, corporate cash flow, the company's liquidity needs and the health and stability of global credit markets to determine whether to maintain or change the quarterly dividend. In January 2014, the Board of Directors approved an authorization to repurchase up to $10 billion of Caterpillar common stock (the 2014 Authorization), which will expire on December 31, 2018. We did not purchase any Caterpillar common stock in 2017. As of December 31, 2017, $5.47 billion remained available under the 2014 Authorization. Caterpillar's basic shares outstanding as of December 31, 2017 were approximately 598 million.  Financial Products  Financial Products operating cash flow was $1.35 billion in 2017, compared with $1.55 billion in 2016. Net cash used for investing activities was $591 million in 2017, compared with cash provided by investing activities of $299 million in 2016. The change was primarily due to the impact of net intercompany purchased receivables, partially offset by lower capital expenditures for equipment on operating leases. Net cash used for financing activities in 2017 was $1.82 billion, compared with $1.07 billion in 2016. The change was primarily due to the impact of borrowings with MET. ##TABLE_START Dividends paid per common share        Quarter     First  $ .770  $ .770  $ .700  Second  .770  .770  .700  Third  .780  .770  .770  Fourth  .780  .770  .770    $ 3.100  $ 3.080  $ 2.940            ##TABLE_ENDContractual obligations  The company has committed cash outflow related to long-term debt, operating lease agreements, postretirement benefit obligations, purchase obligations, interest on long-term debt and other long-term contractual obligations. As of December 31, 2017 , minimum payments for these obligations were:  ##TABLE_START (Millions of dollars)   2019-2020  2021-2022  After 2022  Total Long-term debt:           Machinery, Energy  Transportation (excluding capital leases)  $   $   $ 1,870  $ 6,236  $ 8,106 Machinery, Energy  Transportation-capital leases      Financial Products  6,191  9,989  3,826  2,147  22,153 Total long-term debt 1  6,197  10,035  5,724  8,413  30,369 Operating leases                 Postretirement benefit obligations 2    1,020  3,380  5,390 Purchase obligations:           Accounts payable 3  6,487        6,487 Purchase orders 4  7,577        7,577 Other contractual obligations 5       Total purchase obligations  14,301      14,877 Interest on long-term debt 6   1,316   6,138  9,250 Other long-term obligations 7       1,491 Total contractual obligations  $ 22,405  $ 12,997  $ 8,256  $ 18,477  $ 62,135 ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START 1  Amounts exclude unamortized discounts, a non-cash settlement for a capital lease, debt issuance costs, and fair value adjustments. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START 2  Amounts represent expected contributions to our pension and other postretirement benefit plans through 2027, offset by expected Medicare Part D subsidy receipts. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START 3  Amount represents invoices received and recorded as liabilities in 2017, but scheduled for payment in 2018. These represent short-term obligations made in the ordinary course of business. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START 4  Amount represents contractual obligations for material and services on order at December 31, 2017 but not yet delivered. These represent short-term obligations made in the ordinary course of business. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START 5  Amounts represent long-term commitments entered into with key suppliers for minimum purchases quantities. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START 6  Amounts represent estimated contractual interest payments on long-term debt, including capital lease interest payments. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START 7  Amounts represent contractual obligations primarily for logistics services agreements related to our former third party logistics business, software license and development contracts, IT consulting contracts and outsourcing contracts for benefit plan administration and software system support, and estimated income tax payments for mandatory deemed repatriation as a result of U.S. tax reform. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START      ##TABLE_ENDThe total amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits for uncertain tax positions, including positions impacting only the timing of tax benefits, was $1,286 million at December 31, 2017. Payment of these obligations would result from settlements with taxing authorities. Due to the difficulty in determining the timing of settlements, these obligations are not included in the table above. We do not expect to make a tax payment related to these obligations within the next year that would significantly impact liquidity. Off-balance sheet arrangements We are a party to certain off-balance sheet arrangements, primarily in the form of guarantees. Information related to guarantees appears in Note 21  Guarantees and product warranty of Part II, Item 8 Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES  The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts. The more significant estimates include: residual values for leased assets, fair values for goodwill impairment tests, impairment of available-for-sale securities, warranty liability, stock-based compensation, reserves for product liability and insurance losses, postretirement benefits, post-sale discounts, credit losses and income taxes. We have incorporated many years of data into the determination of each of these estimates and we have not historically experienced significant adjustments. These assumptions are reviewed at least annually with the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors. Following are the methods and assumptions used in determining our estimates and an indication of the risks inherent in each.  Residual values for leased assets  The residual values for Cat Financials leased assets, which are an estimate of the market value of leased equipment at the end of the lease term, are based on an analysis of historical wholesale market sales prices, projected forward on a level trend line without consideration for inflation or possible future pricing action. At the inception of the lease, residual values are estimated with consideration of the following critical factors: market size and demand, any known significant market/product trends, total expected hours of usage, machine configuration, application, location, model changes, quantities, past remarketing experience, third-party residual guarantees and contractual customer purchase options. Many of these factors are gathered in an application survey that is completed prior to quotation. The lease agreement also clearly defines applicable return conditions and remedies for non-compliance, to ensure that the leased equipment will be in good operating condition upon return. Model changes and updates, as well as market strength and product acceptance, are monitored and adjustments are made to residual values in accordance with the significance of any such changes. Remarketing sales staff works closely with customers and dealers to manage the sale of lease returns and the recovery of residual exposure. During the term of the equipment on operating leases, we evaluate our depreciation on a regular basis taking into consideration expected residual values at lease termination. Adjustments to depreciation expense reflecting revised estimates of expected residual values at the end of the lease terms are recorded prospectively on a straight-line basis. For finance leases, residual value adjustments are recognized through a reduction of finance revenue. We evaluate the carrying value of equipment on operating leases for potential impairment when we determine a triggering event has occurred. When a triggering event occurs, a test for recoverability is performed by comparing projected undiscounted future cash flows to the carrying value of the equipment on operating leases. If the test for recoverability identifies a possible impairment, the fair value of the equipment on operating leases is measured in accordance with the fair value measurement framework. An impairment charge is recognized for the amount by which the carrying value of the equipment on operating leases exceeds its estimated fair value. At December 31, 2017, the aggregate residual value of equipment on operating leases was $2.20 billion. Without consideration of other factors such as third-party residual guarantees or contractual customer purchase options, a 10% non-temporary decrease in the market value of our equipment subject to operating leases would reduce residual value estimates and result in the recognition of approximately $80 million of additional annual depreciation expense. Fair values for goodwill impairment tests  We test goodwill for impairment annually, at the reporting unit level, and whenever events or circumstances make it more likely than not that an impairment may have occurred, such as a significant adverse change in the business climate or a decision to sell all or a portion of a reporting unit. We perform our annual goodwill impairment test as of October 1 and monitor for interim triggering events on an ongoing basis. Goodwill is reviewed for impairment utilizing either a qualitative assessment or a quantitative goodwill impairment test. If we choose to perform a qualitative assessment and determine the fair value more likely than not exceeds the carrying value, no further evaluation is necessary. For reporting units where we perform the quantitative goodwill impairment test, we compare the fair value of each reporting unit, which we primarily determine using an income approach based on the present value of discounted cash flows, to the respective carrying value, which includes goodwill. If the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying value, the goodwill is not considered impaired. Beginning in 2017, if the carrying value is higher than the fair value, the difference would be recognized as an impairment loss. Prior to 2017, a two-step process was used. For reporting units where we performed the two-step process, the first step required us to compare the fair value of each reporting unit, which we primarily determined using an income approach based on the present value of discounted cash flows, to the respective carrying value, which includes goodwill. If the fair value of the reporting unit exceeded its carrying value, the goodwill was not considered impaired. If the carrying value was higher than the fair value, there was an indication that an impairment may have existed and the second step was required. In step two, the implied fair value of goodwill was calculated as the excess of the fair value of a reporting unit over the fair values assigned to its assets and liabilities. If the implied fair value of goodwill was less than the carrying value of the reporting unit's goodwill, the difference was recognized as an impairment loss. The impairment test process requires valuation of the respective reporting unit, which we primarily determine using an income approach based on a discounted five year forecasted cash flow with a year-five residual value. The residual value is computed using the constant growth method, which values the forecasted cash flows in perpetuity. The income approach is supported by a reconciliation of our calculated fair value for Caterpillar to the company's market capitalization. The assumptions about future cash flows and growth rates are based on each reporting unit's long-term forecast and are subject to review and approval by senior management. A reporting units discount rate is a risk-adjusted weighted average cost of capital, which we believe approximates the rate from a market participant's perspective. The estimated fair value could be impacted by changes in market conditions, interest rates, growth rates, tax rates, costs, pricing and capital expenditures. The fair value determination is categorized as Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy due to its use of internal projections and unobservable measurement inputs. Our annual impairment tests completed in the fourth quarter of 2017 indicated the fair value of each reporting unit was substantially above its respective carrying value, including goodwill. Caterpillars market capitalization has remained significantly above the net book value of the Company. An unfavorable change in our expectations for the financial performance of our reporting units, particularly long-term growth and profitability, would reduce the fair value of our reporting units. The demand for our equipment and related parts is highly cyclical and significantly impacted by commodity prices, although the impact may vary by reporting unit. The energy and mining industries are major users of our products, including the coal, iron ore, gold, copper, oil and natural gas industries. Decisions to purchase our products are dependent upon the performance of those industries, which in turn are dependent in part on commodity prices. Lower commodity prices or industry specific circumstances that have a negative impact to the valuation assumptions may reduce the fair value of our reporting units. Should such events occur and it becomes more likely than not that a reporting unit's fair value has fallen below its carrying value, we will perform an interim goodwill impairment test(s), in addition to the annual impairment test. Future impairment tests may result in a goodwill impairment, depending on the outcome of the quantitative impairment test. A goodwill impairment would be reported as a non-cash charge to earnings.  Impairment of available-for-sale securities   Available-for-sale securities, primarily at Insurance Services, are reviewed at least quarterly to identify fair values below cost which may indicate that a security is impaired and should be written down to fair value.  For debt securities, once a securitys fair value is below cost we utilize data gathered by investment managers, external sources and internal research to monitor the performance of the security to determine whether an other-than-temporary impairment has occurred. These reviews, which include an analysis of whether it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before its anticipated recovery, consist of both quantitative and qualitative analysis and require a degree of management judgment. Securities in a loss position are monitored and assessed at least quarterly based on severity and timing of loss and may be deemed other-than-temporarily impaired at any time. Once a securitys fair value has been 20 percent or more below its original cost for six consecutive months, the security will be other-than-temporarily impaired unless there are sufficient facts and circumstances supporting otherwise.  For equity securities in a loss position, determining whether a security is other-than-temporarily impaired requires an analysis of that security's historical sector return as well as the volatility of that return. This information is utilized to estimate a securitys future fair value and to assess whether the security has the ability to recover to its original cost over a reasonable period of time. Both historical annualized sector returns and the volatility of those returns are applied over a two year period to arrive at these estimates. For both debt and equity securities, qualitative factors are also considered in determining whether a security is other-than-temporarily impaired. These include reviews of the following: significant changes in the regulatory, economic or technological environment of the investee, significant changes in the general market condition of either the geographic area or the industry in which the investee operates, and length of time and the extent to which the fair value has been less than cost. These qualitative factors are subjective and require a degree of management judgment.  Warranty liability  At the time a sale is recognized, we record estimated future warranty costs. The warranty liability is determined by applying historical claim rate experience to the current field population and dealer inventory. Generally, historical claim rates are based on actual warranty experience for each product by machine model/engine size by customer or dealer location (inside or outside North America). Specific rates are developed for each product shipment month and are updated monthly based on actual warranty claim experience. Warranty costs may differ from those estimated if actual claim rates are higher or lower than our historical rates.  Stock-based compensation  We use a lattice-based option-pricing model to calculate the fair value of our stock options and stock appreciation rights (SARs). The calculation of the fair value of the awards using the lattice-based option-pricing model is affected by our stock price on the date of grant as well as assumptions regarding the following:  ##TABLE_START  Volatility is a measure of the amount by which the stock price is expected to fluctuate each year during the expected term of the award and is based on historical Caterpillar stock price movement and current implied volatilities from traded options on Caterpillar stock. The implied volatilities from traded options are impacted by changes in market conditions. An increase in the volatility would result in an increase in our expense. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  The expected term represents the period of time that awards granted are expected to be outstanding and is an output of the lattice-based option-pricing model. In determining the expected term of the award, future exercise and forfeiture patterns are estimated from Caterpillar employee historical exercise behavior. These patterns are also affected by the vesting conditions of the award. Changes in the future exercise behavior of employees or in the vesting period of the award could result in a change in the expected term. An increase in the expected term would result in an increase to our expense. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  The weighted-average dividend yield is based on Caterpillars historical dividend yields. As holders of stock options and SARs do not receive dividend payments, this could result in employees retaining the award for a longer period of time if dividend yields decrease or exercising the award sooner if dividend yields increase. A decrease in the dividend yield would result in an increase in our expense. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  The risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at time of grant. As the risk-free interest rate increases, the expected term increases, resulting in an increase in our expense. ##TABLE_END  The fair value of our RSUs and PRSUs is determined by reducing the stock price on the date of grant by the present value of the estimated dividends to be paid during the vesting period. The estimated dividends are based on Caterpillars quarterly dividend per share at the time of grant. A decrease in the dividend per share would result in an increase in our expense.  Stock-based compensation expense recognized based on the grant date fair value. Forfeitures are accounted for in the period they occur as a reduction to expense. Stock-based compensation expense for PRSUs is based on the probable number of shares expected to vest. Changes in the expected probability of achieving performance targets in future periods may result in an increase or decrease in our expense.  Product liability and insurance loss reserve  We determine these reserves based upon reported claims in process of settlement and actuarial estimates for losses incurred but not reported. Loss reserves, including incurred but not reported reserves, are based on estimates and ultimate settlements may vary significantly from such estimates due to increased claims frequency or severity over historical levels.  Postretirement benefits  Primary actuarial assumptions were determined as follows: ##TABLE_START  The assumed discount rate is used to discount future benefit obligations back to todays dollars. The U.S. discount rate is based on a benefit cash flow-matching approach and represents the rate at which our benefit obligations could effectively be settled as of our measurement date, December 31. The benefit cash flow-matching approach involves analyzing Caterpillars projected cash flows against a high quality bond yield curve, calculated using a wide population of corporate Aa bonds available on the measurement date. The very highest and lowest yielding bonds (top and bottom 10 percent) are excluded from the analysis. A similar approach is used to determine the assumed discount rate for our most significant non-U.S. plans. In estimating the service and interest cost components of net periodic benefit cost, we utilize a full yield curve approach in determining a discount rate. This approach applies the specific spot rates along the yield curve used in the determination of the benefit obligation to the relevant projected cash flows. ##TABLE_END Discount rates are sensitive to changes in interest rates. A decrease in the discount rate would increase our obligation and future expense. ##TABLE_START  The expected long-term rate of return on plan assets is based on our estimate of long-term passive returns for equities and fixed income securities weighted by the allocation of our plan assets. Based on historical performance, we increase the passive returns due to our active management of the plan assets. This rate is impacted by changes in general market conditions, but because it represents a long-term rate, it is not significantly impacted by short-term market swings. Changes in our allocation of plan assets would also impact this rate. For example, a shift to more fixed income securities would lower the rate. A decrease in the rate would increase our expense. The expected return on plan assets is calculated using the fair value of plan assets as of our measurement date, December 31. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  The expected rate of compensation increase is used to develop benefit obligations using projected pay at retirement. It represents average long-term salary increases. This rate is influenced by our long-term compensation policies. An increase in the rate would increase our obligation and expense. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  The assumed health care trend rate represents the rate at which health care costs are assumed to increase and is based on historical and expected experience. Changes in our projections of future health care costs due to general economic conditions and those specific to health care (e.g., technology driven cost changes) will impact this trend rate. An increase in the trend rate would increase our obligation and expense. ##TABLE_END The effects of actual results differing from our assumptions and the effects of changing assumptions are considered actuarial gains or losses. We recognize actuarial gains or losses immediately through earnings upon the annual remeasurement in the fourth quarter, or on an interim basis as triggering events warrant remeasurement. See Note 12 for further information regarding the accounting for postretirement benefits.  Post-sale discount reserve  We provide discounts to dealers through merchandising programs. We have numerous programs that are designed to promote the sale of our products. The most common dealer programs provide a discount when the dealer sells a product to a targeted end user. The amount of accrued post-sale discounts was $1,426 million and $1,288 million as of December 31, 2017 and 2016 , respectively. The reserve represents discounts that we expect to pay on previously sold units and is reviewed at least quarterly. The reserve is adjusted if discounts paid differ from those estimated. Historically, those adjustments have not been material.  Credit loss reserve  The allowance for credit losses is an estimate of the losses inherent in our finance receivable portfolio and includes consideration of accounts that have been individually identified as impaired, as well as pools of finance receivables where it is probable that certain receivables in the pool are impaired but the individual accounts cannot yet be identified. In identifying and measuring impairment, management takes into consideration past loss experience, known and inherent risks in the portfolio, adverse situations that may affect the borrowers ability to repay, estimated value of underlying collateral and current economic conditions. Accounts are identified for individual review based on past-due status and information available about the customer, such as financial statements, news reports and published credit ratings, as well as general information regarding industry trends and the economic environment in which our customers operate. The allowance for credit losses attributable to finance receivables that are individually evaluated and determined to be impaired is based on the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the receivables effective interest rate, the fair value of the collateral for collateral-dependent receivables or the observable market price of the receivable. In determining collateral value, we estimate the current fair market value of the collateral less selling costs. We also consider credit enhancements such as additional collateral and contractual third-party guarantees. The allowance for credit losses attributable to the remaining accounts not yet individually identified as impaired is estimated based on loss forecast models utilizing probabilities of default, our estimate of the loss emergence period and the estimated loss given default. In addition, qualitative factors not able to be fully captured in our loss forecast models including industry trends, macroeconomic factors and model imprecision are considered in the evaluation of the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses. These qualitative factors are subjective and require a degree of management judgment. While management believes it has exercised prudent judgment and applied reasonable assumptions, there can be no assurance that in the future, changes in economic conditions or other factors would not cause changes in the financial health of our customers. If the financial health of our customers deteriorates, the timing and level of payments received could be impacted and therefore, could result in a change to our estimated losses. Income taxes  We are subject to the income tax laws of the many jurisdictions in which we operate. These tax laws are complex, and the manner in which they apply to our facts is sometimes open to interpretation. In establishing the provision for income taxes, we must make judgments about the application of these inherently complex tax laws. Despite our belief that our tax return positions are consistent with applicable tax laws, we believe that taxing authorities could challenge certain positions. Settlement of any challenge can result in no change, a complete disallowance, or some partial adjustment reached through negotiations or litigation. We record tax benefits for uncertain tax positions based upon managements evaluation of the information available at the reporting date. To be recognized in the financial statements, a tax benefit must be at least more likely than not of being sustained based on technical merits. The benefit for positions meeting the recognition threshold is measured as the largest benefit more likely than not of being realized upon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information. Significant judgment is required in making these determinations and adjustments to unrecognized tax benefits may be necessary to reflect actual taxes payable upon settlement. Adjustments related to positions impacting the effective tax rate affect the provision for income taxes. Adjustments related to positions impacting the timing of deductions impact deferred tax assets and liabilities. Income taxes are based on the statutory tax rate of the jurisdiction in which earnings are subject to taxation. That statutory rate may differ from the statutory tax rate of the jurisdiction in which that entity is incorporated. Taxes are paid in the jurisdictions where earnings are subject to taxation. The effective tax rate differs from the U.S. statutory rate in part due to profits of non-U.S. subsidiaries being subject to statutory tax rates which were generally lower than the U.S. rate of 35 percent effective prior to January 1, 2018. Caterpillar SARL (CSARL), primarily taxable locally in Switzerland, contributes the most significant amount of this difference. For tax years 2007 to 2012 including the impact of a loss carryback to 2005, the IRS has proposed to tax in the United States profits earned from certain parts transactions by CSARL based on the IRS examination teams application of substance-over-form or assignment-of-income judicial doctrines. We are vigorously contesting the proposed increases to tax and penalties for these years of approximately $2.3 billion. We believe that the relevant transactions complied with applicable tax laws and did not violate judicial doctrines. The purchase of parts by CSARL from unrelated parties and the subsequent sale of those parts to unrelated dealers outside the United States have substantial legal, commercial, and economic consequences for the parties involved. Therefore, we have concluded that the largest amount of benefit that is more likely than not to be sustained related to this position is the entire benefit. As a result, no amount related to these IRS adjustments is reflected in unrecognized tax benefits. We have filed U.S. income tax returns on this same basis for years after 2012. We currently believe the ultimate disposition of this matter will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position, liquidity or results of operations. Our income tax positions and analysis are based on currently enacted tax law. On December 22, 2017, U.S. tax legislation was enacted containing a broad range of tax reform provisions including a corporate tax rate reduction and changes in the U.S. taxation of non-U.S. earnings. We have not completed our accounting for the income tax effects of U.S. tax reform. However, we have made a reasonable estimate of the 2017 financial statement impact as of January 18, 2018, and recognized a provisional charge of $2.371 billion. We will continue to update our calculations as additional required information is prepared and analyzed, interpretations and assumptions are refined, additional guidance is issued, and due to actions we may take as a result of the legislation. These updates could significantly impact the provision for income taxes, the amount of taxes payable, and the deferred tax asset and liability balances. The provisionally estimated charge includes a $596 million write-down of net deferred tax assets to reflect the reduction in the U.S. corporate tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent beginning January 1, 2018. We are still analyzing certain aspects of the law and refining our calculations of basis differences as of December 31, 2017, which could affect the measurement of these balances. The provisionally estimated charge includes $1.775 billion for the estimated cost of a mandatory deemed repatriation of non-U.S. earnings, including changes in the deferred tax liability related to the amount of earnings considered not indefinitely reinvested as well as the amount of unrecognized tax benefits and state tax liabilities associated with these tax positions. The U.S. federal tax cost for the mandatory deemed repatriation is computed at 15.5 percent for non-U.S. earnings held in liquid assets and 8 percent for non-liquid assets, reduced by applicable foreign tax credits. These estimates are provisional due to additional information and analysis required to determine cumulative taxable earnings since 1986 for non-U.S. subsidiaries at two separate points in time and to determine the amount of earnings that are held in liquid versus non-liquid assets as defined in the new legislation at several different measurement periods. In addition, information is being gathered and analyzed to support available foreign tax credits including estimates of credit utilization and valuation allowance considerations for any remaining foreign tax credit carryforward. Due to uncertainty about aspects of the tax law, we have made various assumptions to determine our reasonable estimate that we expect to refine as additional guidance is issued. As a result of U.S. tax reform legislation, distributions of profits from non-U.S. subsidiaries are not expected to cause a significant U.S. tax impact in the future. However, these distributions may be subject to non-U.S. withholding taxes if profits are distributed from certain jurisdictions. We have recorded a deferred tax liability of $138 million for withholding taxes in non-U.S. jurisdictions where earnings are not considered indefinitely reinvested. Additional information and analysis are needed to determine the final amount of deferred tax liability considering factors such as whether non-U.S. entities are subject to withholding taxes, have reserve requirements, or have projected working capital and other capital needs in the country where the earnings were generated that would result in a decision to indefinitely reinvest a portion or all their earnings. Deferred tax assets generally represent tax benefits for tax deductions or credits available in future tax returns. Certain estimates and assumptions are required to determine whether it is more likely than not that all or some portion of the benefit of a deferred tax asset will not be realized. In making this assessment, management analyzes the trend of U.S. GAAP earnings and estimates the impact of future taxable income, reversing temporary differences and available prudent and feasible tax planning strategies. Should a change in facts or circumstances lead to a change in judgment about the ultimate realizability of a deferred tax asset, we record or adjust the related valuation allowance in the period that the change in facts and circumstances occurs, along with a corresponding increase or decrease in the provision for income taxes. The provision for income taxes for 2016 included an increase in the valuation allowance for U.S. state deferred tax assets resulting in a $141 million non-cash charge, net of federal deferred tax adjustment at 35 percent. The primary driver of the increase was recent U.S. GAAP losses expected to recur in 2017 in certain state jurisdictions and the weight given this negative objective evidence under income tax accounting guidance. Due to better than previously forecasted 2017 U.S. GAAP results in certain U.S. state jurisdictions, the provision for income taxes for 2017 includes a decrease in the valuation allowance for U.S. state deferred tax assets resulting in a $111 million non-cash benefit, net of federal deferred tax adjustment of 35 percent. We give less weight in this analysis to mark-to-market adjustments to remeasure our pension and OPEB plans as we do not consider these adjustments indicative of ongoing earnings trends. OTHER MATTERS  ENVIRONMENTAL AND LEGAL MATTERS The  Company is regulated by federal, state and international environmental laws governing our use, transport and disposal of substances and control of emissions. In addition to governing our manufacturing and other operations, these laws often impact the development of our products, including, but not limited to, required compliance with air emissions standards applicable to internal combustion engines. We have made, and will continue to make, significant research and development and capital expenditures to comply with these emissions standards. We are engaged in remedial activities at a number of locations, often with other companies, pursuant to federal and state laws. When it is probable we will pay remedial costs at a site, and those costs can be reasonably estimated, the investigation, remediation, and operating and maintenance costs are accrued against our earnings. Costs are accrued based on consideration of currently available data and information with respect to each individual site, including available technologies, current applicable laws and regulations, and prior remediation experience. Where no amount within a range of estimates is more likely, we accrue the minimum. Where multiple potentially responsible parties are involved, we consider our proportionate share of the probable costs. In formulating the estimate of probable costs, we do not consider amounts expected to be recovered from insurance companies or others. We reassess these accrued amounts on a quarterly basis. The amount recorded for environmental remediation is not material and is included in Accrued expenses. We believe there is no more than a remote chance that a material amount for remedial activities at any individual site, or at all the sites in the aggregate, will be required. On January 7, 2015, the Company received a grand jury subpoena from the U.S. District Court for the Central District of Illinois. The subpoena requests documents and information from the Company relating to, among other things, financial information concerning U.S. and non-U.S. Caterpillar subsidiaries (including undistributed profits of non-U.S. subsidiaries and the movement of cash among U.S. and non-U.S. subsidiaries). The Company has received additional subpoenas relating to this investigation requesting additional documents and information relating to, among other things, the purchase and resale of replacement parts by Caterpillar Inc. and non-U.S. Caterpillar subsidiaries, dividend distributions of certain non-U.S. Caterpillar subsidiaries, and Caterpillar SARL and related structures. On March 2-3, 2017, agents with the Department of Commerce, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and the Internal Revenue Service executed search and seizure warrants at three facilities of the Company in the Peoria, Illinois area, including its former corporate headquarters. The warrants identify, and agents seized, documents and information related to, among other things, the export of products from the United States, the movement of products between the United States and Switzerland, the relationship between Caterpillar Inc. and Caterpillar SARL, and sales outside the United States. It is the Companys understanding that the warrants, which concern both tax and export activities, are related to the ongoing grand jury investigation. The Company is continuing to cooperate with this investigation. The Company is unable to predict the outcome or reasonably estimate any potential loss; however, we currently believe that this matter will not have a material adverse effect on the Companys consolidated results of operations, financial position or liquidity. On March 20, 2014, Brazils Administrative Council for Economic Defense (CADE) published a Technical Opinion which named 18 companies and over 100 individuals as defendants, including two subsidiaries of Caterpillar Inc., MGE - Equipamentos e Servios Ferrovirios Ltda. (MGE) and Caterpillar Brasil Ltda. The publication of the Technical Opinion opened CADE's official administrative investigation into allegations that the defendants participated in anticompetitive bid activity for the construction and maintenance of metro and train networks in Brazil. While companies cannot be held criminally liable for anticompetitive conduct in Brazil, criminal charges have been brought against two current employees of MGE and one former employee of MGE involving the same conduct alleged by CADE. The Company has responded to all requests for information from the authorities. The Company is unable to predict the outcome or reasonably estimate the potential loss; however, we currently believe that this matter will not have a material adverse effect on the Company's consolidated results of operations, financial position or liquidity. On October 24, 2013, Progress Rail received a grand jury subpoena from the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California related to the former railcar repair operations of its subsidiary, United Industries, LLC (\"United\") at the intermodal rail yard at Terminal Island, California (\"Terminal Island\"). United complied with the subpoena and cooperated with the U.S. Attorney. After investigation, the U.S. Attorney alleged that United engaged in unnecessary and improper railcar repair activities and disposed of railcar parts by hand in the water surrounding its former Terminal Island operation. On December 7, 2017, United entered a guilty plea in U.S. District Court for the Central District of California to a single misdemeanor violation of the Refuse Act. As part of the agreement to enter the plea, United has paid $25 million in fines and restitution. In addition, we are involved in other unresolved legal actions that arise in the normal course of business. The most prevalent of these unresolved actions involve disputes related to product design, manufacture and performance liability (including claimed asbestos and welding fumes exposure), contracts, employment issues, environmental matters, intellectual property rights, tax and securities laws. The aggregate range of reasonably possible losses in excess of accrued liabilities, if any, associated with these unresolved legal actions is not material. In some cases, we cannot reasonably estimate a range of loss because there is insufficient information regarding the matter. However, we believe there is no more than a remote chance that any liability arising from these matters would be material. Although it is not possible to predict with certainty the outcome of these unresolved legal actions, we believe that these actions will not individually or in the aggregate have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations, financial position or liquidity.  RETIREMENT BENEFITS We recognize mark-to-market gains and losses immediately through earnings upon the remeasurement of our pension and OPEB plans. Mark-to-market gains and losses represent the effects of actual results differing from our assumptions and the effects of changing assumptions. Changes in discount rates and differences between the actual return on plan assets and the expected return on plan assets generally have the largest impact on mark-to-market gains and losses. We recognized expense of $342 million in 2017, $957 million in 2016 and $292 million in 2015 related to our defined benefit pension and OPEB plans. The decrease in expense in 2017 compared to 2016 was primarily due to lower net mark-to-market losses in 2017 compared to 2016. This was partially offset by an unfavorable change in amortization of prior service credits, curtailment and termination charges in 2017 related to the Gosselies, Belgium and Aurora, Illinois facility closures and a lower expected return on plan assets. The increase in expense in 2016 compared to 2015 was primarily due to a higher net mark-to-market loss in 2016 compared to 2015 and lower expected return on plan assets as a result of a lower asset base in 2016 compared to 2015 and a lower expected rate of return on plan assets. This was partially offset by lower interest costs primarily due to adoption of a full yield curve approach in the estimation of interest cost (discussed below) and lower service costs primarily due to fewer employees earning benefits under our plans as a result of the U.S. voluntary retirement enhancement program that was implemented in the fourth quarter 2015. The primary factors that resulted in mark-to-market losses for 2017, 2016 and 2015 are described below: ##TABLE_START  2017 net mark-to-market loss of $301 million - Primarily due to lower discount rates at the end of 2017 compared to the end of 2016 and changes in our mortality assumption (discussed below). This was partially offset by the difference between the actual return on plan assets compared to the expected return on plan assets (U.S. pension plans had an actual rate of return of 15.5 percent compared to an expected rate of return of 6.7 percent). ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  2016 net mark-to-market loss of $985 million - Primarily due to lower discount rates at the end of 2016 compared to the end of 2015 and changes in our U.S. mortality assumption (discussed below). This was partially offset by the difference between the actual return on plan assets compared to the expected return on plan assets (U.S. pension plans had an actual rate of return of 7.8 percent compared to an expected rate of return of 6.9 percent). ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  2015 net mark-to-market loss of $179 million - Primarily due to the difference between the actual return on plan assets compared to the expected return on plan assets (U.S. pension plans had an actual rate of return of (2.0) percent compared to an expected rate of return of 7.4 percent) which was partially offset by higher discount rates at the end of 2015 compared to 2014. ##TABLE_END The net mark-to-market losses were in the following Results of Operations line items: ##TABLE_START   Years ended December 31, (Millions of dollars)           Cost of goods sold  $ (29 )  $  $ Selling, general and administrative expenses    Research and development expenses    Total  $  $  $        ##TABLE_ENDEffective January 1, 2018, we adopted new accounting guidance issued by the FASB related to the presentation of net periodic pension and OPEB costs. This guidance requires that an employer disaggregate the service cost component from the other components of net benefit cost. Service cost is required to be reported in the same line item or items as other compensation costs arising from services rendered by the pertinent employees during the period. The other components of net benefit cost are required to be reported outside the subtotal for income from operations. As a result, components of pension and OPEB costs, other than service costs, will be reclassified from operating costs to other income/expense. This change will be applied retrospectively to prior years. In the fourth quarter of 2017, the company reviewed and made changes to the mortality assumptions primarily for our U.S. pension plans which resulted in an overall increase in the life expectancy of plan participants. As of December 31, 2017 these changes resulted in an increase in our Liability for postemployment benefits of approximately $290 million. In the fourth quarter of 2016, the company adopted new mortality improvement scales released by the SoA for our U.S. pension and OPEB plans. As of December 31, 2016, this resulted in an increase in our Liability for postemployment benefits of approximately $200 million. In the first quarter of 2017, we announced the closure of our Gosselies, Belgium facility. This announcement impacted certain employees that participated in a defined benefit pension plan and resulted in a curtailment and the recognition of termination benefits. In March 2017, we recognized a net loss of $20 million for the curtailment and termination benefits. In addition, we announced the decision to phase out production at our Aurora, Illinois, facility, which resulted in termination benefits of $9 million for certain hourly employees that participate in our U.S. hourly defined benefit pension plan. Beginning in 2016, we elected to utilize a full yield curve approach in the estimation of service and interest costs by applying the specific spot rates along the yield curve used in the determination of the benefit obligation to the relevant projected cash flows. Service and interest costs in 2017 and 2016 were lower by $140 million and $180 million, respectively, under the new method than they would have been under the previous method. This change had no impact on our year-end defined benefit pension and OPEB obligations or our annual net periodic benefit cost as the lower service and interest costs were entirely offset in the actuarial loss (gain) reported for the respective year. We expect our total defined benefit pension and OPEB expense (excluding the impact of mark-to-market gains and losses) to decrease approximately $80 million in 2018. This decrease is primarily due to a higher expected return on plan assets as a result of a higher asset base in 2018. In general, our strategy for both the U.S. and the non-U.S. pensions includes ongoing alignment of our investments to our liabilities, while reducing risk in our portfolio. For our U.S. pension plans, our year-end 2017 asset allocation was 34 percent equities, 62 percent fixed income and 4 percent other. Our current U.S. pension target asset allocation is 30 percent equities and 70 percent fixed income. The target allocation is revisited periodically to ensure it reflects our overall objectives. The U.S. plans are rebalanced to plus or minus 5 percentage points of the target asset allocation ranges on a monthly basis. The year-end 2017 asset allocation for our non-U.S. pension plans was 40 percent equities, 53 percent fixed income, 4 percent real estate and 3 percent other. The 2017 weighted-average target allocations for our non-U.S. pension plans was 38 percent equities, 54 percent fixed income, 5 percent real estate and 3 percent other. The target allocations for each plan vary based upon local statutory requirements, demographics of the plan participants and funded status. The frequency of rebalancing for the non-U.S. plans varies depending on the plan. Contributions to our pension and OPEB plans were $1.6 billion and $329 million in 2017 and 2016, respectively. The 2017 contributions include a $1.0 billion discretionary contribution made to our U.S. pension plans in December 2017. We expect to make approximately $365 million of contributions to our pension and OPEB plans in 2018. We believe we have adequate resources to fund both pension and OPEB plans. Actuarial assumptions have a significant impact on both pension and OPEB expenses. The effects of a one percentage point change in our primary actuarial assumptions on 2017 benefit costs and year-end obligations are included in the table below. ##TABLE_START      ##TABLE_ENDPostretirement Benefit Plan Actuarial Assumptions Sensitivity  Following are the effects of a one percentage-point change in our primary pension and OPEB actuarial assumptions (included in the following table) on 2017 pension and other OPEB costs and obligations:  ##TABLE_START   2017 Benefit Cost  Year-end Benefit Obligation (Millions of dollars)  One percentage- point increase  One percentage- point decrease  One percentage- point increase  One percentage- point decrease Pension benefits:         Assumed discount rate  $  $ (83 )  $ (2,561 )  $ 3,167 Expected rate of compensation increase   (7 )   (70 ) Expected long-term rate of return on plan assets  (149 )      Other postretirement benefits:         Assumed discount rate   (12 )  (366 )  Expected rate of compensation increase       (1 ) Expected long-term rate of return on plan assets  (5 )      Assumed health care cost trend rate   (12 )   (136 )          ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START Primary Actuarial Assumptions                      U.S. Pension Benefits  Non-U.S. Pension Benefits  Other Postretirement Benefits           Weighted-average assumptions used to determine benefit obligations, end of year:                   Discount rate  3.5 %  4.0 %  4.2 %  2.4 %  2.5 %  3.2 %  3.6 %  4.0 %  4.1 % Rate of compensation increase  4.0 %  4.0 %  4.0 %  4.0 %  4.0 %  3.8 %  4.0 %  4.0 %  4.0 %                    Weighted-average assumptions used to determine net cost:                   Discount rate used to measure service cost  4.2 %  4.5 %  3.8 %  2.4 %  2.9 %  3.3 %  3.9 %  4.2 %  3.9 % Discount rate used to measure interest cost  3.3 %  3.4 %  3.8 %  2.3 %  2.8 %  3.3 %  3.3 %  3.3 %  3.9 % Expected rate of return on plan assets  6.7 %  6.9 %  7.4 %  5.9 %  6.1 %  6.8 %  7.5 %  7.5 %  7.8 % Rate of compensation increase  4.0 %  4.0 %  4.0 %  4.0 %  3.6 %  4.0 %  4.0 %  4.0 %  4.0 %                    Health care cost trend rates at year-end:                   Health care trend rate assumed for next year  6.1 %  6.6 %  6.5 % Rate that the cost trend rate gradually declines to  5.0 %  5.0 %  5.0 % Year that the cost trend rate reaches ultimate rate                       ##TABLE_ENDSENSITIVITY  Foreign Exchange Rate Sensitivity  Machinery, Energy  Transportation operations use foreign currency forward and option contracts to manage unmatched foreign currency cash inflow and outflow. Our objective is to minimize the risk of exchange rate movements that would reduce the U.S. dollar value of our foreign currency cash flow. Our policy allows for managing anticipated foreign currency cash flow for up to five years. Based on the anticipated and firmly committed cash inflow and outflow for our Machinery, Energy  Transportation operations for the next 12 months and the foreign currency derivative instruments in place at year-end, a hypothetical 10 percent weakening of the U.S. dollar relative to all other currencies would adversely affect our expected 2018 cash flow for our Machinery, Energy  Transportation operations by approximately $193 million. Last year similar assumptions and calculations yielded a potential $143 million adverse impact on 2017 cash flow. We determine our net exposures by calculating the difference in cash inflow and outflow by currency and adding or subtracting outstanding foreign currency derivative instruments. We multiply these net amounts by 10 percent to determine the sensitivity.  Since our policy for Financial Products operations is to hedge the foreign exchange risk when the currency of our debt portfolio does not match the currency of our receivable portfolio, a 10 percent change in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to all other currencies would not have a material effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flow. Neither our policy nor the effect of a 10 percent change in the value of the U.S. dollar has changed from that reported at the end of last year. The effect of the hypothetical change in exchange rates ignores the effect this movement may have on other variables, including competitive risk. If it were possible to quantify this competitive impact, the results would probably be different from the sensitivity effects shown above. In addition, it is unlikely that all currencies would uniformly strengthen or weaken relative to the U.S. dollar. In reality, some currencies may weaken while others may strengthen. Our primary exposure (excluding competitive risk) is to exchange rate movements in the Japanese yen, British pound, Indian rupee, euro and Australian dollar.  Interest Rate Sensitivity  For our Machinery, Energy  Transportation operations, we have the option to use interest rate swaps to lower the cost of borrowed funds by attaching fixed-to-floating interest rate swaps to fixed-rate debt, and by entering into forward rate agreements on future debt issuances. A hypothetical 100 basis point adverse move in interest rates along the entire interest rate yield curve would have a minimal impact to the 2018 pre-tax earnings of Machinery, Energy  Transportation. Last year, similar assumptions and calculations yielded a minimal impact to 2017 pre-tax earnings.  For our Financial Products operations, we use interest rate derivative instruments primarily to meet our match-funding objectives and strategies. We have a match-funding policy whereby the interest rate profile (fixed or floating rate) of our debt portfolio is matched to the interest rate profile of our earning asset portfolio (finance receivables and operating leases) within certain parameters. In connection with that policy, we use interest rate swap agreements to modify the debt structure. Match funding assists us in maintaining our interest rate spreads, regardless of the direction interest rates move.  In order to properly manage sensitivity to changes in interest rates, Financial Products measures the potential impact of different interest rate assumptions on pre-tax earnings. All on-balance sheet positions, including derivative financial instruments, are included in the analysis. The primary assumptions included in the analysis are that there are no new fixed rate assets or liabilities, the proportion of fixed rate debt to fixed rate assets remains unchanged and the level of floating rate assets and debt remain constant. An analysis of the December 31, 2017 balance sheet, using these assumptions, estimates the impact of a 100 basis point immediate and sustained adverse change in interest rates to have a potential $5 million adverse impact on 2018 pre-tax earnings. Last year, similar assumptions and calculations yielded a potential $6 million adverse impact to 2017 pre-tax earnings.  This analysis does not necessarily represent our current outlook of future market interest rate movement, nor does it consider any actions management could undertake in response to changes in interest rates. Accordingly, no assurance can be given that actual results would be consistent with the results of our estimate. NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES The following definitions are provided for the non-GAAP financial measures used in this report. These non-GAAP financial measures have no standardized meaning prescribed by U.S. GAAP and therefore are unlikely to be comparable to the calculation of similar measures for other companies. Management does not intend these items to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the related GAAP measures. We believe it is important to separately quantify the profit impact of several significant items in order for our results to be meaningful to our readers. These items consist of (i) restructuring costs, which are incurred in the current year to generate longer term benefits, (ii) pension and OPEB mark-to-market losses resulting from plan remeasurements, (iii) state deferred tax valuation allowance (reversal), (iv) a gain on the sale of an equity investment, (v) U.S. tax reform impact and (vi) goodwill impairment charges. We do not consider these items indicative of earnings from ongoing business activities and believe the non-GAAP measures will provide useful perspective on underlying business results and trends, and a means to assess our period-over-period results.

The data has been grouped as follows:  Consolidated  Caterpillar Inc. and its subsidiaries.  Machinery, Energy  Transportation  Caterpillar defines Machinery, Energy  Transportation as it is presented in the supplemental data as Caterpillar Inc. and its subsidiaries with Financial Products accounted for on the equity basis. Machinery, Energy  Transportation information relates to the design, manufacturing and marketing of our products. Financial Products' information relates to the financing to customers and dealers for the purchase and lease of Caterpillar and other equipment. The nature of these businesses is different, especially with regard to the financial position and cash flow items. Caterpillar management utilizes this presentation internally to highlight these differences. We also believe this presentation will assist readers in understanding our business.  Financial Products  Our finance and insurance subsidiaries, primarily Cat Financial and Insurance Services.  Consolidating Adjustments  Eliminations of transactions between Machinery, Energy  Transportation and Financial Products. Pages 68 to 70 reconcile Machinery, Energy  Transportation with Financial Products on the equity basis to Caterpillar Inc. consolidated financial information. ##TABLE_START Supplemental Data for Results of Operations For The Years Ended December 31      Supplemental consolidating data    Consolidated  Machinery, Energy  Transportation 1  Financial Products  Consolidating Adjustments  (Millions of dollars)              Sales and revenues:                          Sales of Machinery, Energy  Transportation  $ 42,676  $ 35,773  $ 44,147  $ 42,676  $ 35,773  $ 44,147  $   $   $   $   $   $   Revenues of Financial Products  2,786  2,764  2,864        3,167  3,065  3,179  (381 ) 2  (301 ) 2  (315 ) 2  Total sales and revenues  45,462  38,537  47,011  42,676  35,773  44,147  3,167  3,065  3,179  (381 )  (301 )  (315 )                            Operating costs:                          Cost of goods sold  31,049  28,309  33,546  31,050  28,311  33,548        (1 ) 3  (2 ) 3  (2 ) 3  Selling, general and administrative expenses  5,177  4,686  4,951  4,589  4,129  4,389     (16 ) 3  (16 ) 3  (26 ) 3  Research and development expenses  1,905  1,951  2,119  1,905  1,951  2,119              Interest expense of Financial Products              (21 ) 4  (15 ) 4  (6 ) 4  Goodwill impairment charge                        Other operating (income) expenses  2,279  1,902  2,023  1,080    1,220  1,232  1,224  (21 ) 3  (28 ) 3  (22 ) 3  Total operating costs  41,056  38,039  43,226  38,624  35,684  40,877  2,491  2,416  2,405  (59 )  (61 )  (56 )  Operating profit  4,406   3,785  4,052   3,270     (322 )  (240 )  (259 )  Interest expense excluding Financial Products              (91 ) 4  (48 ) 4  (43 ) 4  Other income (expense)     (116 )  (89 )  (103 )     5  5  5                         Consolidated profit (loss) before taxes  4,082   3,439  3,314  (553 )  2,617           Provision (benefit) for income taxes  3,339    3,317  (24 )            Profit (loss) of consolidated companies   (53 )  2,523  (3 )  (529 )  1,931           Equity in profit (loss) of unconsolidated affiliated companies   (6 )     (6 )                Equity in profit of Financial Products subsidiaries                 (738 ) 6  (470 ) 6  (591 ) 6                            Profit (loss) of consolidated and affiliated companies   (59 )  2,523   (65 )  2,522     (738 )  (470 )  (591 )                            Less: Profit (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests     (3 )                                       Profit (loss)  7   $  $ (67 )  $ 2,512  $  $ (67 )  $ 2,512  $  $  $  $ (738 )  $ (470 )  $ (591 )  ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START 1  Represents Caterpillar Inc. and its subsidiaries with Financial Products accounted for on the equity basis. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START 2  Elimination of Financial Products revenues earned from Machinery, Energy  Transportation. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START 3  Elimination of net expenses recorded by Machinery, Energy  Transportation paid to Financial Products. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START 4  Elimination of interest expense recorded between Financial Products and Machinery, Energy  Transportation. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START 5  Elimination of discount recorded by Machinery, Energy  Transportation on receivables sold to Financial Products and of interest earned between Machinery, Energy  Transportation and Financial Products. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START 6  Elimination of Financial Products profit due to equity method of accounting. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START 7  Profit (loss) attributable to common shareholders. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START      ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START Supplemental Data for Financial Position                  At December 31      Supplemental consolidating data    Consolidated  Machinery, Energy  Transportation 1  Financial Products  Consolidating Adjustments  (Millions of dollars)          Assets                  Current assets:                  Cash and short-term investments  $ 8,261  $ 7,168  $ 7,381  $ 5,257  $  $ 1,911  $   $   Receivables -

(company) is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act. Our internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of our financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Our internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.  Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.  Management assessed the effectiveness of the companys internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2017 . In making this assessment, we used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework (2013). Based on our assessment we concluded that, as of December 31, 2017 , the companys internal control over financial reporting was effective based on those criteria.  The effectiveness of the companys internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2017 has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm. Their report appears on pages 73-74.   ##TABLE_START  /s/ D. James Umpleby III   D. James Umpleby III   Chief Executive Officer           /s/ Bradley M. Halverson   Bradley M. Halverson   Group President   and Chief Financial Officer         February 15, 2018  ##TABLE_ENDREPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of Caterpillar Inc.: Opinions on the Financial Statements and Internal Control over Financial Reporting We have audited the accompanying consolidated statement of financial position of Caterpillar Inc. and its subsidiaries as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, and the related consolidated statements of results of operations, comprehensive income (loss), changes in shareholders equity and cash flow for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2017 including the related notes (collectively referred to as the consolidated financial statements). We also have audited the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2017, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2017 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2017, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the COSO. Basis for Opinions The Company's management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management's Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express opinions on the Companys consolidated financial statements and on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (\"PCAOB\") and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions. Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting A companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. /s/ PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP Peoria, Illinois February 15, 2018 We have served as the Companys auditor since 1925.  ##TABLE_START STATEMENT 1 Caterpillar Inc.

Operations and summary of significant accounting policies ##TABLE_END  ##TABLE_START A. Nature of operations ##TABLE_END  Information in our financial statements and related commentary are presented in the following categories:  Machinery, Energy  Transportation (MET)  Represents the aggregate total of Construction Industries, Resource Industries, Energy  Transportation and All Other operating segments and related corporate items and eliminations.  Financial Products  Primarily includes the companys Financial Products Segment. This category includes Caterpillar Financial Services Corporation (Cat Financial), Caterpillar Insurance Holdings Inc. (Insurance Services) and their respective subsidiaries.  Our products are sold primarily under the brands Caterpillar, CAT, design versions of CAT and Caterpillar, \"EMD,\" FG Wilson, MaK, MWM, Perkins, Progress Rail, SEM and Solar Turbines.  We conduct operations in our Machinery, Energy  Transportation lines of business under highly competitive conditions, including intense price competition. We place great emphasis on the high quality and performance of our products and our dealers service support. Although no one competitor is believed to produce all of the same types of equipment that we do, there are numerous companies, large and small, which compete with us in the sale of each of our products.  Our machines are distributed principally through a worldwide organization of dealers (dealer network), 48 located in the United States and 123 located outside the United States, serving 192 countries. Reciprocating engines are sold principally through the dealer network and to other manufacturers for use in products. Some of the reciprocating engines manufactured by our subsidiary Perkins Engines Company Limited, are also sold through its worldwide network of 93 distributors covering 182 countries. The FG Wilson branded electric power generation systems primarily manufactured by our subsidiary Caterpillar Northern Ireland Limited are sold through its worldwide network of 154 distributors covering 131 countries. Some of the large, medium speed reciprocating engines are also sold under the MaK brand through a worldwide network of 20 distributors covering 130 countries. Our dealers do not deal exclusively with our products; however, in most cases sales and servicing of our products are the dealers principal business. Some products, primarily turbines and locomotives, are sold directly to end customers through sales forces employed by the company. At times, these employees are assisted by independent sales representatives.  The Financial Products line of business also conducts operations under highly competitive conditions. Financing for users of Caterpillar products is available through a variety of competitive sources, principally commercial banks and finance and leasing companies. We offer various financing plans designed to increase the opportunity for sales of our products and generate financing income for our company. A significant portion of Financial Products activity is conducted in North America, with additional offices in Latin America, Asia/Pacific, Europe, Africa and Middle East. ##TABLE_START B. Basis of presentation ##TABLE_END  The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Caterpillar Inc. and its subsidiaries where we have a controlling financial interest. Investments in companies where our ownership exceeds 20 percent and we do not have a controlling interest or where the ownership is less than 20 percent and for which we have a significant influence are accounted for by the equity method. See Note 9 for further discussion. We consolidate all variable interest entities (VIEs) where Caterpillar Inc. is the primary beneficiary. For VIEs, we assess whether we are the primary beneficiary as prescribed by the accounting guidance on the consolidation of VIEs. The primary beneficiary of a VIE is the party that has both the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the entitys economic performance and the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits that could potentially be significant to the VIE. See Note 21 for further discussion on a consolidated VIE. We have affiliates, suppliers and dealers that are VIEs of which we are not the primary beneficiary. Although we have provided financial support, we do not have the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the economic performance of each entity. Our maximum exposure to loss from VIEs for which we are not the primary beneficiary was as follows: ##TABLE_START   December 31, (Millions of dollars)    Receivables - trade and other  $  $  Receivables - finance    Long-term receivables - finance    Investments in unconsolidated affiliated companies    Guarantees    Total  $  $        ##TABLE_ENDIn addition, Cat Financial has end-user customers that are VIEs of which we are not the primary beneficiary. Although we have provided financial support to these entities and therefore have a variable interest, we do not have the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact their economic performance. Our maximum exposure to loss from our involvement with these VIEs is limited to the credit risk inherently present in the financial support that we have provided. These risks are evaluated and reflected in our financial statements as part of our overall portfolio of finance receivables and related allowance for credit losses. Shipping and handling costs are included in Cost of goods sold in Statement 1. Other operating (income) expenses primarily include Cat Financials depreciation of equipment leased to others, Insurance Services underwriting expenses, (gains) losses on disposal of long-lived assets, long-lived asset impairment charges, contract termination costs, legal settlements and accruals, employee separation charges and benefit plan curtailment (gains) losses.  Prepaid expenses and other current assets in Statement 3 include prepaid rent, prepaid insurance, prepaid and refundable income tax, assets held for sale, core to be returned for remanufacturing, restricted cash and other short-term investments and other prepaid items. Certain amounts for prior years have been reclassified to conform with the current-year financial statement presentation. ##TABLE_START C. Sales and revenue recognition ##TABLE_END  Sales of Machinery, Energy  Transportation are recognized and earned when all the following criteria are satisfied: (a) persuasive evidence of a sales arrangement exists; (b) price is fixed and determinable; (c) collectibility is reasonably assured; and (d) delivery has occurred. Persuasive evidence of an arrangement and a fixed or determinable price exist once we receive an order or contract from an end user or independently owned and operated dealer. We assess collectibility at the time of the sale and if collectibility is not reasonably assured, the sale is deferred and not recognized until collectibility is probable or payment is received. Typically, where product is produced and sold in the same country, title and risk of ownership transfer when the product is shipped. Products that are exported from a country for sale typically pass title and risk of ownership at the border of the destination country.  Sales of certain turbine machinery units, draglines and long wall roof supports are recognized under accounting for construction-type contracts, primarily using the percentage-of-completion method. Revenue is recognized based upon progress towards completion, which is estimated and continually updated over the course of construction. We provide for any loss that we expect to incur on these contracts when that loss is probable.  Our remanufacturing operations are primarily focused on the remanufacture of Cat engines and components and rail related products. In this business, used engines and related components (core) are inspected, cleaned and remanufactured. In connection with the sale of most of our remanufactured product, we collect a deposit from the dealer that is repaid if the dealer returns an acceptable core within a specified time period. Caterpillar owns and has title to the cores when they are returned from dealers and end users. The rebuilt engine or component (the core plus any new content) is then sold as a remanufactured product to dealers and end users. Revenue is recognized pursuant to the same criteria as Machinery, Energy  Transportation sales noted above (title to the entire remanufactured product passes to the dealer upon sale). At the time of sale, the deposit is recognized in Other current liabilities in Statement 3. In addition, the core to be returned is recognized as an asset in Prepaid expenses and other current assets in Statement 3 at the estimated replacement cost (based on historical experience with useable cores). Upon receipt of an acceptable core, we repay the deposit and relieve the liability. The returned core is then included in inventory. In the event that the deposit is forfeited (i.e. upon failure by the dealer to return an acceptable core in the specified time period), we recognize the core deposit and the cost of the core in Sales and Cost of goods sold, respectively.  Except for replacement parts, no right of return exists on the sale of our products. Replacement part returns are estimable and accrued at the time a sale is recognized.  We provide discounts to dealers through merchandising programs. We have numerous programs that are designed to promote the sale of our products. The most common dealer programs provide a discount when the dealer sells a product to a targeted end user. The cost of these discounts is estimated based on historical experience and known changes in merchandising programs and is reported as a reduction to sales when the product sale is recognized. A corresponding post-sale discount reserve is accrued in Statement 3, which represents discounts we expect to pay on previously sold products.  Our standard dealer invoice terms are established by marketing region. Our invoice terms for end user sales are established by the responsible business unit. When a sale is made to a dealer, the dealer is responsible for payment even if the product is not sold to an end user. Dealers and end users must make payment within the established invoice terms to avoid potential interest costs. Interest at or above prevailing market rates may be charged on any past due balance, and generally our practice is to not forgive this interest. In 2017 , 2016 and 2015 terms were extended to not more than one year for $267 million , $406 million and $635 million of receivables, respectively, which represent approximately 1 percent of consolidated sales. We establish a bad debt allowance for Machinery, Energy  Transportation receivables when it becomes probable that the receivable will not be collected. Our allowance for bad debts is not significant. Revenues of Financial Products are generated primarily from finance revenue on finance receivables and rental payments on operating leases. Finance revenue is recorded over the life of the related finance receivable using the interest method, including the accretion of certain direct origination costs that are deferred. Revenue from rental payments received on operating leases is recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease. Recognition of finance revenue and rental revenue is suspended and the account is placed on non-accrual status when management determines that collection of future income is not probable (generally after 120 days past due). Recognition is resumed, and previously suspended income is recognized, when the account becomes current and collection of remaining amounts is considered probable. See Note 6 for more information.  Sales and revenues are presented net of sales and other related taxes.  ##TABLE_START D. Inventories ##TABLE_END  Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Cost is principally determined using the last-in, first-out (LIFO) method. The value of inventories on the LIFO basis represented about 65 percent and 60 percent of total inventories at December 31, 2017 and 2016 .  If the FIFO (first-in, first-out) method had been in use, inventories would have been $1,934 million and $2,139 million higher than reported at December 31, 2017 and 2016 , respectively. ##TABLE_START E. Depreciation and amortization ##TABLE_END  Depreciation of plant and equipment is computed principally using accelerated methods. Depreciation on equipment leased to others, primarily for Financial Products, is computed using the straight-line method over the term of the lease. The depreciable basis is the original cost of the equipment less the estimated residual value of the equipment at the end of the lease term. In 2017 , 2016 and 2015 , Cat Financial depreciation on equipment leased to others was $810 million , $841 million and $836 million , respectively, and was included in Other operating (income) expenses in Statement 1. In 2017 , 2016 and 2015 , consolidated depreciation expense was $2,555 million , $2,707 million and $2,705 million , respectively. Amortization of purchased finite-lived intangibles is computed principally using the straight-line method, generally not to exceed a period of 20 years .  ##TABLE_START F. Foreign currency translation ##TABLE_END  The functional currency for most of our Machinery, Energy  Transportation consolidated companies is the U.S. dollar. The functional currency for most of our Financial Products and affiliates accounted for under the equity method is the respective local currency. Gains and losses resulting from the remeasurement of foreign currency amounts to the functional currency are included in Other income (expense) in Statement 1. Gains and losses resulting from translating assets and liabilities from the functional currency to U.S. dollars are included in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in Statement 3.  ##TABLE_START G. Derivative financial instruments ##TABLE_END  Our earnings and cash flow are subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates and commodity prices. Our Risk Management Policy (policy) allows for the use of derivative financial instruments to prudently manage foreign currency exchange rate, interest rate and commodity price exposures. Our policy specifies that derivatives are not to be used for speculative purposes. Derivatives that we use are primarily foreign currency forward, option, and cross currency contracts, interest rate swaps, and commodity forward and option contracts. All derivatives are recorded at fair value. See Note 3 for more information. ##TABLE_START H. Income taxes ##TABLE_END  The provision for income taxes is determined using the asset and liability approach taking into account guidance related to uncertain tax positions. Tax laws require items to be included in tax filings at different times than the items are reflected in the financial statements. A current liability is recognized for the estimated taxes payable for the current year. Deferred taxes represent the future tax consequences expected to occur when the reported amounts of assets and liabilities are recovered or paid. Deferred taxes are adjusted for enacted changes in tax rates and tax laws. Valuation allowances are recorded to reduce deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will not be realized. ##TABLE_START I. Goodwill ##TABLE_END  For acquisitions accounted for as a business combination, goodwill represents the excess of the cost over the fair value of the net assets acquired. We are required to test goodwill for impairment, at the reporting unit level, annually and when events or circumstances make it more likely than not that an impairment may have occurred. A reporting unit is an operating segment or one level below an operating segment (referred to as a component) to which goodwill is assigned when initially recorded. We assign goodwill to reporting units based on our integration plans and the expected synergies resulting from the acquisition. Because Caterpillar is a highly integrated company, the businesses we acquire are sometimes combined with or integrated into existing reporting units. When changes occur in the composition of our operating segments or reporting units, goodwill is reassigned to the affected reporting units based on their relative fair values. We perform our annual goodwill impairment test as of October 1 and monitor for interim triggering events on an ongoing basis. Goodwill is reviewed for impairment utilizing either a qualitative assessment or a quantitative goodwill impairment test. If we choose to perform a qualitative assessment and determine the fair value more likely than not exceeds the carrying value, no further evaluation is necessary. For reporting units where we perform the quantitative goodwill impairment test, we compare the fair value of each reporting unit, which we primarily determine using an income approach based on the present value of discounted cash flows, to the respective carrying value, which includes goodwill. If the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying value, the goodwill is not considered impaired. Beginning in 2017, if the carrying value is higher than the fair value, the difference would be recognized as an impairment loss. Prior to 2017, a two-step process was used. For reporting units where we performed the two-step process, the first step required us to compare the fair value of each reporting unit, which we primarily determined using an income approach based on the present value of discounted cash flows, to the respective carrying value, which includes goodwill. If the fair value of the reporting unit exceeded its carrying value, the goodwill was not considered impaired. If the carrying value was higher than the fair value, there was an indication that an impairment may have existed and the second step was required. In step two, the implied fair value of goodwill was calculated as the excess of the fair value of a reporting unit over the fair values assigned to its assets and liabilities. If the implied fair value of goodwill was less than the carrying value of the reporting units goodwill, the difference was recognized as an impairment loss. See Note 10 for further details. ##TABLE_START J. Estimates in financial statements ##TABLE_END  The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts. The more significant estimates include: residual values for leased assets, fair values for goodwill impairment tests, impairment of available-for-sale securities, warranty liability, stock-based compensation and reserves for product liability and insurance losses, postretirement benefits, post-sale discounts, credit losses and income taxes. ##TABLE_START K. New accounting guidance ##TABLE_END  Revenue recognition - In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued new revenue recognition guidance to provide a single, comprehensive revenue recognition model for all contracts with customers. Under the new guidance, an entity will recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers at an amount that the entity expects to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services. A five step model has been introduced for an entity to apply when recognizing revenue. The new guidance also includes enhanced disclosure requirements, and was effective January 1, 2018. Entities have the option to apply the new guidance under a retrospective approach to each prior reporting period presented, or a modified retrospective approach with the cumulative effect of initially applying the new guidance recognized at the date of initial application within the Consolidated Statement of Changes in Shareholders' Equity. We will adopt the new guidance effective January 1, 2018 under the modified retrospective approach. Under the new guidance, sales of certain turbine machinery units will change to a point-in-time recognition model. Under current guidance, we account for these sales under an over-time model following the percentage-of-completion method as the product is manufactured. In addition, under the new guidance we will begin to recognize an asset for the value of expected replacement part returns and will discontinue lease accounting treatment for certain product sales containing residual value guarantees. We do not expect the adoption to have a material impact on our financial statements. Simplifying the measurement of inventory - In July 2015, the FASB issued accounting guidance which requires that inventory be measured at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Prior to the issuance of the new guidance, inventory was measured at the lower of cost or market. Replacing the concept of market with the single measurement of net realizable value is intended to create efficiencies for preparers. Inventory measured using the last-in, first-out (LIFO) method and the retail inventory method are not impacted by the new guidance. The guidance was effective January 1, 2017, and was applied prospectively. The adoption did not have a material impact on our financial statements. Recognition and measurement of financial assets and financial liabilities - In January 2016, the FASB issued accounting guidance that affects the accounting for equity investments, financial liabilities accounted for under the fair value option and the presentation and disclosure requirements for financial instruments. Under the new guidance, all equity investments in unconsolidated entities (other than those accounted for using the equity method of accounting) will generally be measured at fair value through earnings. There will no longer be an available-for-sale classification for equity securities with readily determinable fair values. For financial liabilities when the fair value option has been elected, changes in fair value due to instrument-specific credit risk will be recognized separately in other comprehensive income. In addition, the FASB clarified guidance related to the valuation allowance assessment when recognizing deferred tax assets resulting from unrealized losses on available-for-sale debt securities. The guidance was effective January 1, 2018, and will be applied on a modified retrospective basis through a cumulative effect adjustment to retained earnings as of January 1, 2018. We do not expect the adoption to have a material impact on our financial statements. Lease accounting - In February 2016, the FASB issued accounting guidance that revises the accounting for leases. Under the new guidance, lessees are required to recognize a right-of-use asset and a lease liability for all leases. The new guidance will continue to classify leases as either financing or operating, with classification affecting the pattern of expense recognition. The accounting applied by a lessor under the new guidance will be substantially equivalent to current lease accounting guidance. The new guidance is effective January 1, 2019, with early adoption permitted. The new standard is required to be applied with a modified retrospective approach to each prior reporting period presented and provides for certain practical expedients. An implementation team is in the process of evaluating the effect of the new guidance on our financial statements. We plan to adopt the new guidance effective January 1, 2019. Stock-based compensation  - In March 2016, the FASB issued accounting guidance to simplify several aspects of the accounting for share-based payments. The new guidance changes how reporting entities account for certain aspects of share-based payments, including the accounting for income taxes and the classification of the tax impact on the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flow. Under the new guidance all excess tax benefits and deficiencies during the period are recognized in income (rather than equity) on a prospective basis. The guidance removes the requirement to delay recognition of excess tax benefits until it reduces income taxes currently payable. This change was required to be applied on a modified retrospective basis, resulting in a cumulative-effect adjustment to opening retained earnings in the period of adoption. In addition, Cash flows related to excess tax benefits are now included in Cash provided by operating activities and will no longer be separately classified as a financing activity. This change was adopted retrospectively. The guidance was effective January 1, 2017, and did not have a material impact on our financial statements. Measurement of credit losses on financial instruments  - In June 2016, the FASB issued accounting guidance to introduce a new model for recognizing credit losses on financial instruments based on an estimate of current expected credit losses. The new guidance will apply to loans, accounts receivable, trade receivables, other financial assets measured at amortized cost, loan commitments and other off-balance sheet credit exposures. The new guidance will also apply to debt securities and other financial assets measured at fair value through other comprehensive income. The new guidance is effective January 1, 2020, with early adoption permitted beginning January 1, 2019. We are in the process of evaluating the effect of the new guidance on our financial statements. Classification for certain cash receipts and cash payments  - In August 2016, the FASB issued accounting guidance related to the presentation and classification of certain transactions in the statement of cash flows where diversity in practice exists. The guidance was effective January 1, 2018, and we do not expect the adoption to have a material impact on our financial statements. Tax accounting for intra-entity asset transfers  - In October 2016, the FASB issued accounting guidance that requires the tax effects of intra-entity asset transfers to be recognized in the period when the transfer occurs. Under previous guidance, the tax effects of intra-entity sales of assets were deferred until the transferred asset was sold to a third party or otherwise recovered through use. The new guidance does not apply to intra-entity transfers of inventory. The guidance was effective January 1, 2018, and will be applied on a modified retrospective basis through a cumulative effect adjustment to retained earnings as of January 1, 2018. We do not expect the adoption to have a material impact on our financial statements. Classification of restricted cash  - In November 2016, the FASB issued accounting guidance related to the presentation and classification of changes in restricted cash on the statement of cash flows where diversity in practice exists. The new standard is required to be applied with a retrospective approach. The guidance was effective January 1, 2018, and we do not expect the adoption to have a material impact on our financial statements. Clarification on the definition of a business  - In January 2017, the FASB issued accounting guidance to clarify the definition of a business with the objective of adding guidance to assist entities with evaluating whether transactions should be accounted for as acquisitions (or disposals) of assets or businesses. The guidance was effective January 1, 2018, with early adoption permitted. We adopted the guidance effective January 1, 2017, and the adoption did not have a material impact on our financial statements. Simplifying the measurement for goodwill - In January 2017, the FASB issued guidance to simplify the accounting for goodwill impairment. The guidance removes Step 2 of the goodwill impairment test, which requires a hypothetical purchase price allocation. A goodwill impairment will now be the amount by which a reporting units carrying value exceeds its fair value, not to exceed the carrying amount of goodwill. The new guidance will be applied prospectively and is effective January 1, 2020, with early adoption permitted beginning January 1, 2017. We adopted the guidance effective January 1, 2017. The adoption did not have a material impact on our financial statements. Presentation of net periodic pension costs and net periodic postretirement benefit costs - In March 2017, the FASB issued accounting guidance that will require that an employer disaggregate the service cost component from the other components of net benefit cost. Service cost is required to be reported in the same line item or items as other compensation costs arising from services rendered by the pertinent employees during the period. The other components of net periodic benefit cost are required to be reported outside the subtotal for income from operations. Additionally, only the service cost component of net benefit costs are eligible for capitalization. The guidance was effective January 1, 2018, and we will apply the presentation changes retrospectively and the capitalization change prospectively. The adoption primarily results in the reclassification of other components of net periodic benefit cost outside of Operating profit in the Consolidated Statement of Results of Operations. Premium amortization on purchased callable debt securities - In March 2017, the FASB issued accounting guidance related to the amortization period for certain purchased callable debt securities held at a premium. Securities held at a premium will be required to be amortized to the earliest call date rather than the maturity date. The new standard is required to be applied with a modified retrospective approach through a cumulative-effect adjustment directly to retained earnings as of the beginning of the period of adoption. The guidance is effective January 1, 2019, with early adoption permitted. We do not expect the adoption to have a material impact on our financial statements. Clarification on stock-based compensation  - In May 2017, the FASB issued accounting guidance to clarify which changes to the terms or conditions of a share-based payment award require an entity to apply modification accounting. The new standard is required to be applied prospectively. The guidance was effective January 1, 2018, and we do not expect the adoption to have a material impact on our financial statements. Derivatives and hedging  - In August 2017, the FASB issued accounting guidance to better align hedge accounting with a companys risk management activities, simplify the application of hedge accounting and improve the disclosures of hedging arrangements. The new guidance is required to be applied on a modified retrospective basis, resulting in a cumulative-effect adjustment to opening retained earnings in the period of adoption. The guidance is effective January 1, 2019, with early adoption permitted. The impact on our financial statements at the time of adoption will primarily be reclassification of our gains (losses) for designated MET foreign exchange contracts from Other income (expense) to other components of Operating profit in the Consolidated Statement of Results of Operations. ##TABLE_START 2. Stock-based compensation ##TABLE_END  Our stock-based compensation plans primarily provide for the granting of stock options, stock-settled stock appreciation rights (SARs), restricted stock units (RSUs) and performance-based restricted stock units (PRSUs) to Officers and other key employees, as well as non-employee Directors. Stock options permit a holder to buy Caterpillar stock at the stocks price when the option was granted. SARs permit a holder the right to receive the value in shares of the appreciation in Caterpillar stock that occurred from the date the right was granted up to the date of exercise. RSUs are agreements to issue shares of Caterpillar stock at the time of vesting. PRSUs are similar to RSUs and include performance conditions in the vesting terms of the award.  Our long-standing practices and policies specify that all stock-based compensation awards are approved by the Compensation Committee (the Committee) of the Board of Directors. The award approval process specifies the grant date, value and terms of the award. The same terms and conditions are consistently applied to all employee grants, including Officers. The Committee approves all individual Officer grants. The number of stock-based compensation award units included in an individuals award is determined based on the methodology approved by the Committee. The exercise price methodology approved by the Committee is the closing price of the Company stock on the date of the grant. In June of 2014, shareholders approved the Caterpillar Inc. 2014 Long-Term Incentive Plan (the Plan) under which all new stock-based compensation awards are granted. In June of 2017, the Plan was amended and restated. The Plan initially provided that up to 38,800,000 Common Shares would be reserved for future issuance under the Plan, subject to adjustment in certain events. Upon shareholder approval of the amendment and restatement of the Plan, an additional 36,000,000 Common Shares became available for all awards under the Plan.  Common stock issued from Treasury stock under the plans totaled 11,139,748 for 2017 , 4,164,134 for 2016 and 2,931,595 for 2015 . The total number of shares authorized for equity awards under the amended and restated Caterpillar Inc. 2014 Long-Term Incentive Plan is 74,800,000 , of which 47,352,427 shares remained available for issuance as of December 31, 2017.  Stock option and RSU awards generally vest according to a three -year graded vesting schedule. One-third of the award will become vested on the first anniversary of the grant date, one-third of the award will become vested on the second anniversary of the grant date and one-third of the award will become vested on the third anniversary of the grant date. PRSU awards generally have a three -year performance period and cliff vest at the end of the period based upon achievement of performance targets established at the time of grant. Upon separation from service, if the participant is 55 years of age or older with more than five years of service, the participant meets the criteria for a \"Long Service Separation.\" Award terms for awards granted in 2016 and 2015 allow for immediate vesting upon separation of all outstanding options and RSUs with no requisite service period for employees who meet the criteria for a \"Long Service Separation.\" Compensation expense for the 2016 and 2015 grants was fully recognized immediately on the grant date for these employees. Award terms for the 2017 grant allow for continued vesting as of each vesting date specified in the award document for employees who meet the criteria for a \"Long Service Separation\" and fulfill a requisite service period of six months. Compensation expense for eligible employees for the 2017 grant was recognized over the period from the grant date to the end date of the six-month requisite service period. For employees who become eligible for a \"Long Service Separation\" subsequent to the end date of the six-month requisite service period and prior to the completion of the vesting period, compensation expense is recognized over the period from the grant date to the date eligibility is achieved. At grant, SARs and option awards have a term life of ten years . For awards granted prior to 2016, if the Long Service Separation criteria are met, the vested options/SARs have a life that is the lesser of ten years from the original grant date or five years from the separation date. For awards granted in 2017 and 2016, the vested options/SARs have a life equal to ten years from the original grant date. Prior to 2017, all outstanding PRSU awards granted to employees eligible for a \"Long Service Separation\" may vest at the end of the performance period based upon achievement of the performance target. Compensation expense for the 2016 and 2015 PRSU grants was fully recognized immediately on the grant date for these employees. For PRSU awards granted in 2017, only a prorated number of shares may vest at the end of the performance period based upon achievement of the performance target, with the proration based upon the number of months of continuous employment during the three-year performance period. Employees with a \"Long Service Separation\" must also fulfill a six-month requisite service period in order to be eligible for the prorated vesting of outstanding PRSU awards granted in 2017. Compensation expense for the 2017 PRSU grant is being recognized on a straight-line basis over the three-year performance period for all participants.  Accounting guidance on share-based payments requires companies to estimate the fair value of options/SARs on the date of grant using an option-pricing model. The fair value of our option/SAR grants was estimated using a lattice-based option-pricing model. The lattice-based option-pricing model considers a range of assumptions related to volatility, risk-free interest rate and historical employee behavior. Expected volatility was based on historical Caterpillar stock price movement and current implied volatilities from traded options on Caterpillar stock. The risk-free interest rate was based on U.S. Treasury security yields at the time of grant. The weighted-average dividend yield was based on historical information. The expected life was determined from the lattice-based model. The lattice-based model incorporated exercise and post vesting forfeiture assumptions based on analysis of historical data. The following table provides the assumptions used in determining the fair value of the Option/SAR awards for the years ended December 31, 2017 , 2016 and 2015 , respectively. ##TABLE_START  Grant Year    Weighted-average dividend yield 3.4 %  3.2 %  2.3 % Weighted-average volatility 29.2 %  31.1 %  28.4 % Range of volatilities 22.1-33.0%  22.5-33.4%  19.9-35.9% Range of risk-free interest rates 0.81-2.35%  0.62-1.73%  0.22-2.08% Weighted-average expected lives 8 years  8 years  8 years       ##TABLE_END The fair value of RSU and PRSU grants was estimated by reducing the stock price on the date of grant by the present value of the estimated dividends to be paid during the vesting period. The estimated dividends are based on Caterpillars quarterly dividend per share at the time of the grant.  Please refer to Tables I and II below for additional information on our stock-based compensation awards. ##TABLE_START TABLE I  Financial Information Related to Stock-based Compensation        Stock options / SARs  RSUs  PRSUs  Shares  Weighted- Average Exercise Price  Shares  Weighted- Average Grant Date Fair Value  Shares  Weighted- Average Grant Date Fair Value             Outstanding at January 1, 2017 32,064,790  $ 82.13  3,071,014  $ 78.50  710,286  $ 66.92 Granted to officers and key employees 1 2,701,644  $ 95.66  924,421  $ 90.11  437,385  $ 86.78 Exercised (12,997,205 )  $ 76.89    $     $  Vested   $   (1,982,565 )  $ 82.37  (129,000 )  $ 77.47 Forfeited / expired (269,334 )  $ 94.23  (48,353 )  $ 79.43  (11,680 )  $ 78.14 Outstanding at December 31, 2017 21,499,895  $ 86.86  1,964,517  $ 80.04  1,006,991  $ 74.06 Exercisable at December 31, 2017 15,309,691  $ 87.29         ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START Stock options/SARs outstanding and exercisable as of December 31, 2017:        Outstanding  Exercisable Exercise Prices  Shares Outstanding at 12/31/17  Weighted- Average Remaining Contractual Life (Years)  Weighted- Average Exercise Price  Aggregate Intrinsic Value 2  Shares Outstanding at 12/31/17  Weighted- Average Remaining Contractual Life (Years)  Weighted- Average Exercise Price  Aggregate Intrinsic Value 2 $22.17 - 57.85  1,562,670  1.96  $ 50.47  $  1,562,670  1.96  $ 50.47  $ $73.20 - 74.77  3,577,767  8.02  $ 74.74   1,645,141  7.83  $ 74.70  $83.00  5,266,798  7.17  $ 83.00   3,630,345  7.17  $ 83.00  $89.75 - 96.31  7,912,539  6.88  $ 94.17   5,291,414  5.74  $ 93.44  $102.13 - 110.09  3,180,121  3.74  $ 106.55   3,180,121  3.74  $ 106.55    21,499,895    $ 86.86  $ 1,520  15,309,691    $ 87.29  $ 1,075 ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START 1  No SARs were granted during the year ended December 31, 2017 . ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START 2  The difference between a stock awards exercise price and the underlying stocks closing market price at December 31, 2017 , for awards with market price greater than the exercise price.

Stock-based compensation expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period for awards with terms that specify cliff or graded vesting and contain only service conditions. Stock-based compensation expense for PRSUs is based on the probable number of shares expected to vest and is recognized primarily on a straight-line basis. Before tax, stock-based compensation expense for 2017 , 2016 and 2015 was $206 million , $218 million and $283 million , respectively, with a corresponding income tax benefit of $40 million , $61 million and $87 million , respectively. The amount of stock-based compensation expense capitalized for the years ended December 31, 2017 , 2016 and 2015 did not have a significant impact on our financial statements.  At December 31, 2017 , there was $150 million of total unrecognized compensation cost from stock-based compensation arrangements granted under the plans, which is related to non-vested stock-based awards. The compensation expense is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of approximately 1.8 years . We currently use shares in treasury stock to satisfy share award exercises.  The cash tax benefits realized from stock awards exercised for 2017 , 2016 and 2015 were $205 million , $104 million and $68 million , respectively. We use the direct only method and tax law ordering approach to calculate the tax effects of stock-based compensation.  ##TABLE_START 3. Derivative financial instruments and risk management ##TABLE_END  Our earnings and cash flow are subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates and commodity prices. Our Risk Management Policy (policy) allows for the use of derivative financial instruments to prudently manage foreign currency exchange rate, interest rate and commodity price exposures. Our policy specifies that derivatives are not to be used for speculative purposes. Derivatives that we use are primarily foreign currency forward, option and cross currency contracts, interest rate contracts and commodity forward and option contracts. Our derivative activities are subject to the management, direction and control of our senior financial officers. Risk management practices, including the use of financial derivative instruments, are presented to the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors at least annually.  All derivatives are recognized in Statement 3 at their fair value. On the date the derivative contract is entered into, we designate the derivative as (1) a hedge of the fair value of a recognized asset or liability (fair value hedge), (2) a hedge of a forecasted transaction or the variability of cash flow (cash flow hedge) or (3) an undesignated instrument. Changes in the fair value of a derivative that is qualified, designated and highly effective as a fair value hedge, along with the gain or loss on the hedged recognized asset or liability that is attributable to the hedged risk, are recorded in current earnings. Changes in the fair value of a derivative that is qualified, designated and highly effective as a cash flow hedge are recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) (AOCI), to the extent effective, in Statement 3 until they are reclassified to earnings in the same period or periods during which the hedged transaction affects earnings. Changes in the fair value of undesignated derivative instruments and the ineffective portion of designated derivative instruments are reported in current earnings. Cash flows from designated derivative financial instruments are classified within the same category as the item being hedged on Statement 5. Cash flows from undesignated derivative financial instruments are included in the investing category on Statement 5.  We formally document all relationships between hedging instruments and hedged items, as well as the risk-management objective and strategy for undertaking various hedge transactions. This process includes linking all derivatives that are designated as fair value hedges to specific assets and liabilities in Statement 3 and linking cash flow hedges to specific forecasted transactions or variability of cash flow.  We also formally assess, both at the hedges inception and on an ongoing basis, whether the designated derivatives that are used in hedging transactions are highly effective in offsetting changes in fair values or cash flow of hedged items. When a derivative is determined not to be highly effective as a hedge or the underlying hedged transaction is no longer probable, we discontinue hedge accounting prospectively, in accordance with the derecognition criteria for hedge accounting.  ##TABLE_START A. Foreign currency exchange rate risk ##TABLE_END  Foreign currency exchange rate movements create a degree of risk by affecting the U.S. dollar value of sales made and costs incurred in foreign currencies. Movements in foreign currency rates also affect our competitive position as these changes may affect business practices and/or pricing strategies of non-U.S.-based competitors. Additionally, we have balance sheet positions denominated in foreign currencies, thereby creating exposure to movements in exchange rates.  Our Machinery, Energy  Transportation operations purchase, manufacture and sell products in many locations around the world. As we have a diversified revenue and cost base, we manage our future foreign currency cash flow exposure on a net basis. We use foreign currency forward and option contracts to manage unmatched foreign currency cash inflow and outflow. Our objective is to minimize the risk of exchange rate movements that would reduce the U.S. dollar value of our foreign currency cash flow. Our policy allows for managing anticipated foreign currency cash flow for up to five years . As of December 31, 2017 , the maximum term of these outstanding contracts was approximately 51 months .  We generally designate as cash flow hedges at inception of the contract any Australian dollar, Brazilian real, British pound, Canadian dollar, Chinese yuan, euro, Indian rupee, Japanese yen, Mexican peso, Norwegian krona, Singapore dollar, or Thailand baht forward or option contracts that meet the requirements for hedge accounting and the maturity extends beyond the current quarter-end. Designation is performed on a specific exposure basis to support hedge accounting. The remainder of Machinery, Energy  Transportation foreign currency contracts are undesignated.  As of December 31, 2017 , $5 million of deferred net losses, net of tax, included in equity (AOCI in Statement 3), are expected to be reclassified to current earnings (Other income (expense) in Statement 1) over the next twelve months when earnings are affected by the hedged transactions. The actual amount recorded in Other income (expense) will vary based on exchange rates at the time the hedged transactions impact earnings.  In managing foreign currency risk for our Financial Products operations, our objective is to minimize earnings volatility resulting from conversion and the remeasurement of net foreign currency balance sheet positions, and future transactions denominated in foreign currencies. Our policy allows the use of foreign currency forward, option and cross currency contracts to offset the risk of currency mismatch between our assets and liabilities, and exchange rate risk associated with future transactions denominated in foreign currencies. Our foreign currency forward, option and cross currency contracts are primarily undesignated. We designate fixed-to-fixed cross currency contracts as cash flow hedges to protect against movements in exchange rates on foreign currency fixed rate assets and liabilities.  ##TABLE_START B. Interest rate risk ##TABLE_END  Interest rate movements create a degree of risk by affecting the amount of our interest payments and the value of our fixed-rate debt. Our practice is to use interest rate contracts to manage our exposure to interest rate changes.  Our Machinery, Energy  Transportation operations generally use fixed-rate debt as a source of funding. Our objective is to minimize the cost of borrowed funds. Our policy allows us to enter into fixed-to-floating interest rate contracts and forward rate agreements to meet that objective. We designate fixed-to-floating interest rate contracts as fair value hedges at inception of the contract, and we designate certain forward rate agreements as cash flow hedges at inception of the contract. Financial Products operations has a match-funding policy that addresses interest rate risk by aligning the interest rate profile (fixed or floating rate) of Cat Financials debt portfolio with the interest rate profile of their receivables portfolio within predetermined ranges on an ongoing basis. In connection with that policy, we use interest rate derivative instruments to modify the debt structure to match assets within the receivables portfolio. This matched funding reduces the volatility of margins between interest-bearing assets and interest-bearing liabilities, regardless of which direction interest rates move.  Our policy allows us to use fixed-to-floating, floating-to-fixed and floating-to-floating interest rate contracts to meet the match-funding objective. We designate fixed-to-floating interest rate contracts as fair value hedges to protect debt against changes in fair value due to changes in the benchmark interest rate. We designate most floating-to-fixed interest rate contracts as cash flow hedges to protect against the variability of cash flows due to changes in the benchmark interest rate. We have, at certain times, liquidated fixed-to-floating and floating-to-fixed interest rate contracts at both Machinery, Energy  Transportation and Financial Products. The gains or losses associated with these contracts at the time of liquidation are amortized into earnings over the original term of the previously designated hedged item.  ##TABLE_START C. Commodity price risk ##TABLE_END  Commodity price movements create a degree of risk by affecting the price we must pay for certain raw material. Our policy is to use commodity forward and option contracts to manage the commodity risk and reduce the cost of purchased materials.  Our Machinery, Energy  Transportation operations purchase base and precious metals embedded in the components we purchase from suppliers. Our suppliers pass on to us price changes in the commodity portion of the component cost. In addition, we are subject to price changes on energy products such as natural gas and diesel fuel purchased for operational use.  Our objective is to minimize volatility in the price of these commodities. Our policy allows us to enter into commodity forward and option contracts to lock in the purchase price of a portion of these commodities within a five -year horizon. All such commodity forward and option contracts are undesignated. The location and fair value of derivative instruments reported in Statement 3 are as follows: ##TABLE_START  Consolidated Statement of Financial Position Location  Asset (Liability) Fair Value (Millions of dollars)   Years ended December 31,     Designated derivatives      Foreign exchange contracts      Machinery, Energy  Transportation Receivables  trade and other  $  $ Machinery, Energy  Transportation Long-term receivables  trade and other    Machinery, Energy  Transportation Accrued expenses  (14 )  (93 ) Machinery, Energy  Transportation Other liabilities  (2 )  (36 ) Financial Products Long-term receivables  trade and other   Financial Products Accrued expenses  (57 )  (3 ) Interest rate contracts      Financial Products Long-term receivables  trade and other   Financial Products Accrued expenses  (2 )  (1 )    $ (53 )  $ (87 )       Undesignated derivatives      Foreign exchange contracts      Machinery, Energy  Transportation Receivables  trade and other  $  $  Machinery, Energy  Transportation Accrued expenses  (9 )  (30 ) Financial Products Receivables  trade and other   Financial Products Accrued expenses  (9 )  (4 ) Commodity contracts      Machinery, Energy  Transportation Receivables  trade and other      $  $       ##TABLE_ENDThe total notional amounts of the derivative instruments are as follows: ##TABLE_START  Years ended December 31, (Millions of dollars)        Machinery, Energy  Transportation  $ 3,190  $ 2,530 Financial Products  $ 3,691  $ 2,626      ##TABLE_ENDThe notional amounts of the derivative financial instruments do not represent amounts exchanged by the parties.

Under these master netting agreements, net settlement generally permits the company or the counterparty to determine the net amount payable for contracts due on the same date and in the same currency for similar types of derivative transactions. The master netting agreements generally also provide for net settlement of all outstanding contracts with a counterparty in the case of an event of default or a termination event. Collateral is generally not required of the counterparties or of our company under the master netting agreements. As of December 31, 2017 and 2016 , no cash collateral was received or pledged under the master netting agreements.

Income taxes ##TABLE_END On December 22, 2017, U.S. tax legislation was enacted containing a broad range of tax reform provisions including a corporate tax rate reduction and changes in the U.S. taxation of non-U.S. earnings. We have not completed our accounting for the income tax effects of U.S. tax reform. However, we have made a reasonable estimate of the 2017 financial statement impact as of January 18, 2018, and recognized a provisional charge of $2.371 billion . We will continue to update our calculations as additional required information is prepared and analyzed, interpretations and assumptions are refined, additional guidance is issued, and due to actions we may take as a result of the legislation. These updates could significantly impact the provision for income taxes, the amount of taxes payable, and the deferred tax asset and liability balances. The provisionally estimated charge includes a $596 million write-down of net deferred tax assets to reflect the reduction in the U.S. corporate tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent beginning January 1, 2018. We are still analyzing certain aspects of the law and refining our calculations of basis differences as of December 31, 2017, which could affect the measurement of these balances. The provisionally estimated charge includes $1.775 billion for the estimated cost of a mandatory deemed repatriation of non-U.S. earnings, including changes in the deferred tax liability related to the amount of earnings considered not indefinitely reinvested as well as the amount of unrecognized tax benefits and state tax liabilities associated with these tax positions. The U.S. federal tax cost for the mandatory deemed repatriation is computed at 15.5 percent for non-U.S. earnings held in liquid assets and 8 percent for non-liquid assets, reduced by applicable foreign tax credits. These estimates are provisional due to additional information and analysis required to determine cumulative taxable earnings since 1986 for non-U.S. subsidiaries at two separate points in time and to determine the amount of earnings that are held in liquid versus non-liquid assets as defined in the new legislation at several different measurement periods. In addition, information is being gathered and analyzed to support available foreign tax credits including estimates of credit utilization and valuation allowance considerations for any remaining foreign tax credit carryforward. Due to uncertainty about aspects of the tax law, we have made various assumptions to determine our reasonable estimate that we expect to refine as additional guidance is issued. As a result of U.S. tax reform legislation, distributions of profits from non-U.S. subsidiaries are not expected to cause a significant U.S. tax impact in the future. However, these distributions may be subject to non-U.S. withholding taxes if profits are distributed from certain jurisdictions. We have recorded a deferred tax liability of $138 million for withholding taxes in non-U.S. jurisdictions where earnings are not considered indefinitely reinvested. Additional information and analysis are needed to determine the final amount of deferred tax liability considering factors such as whether non-U.S. entities are subject to withholding taxes, have reserve requirements, or have projected working capital and other capital needs in the country where the earnings were generated that would result in a decision to indefinitely reinvest a portion or all their earnings.

See Note 10 for further discussion. ##TABLE_END Included in the line item above labeled \"Non-U.S. subsidiaries taxed at other than 35%\" are the effects of earnings of non-U.S. subsidiaries taxed at local tax rates, changes in the amount of unrecognized tax benefits associated with these earnings, losses at non-U.S. subsidiaries without local tax benefits due to valuation allowances, and other permanent differences between tax and U.S. GAAP results. Caterpillar SARL (CSARL), primarily taxable locally in Switzerland, contributes the most significant amount of this line item. Although not individually significant by jurisdiction, pre-tax permanent differences due to nondeductible net foreign exchange gains/losses of non-U.S. subsidiaries were approximately $160 million of net gains in 2017 and $130 million of net losses in 2016 and 2015 . The provision for income taxes for 2017 also includes a decrease in the valuation allowance for U.S. state deferred tax assets resulting in a $111 million non-cash benefit, net of federal deferred tax adjustment at 35 percent . The primary driver of the decrease is improved U.S. GAAP profits expected to recur in certain state jurisdictions. This reverses a significant portion of the increase in the valuation allowance for U.S. state deferred tax assets in 2016 that resulted in a $141 million non-cash charge, net of federal deferred tax adjustment at 35 percent . The provision for income taxes for 2015 included a prior year net tax and interest charge of $42 million to increase unrecognized tax benefits by $68 million offset by a benefit of $26 million to record U.S. refund claims related to prior tax years currently under examination. In the audit of 2007 to 2009 including the loss carryback to 2005, the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (IRS) disallowed approximately $125 million of foreign tax credits that arose as a result of certain financings unrelated to CSARL. Decisions of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit involving other taxpayers in 2015 caused us to conclude the benefits of this uncertain tax position were no longer more likely than not to be sustained based on technical merits resulting in an increase of $68 million to unrecognized tax benefits. We continue to monitor ongoing court cases involving other taxpayers for information that may impact our analysis of this tax position. ##TABLE_START The components of profit (loss) before taxes were:         Years ended December 31, (Millions of dollars)    U.S.  $  $ (2,053 )  $ Non-U.S.  3,842  2,192  2,803   $ 4,082  $  $ 3,439        ##TABLE_END Profit before taxes, as shown above, is based on the location of the entity to which such earnings are attributable.

We recognized a net provision for interest and penalties of $38 million , $34 million and $20 million during the years ended December 31, 2017 , 2016 and 2015 , respectively. The total amount of interest and penalties accrued was $157 million and $120 million as of December 31, 2017 and 2016 , respectively.  On January 31, 2018, we received a Revenue Agent's Report from the IRS indicating the end of the field examination of our U.S. income tax returns for 2010 to 2012. In the audits of 2007 to 2012 including the impact of a loss carryback to 2005, the IRS has proposed to tax in the United States profits earned from certain parts transactions by CSARL, based on the IRS examination teams application of the substance-over-form or assignment-of-income judicial doctrines. We are vigorously contesting the proposed increases to tax and penalties for these years of approximately $2.3 billion . We believe that the relevant transactions complied with applicable tax laws and did not violate judicial doctrines. We have filed U.S. income tax returns on this same basis for years after 2012. Based on the information currently available, we do not anticipate a significant increase or decrease to our unrecognized tax benefits for this matter within the next 12 months. We currently believe the ultimate disposition of this matter will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position, liquidity or results of operations. With the exception of a loss carryback to 2005, tax years prior to 2007 are generally no longer subject to U.S. tax assessment. In our major non-U.S. jurisdictions including Australia, Brazil, China, Germany, Japan, Mexico, Switzerland, Singapore and the U.K., tax years are typically subject to examination for three to ten years . Due to the uncertainty related to the timing and potential outcome of audits, we cannot estimate the range of reasonably possible change in unrecognized tax benefits in the next 12 months. ##TABLE_START 6.

Accordingly, this presentation should not be regarded as a forecast of future cash collections. Please refer to Note 18 and Table III for fair value information.  ##TABLE_START C. Allowance for credit losses ##TABLE_END  The allowance for credit losses is an estimate of the losses inherent in Cat Financials finance receivable portfolio and includes consideration of accounts that have been individually identified as impaired, as well as pools of finance receivables where it is probable that certain receivables in the pool are impaired but the individual accounts cannot yet be identified. In identifying and measuring impairment, management takes into consideration past loss experience, known and inherent risks in the portfolio, adverse situations that may affect the borrowers ability to repay, estimated value of underlying collateral and current economic conditions. Accounts are identified for individual review based on past-due status and information available about the customer, such as financial statements, news reports and published credit ratings, as well as general information regarding industry trends and the economic environment in which Cat Financials customers operate. The allowance for credit losses attributable to finance receivables that are individually evaluated and determined to be impaired is based on the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the receivables' effective interest rate, the fair value of the collateral for collateral-dependent receivables or the observable market price of the receivable. In determining collateral value, Cat Financial estimates the current fair market value of the collateral less selling costs. Cat Financial also considers credit enhancements such as additional collateral and contractual third-party guarantees. The allowance for credit losses attributable to the remaining accounts not yet individually identified as impaired is estimated based on loss forecast models utilizing probabilities of default, our estimate of the loss emergence period and the estimated loss given default. In addition, qualitative factors not able to be fully captured in the loss forecast models including industry trends, macroeconomic factors and model imprecision are considered in the evaluation of the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses. These qualitative factors are subjective and require a degree of management judgment. Cat Financials allowance for credit losses is segregated into two portfolio segments:  ##TABLE_START  Customer - Finance receivables with retail customers. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  Dealer - Finance receivables with Caterpillar dealers. ##TABLE_END A portfolio segment is the level at which the Company develops a systematic methodology for determining its allowance for credit losses.  Cat Financial further evaluates portfolio segments by the class of finance receivables, which is defined as a level of information (below a portfolio segment) in which the finance receivables have the same initial measurement attribute and a similar method for assessing and monitoring credit risk. Typically, Cat Financials finance receivables within a geographic area have similar credit risk profiles and methods for assessing and monitoring credit risk. Cat Financials classes, which align with management reporting for credit losses, are as follows:  ##TABLE_START  North America - Finance receivables originated in the United States and Canada. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  Europe - Finance receivables originated in Europe, Africa, Middle East and the Commonwealth of Independent States. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  Asia Pacific - Finance receivables originated in Australia, New Zealand, China, Japan, and Southeast Asia. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  Mining - Finance receivables related to large mining customers worldwide and project financing in various countries. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  Latin America - Finance receivables originated in Mexico, Central and South American countries. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  Caterpillar Power Finance - Finance receivables related to marine vessels with Caterpillar engines worldwide and Caterpillar electrical power generation, gas compression and co-generation systems and non-Caterpillar equipment that is powered by these systems worldwide. ##TABLE_END An analysis of the allowance for credit losses was as follows: ##TABLE_START (Millions of dollars)  December 31, 2017   Customer  Dealer  Total Allowance for Credit Losses:       Balance at beginning of year  $  $  $ Receivables written off  (157 )    (157 ) Recoveries on receivables previously written off     Provision for credit losses   (1 )  Other     Balance at end of year  $  $  $        Individually evaluated for impairment  $  $   $ Collectively evaluated for impairment    Ending Balance  $  $  $        Recorded Investment in Finance Receivables:       Individually evaluated for impairment  $  $   $ Collectively evaluated for impairment  18,226  3,464  21,690 Ending Balance  $ 19,168  $ 3,464  $ 22,632        ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START (Millions of dollars)  December 31, 2016   Customer  Dealer  Total Allowance for Credit Losses:       Balance at beginning of year  $  $  $ Receivables written off  (158 )    (158 ) Recoveries on receivables previously written off     Provision for credit losses    Other  (5 )    (5 ) Balance at end of year  $  $  $        Individually evaluated for impairment  $  $   $ Collectively evaluated for impairment    Ending Balance  $  $  $        Recorded Investment in Finance Receivables:       Individually evaluated for impairment  $  $   $ Collectively evaluated for impairment  18,236  3,375  21,611 Ending Balance  $ 19,022  $ 3,375  $ 22,397        ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START        ##TABLE_ENDCredit quality of finance receivables  At origination, Cat Financial evaluates credit risk based on a variety of credit quality factors including prior payment experience, customer financial information, credit-rating agency ratings, loan-to-value ratios and other internal metrics. On an ongoing basis, Cat Financial monitors credit quality based on past-due status and collection experience as there is a meaningful correlation between the past-due status of customers and the risk of loss. In determining past-due status, Cat Financial considers the entire recorded investment in finance receivable past due when any installment is over 30 days past due. The tables below summarize the recorded investment of finance receivables by aging category. ##TABLE_START (Millions of dollars)  December 31, 2017   31-60 Days Past Due  61-90 Days Past Due  91+ Days Past Due  Total Past Due  Current  Total Finance Receivables  91+ Still Accruing Customer               North America  $  $  $  $  $ 7,950  $ 8,078  $ Europe      2,718  2,795  Asia Pacific      2,009  2,043  Mining      1,751  1,815  Latin America      1,531  1,765   Caterpillar Power Finance      2,476  2,672  Dealer               North America          1,920  1,920   Europe             Asia Pacific             Mining             Latin America           Caterpillar Power Finance             Total  $  $  $  $  $ 21,827  $ 22,632  $                ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (Millions of dollars)  December 31, 2016   31-60 Days Past Due  61-90 Days Past Due  91+ Days Past Due  Total Past Due  Current  Total Finance Receivables  91+ Still Accruing Customer               North America  $  $  $  $  $ 7,938  $ 8,063  $ Europe      2,388  2,455  Asia Pacific      1,435  1,474  Mining      1,756  1,824  Latin America      1,808  2,095   Caterpillar Power Finance      3,018  3,111  Dealer               North America          1,916  1,916   Europe             Asia Pacific             Mining             Latin America             Caterpillar Power Finance             Total  $  $  $  $  $ 21,718  $ 22,397  $                ##TABLE_END Impaired finance receivables  For all classes, a finance receivable is considered impaired, based on current information and events, if it is probable that Cat Financial will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms.

Recognition is resumed and previously suspended income is recognized when the finance receivable becomes current and collection of remaining amounts is considered probable. Payments received while the finance receivable is on non-accrual status are applied to interest and principal in accordance with the contractual terms.  As of December 31, 2017 and 2016 there were no finance receivable on non-accrual status for the Dealer portfolio segment.

Concessions granted may include extended contract maturities, inclusion of interest only periods, below market interest rates, extended skip payment periods and reduction of principal and/or accrued interest. As of December 31, 2017, there were no additional funds committed to lend to a borrower whose terms have been modified in a TDR. As of December 31, 2016, there were $11 million of additional funds committed to lend to a borrower whose terms have been modified in a TDR.  There were no finance receivables modified as TDRs during the years ended December 31, 2017 , 2016 or 2015 for the Dealer portfolio segment.

In 2016 , gross customer relationship intangibles of $96 million and related accumulated amortization of $27 million as well as gross intellectual property intangibles of $111 million and related accumulated amortization of $48 million from the Resource Industries segment were impaired. The fair value of these intangibles was determined to be insignificant based on an income approach using expected cash flows. The fair value determination is categorized as Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy due to its use of internal projections and unobservable measurement inputs. The total impairment of $132 million was a result of restructuring activities and is included in Other operating (income) expense in Statement 1. See Note 25 for information on restructuring costs. Amortization expense related to intangible assets was $323 million , $326 million and $337 million for 2017 , 2016 and 2015 , respectively. As of December 31, 2017 , amortization expense related to intangible assets is expected to be: ##TABLE_START (Millions of dollars)      Thereafter $  $  $  $  $  $            ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START B. Goodwill ##TABLE_END  There were no goodwill impairments during 2017 or 2015 . Our annual impairment tests completed in the fourth quarter of 2016 indicated the fair value of each reporting unit was substantially above its respective carrying value, including goodwill, with the exception of our Surface Mining  Technology reporting unit. The Surface Mining  Technology reporting unit, which primarily serves the mining industry, is a part of our Resource Industries segment. The goodwill assigned to this reporting unit is largely from our acquisition of Bucyrus International, Inc. in 2011. Its product portfolio includes large mining trucks, electric rope shovels, draglines, hydraulic shovels and related parts. In addition to equipment, Surface Mining  Technology also develops and sells technology products and services to provide customer fleet management, equipment management analytics and autonomous machine capabilities. The annual impairment test completed in the fourth quarter of 2016 indicated that the fair value of Surface Mining  Technology was below its carrying value requiring the second step of the goodwill impairment test process. The fair value of Surface Mining  Technology was determined primarily using an income approach based on a discounted ten year cash flow. We assigned the fair value to Surface Mining  Technologys assets and liabilities using various valuation techniques that required assumptions about royalty rates, dealer attrition, technological obsolescence and discount rates. The resulting implied fair value of goodwill was below the carrying value. Accordingly, we recognized a goodwill impairment charge of $595 million , which resulted in goodwill of $629 million remaining for Surface Mining  Technology as of October 1, 2016. The fair value determination is categorized as Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy due to its use of internal projections and unobservable measurement inputs. There was a $17 million tax benefit associated with this impairment charge. The changes in carrying amount of goodwill by reportable segment for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 were as follows: ##TABLE_START (Millions of dollars)  December 31, 2016  Acquisitions  Impairment Loss  Other Adjustments 1  December 31, 2017 Construction Industries           Goodwill  $  $   $   $  $ Impairment  (22 )        (22 ) Net goodwill        Resource Industries           Goodwill  4,110       4,232 Impairment  (1,175 )        (1,175 ) Net goodwill  2,935       3,057 Energy  Transportation           Goodwill  2,756       2,806 All Other 2           Goodwill       (1 )  Consolidated total           Goodwill  7,217       7,397 Impairment  (1,197 )        (1,197 ) Net goodwill  $ 6,020  $   $   $  $ 6,200              December 31, 2015  Acquisitions  Impairment Loss  Other Adjustments 1  December 31, 2016 Construction Industries           Goodwill  $  $   $   $  $ Impairment  (22 )        (22 ) Net goodwill        Resource Industries           Goodwill  4,145      (35 )  4,110 Impairment  (580 )    (595 )    (1,175 ) Net goodwill  3,565    (595 )  (35 )  2,935 Energy  Transportation           Goodwill  2,738     (19 )  2,756 All Other 2           Goodwill        Consolidated total           Goodwill  7,217     (37 )  7,217 Impairment  (602 )    (595 )    (1,197 ) Net goodwill  $ 6,615  $  $ (595 )  $ (37 )  $ 6,020 ##TABLE_END1 Other adjustments are comprised primarily of foreign currency translation. 2 Includes All Other operating segments (See Note 23). ##TABLE_START      ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START 11. Investments in debt and equity securities ##TABLE_END  We have investments in certain debt and equity securities, primarily at Insurance Services, that have been classified as available-for-sale and recorded at fair value. In addition, Insurance Services has an equity security investment in a real estate investment trust (REIT) which is recorded at fair value based on the net asset value (NAV) of the investment. These investments are primarily included in Other assets in Statement 3.

Postemployment benefit plans ##TABLE_END  We provide defined benefit pension plans, defined contribution plans and/or other postretirement benefit plans (retirement health care and life insurance) to employees in many of our locations throughout the world. Our defined benefit pension plans provide a benefit based on years of service and/or the employees average earnings near retirement. Our defined contribution plans allow employees to contribute a portion of their salary to help save for retirement, and in most cases, we provide a matching contribution. The benefit obligation related to our non-U.S. defined benefit pension plans are for employees located primarily in Europe, Japan and Brazil. For other postretirement benefits (OPEB), substantially all of our benefit obligation is for employees located in the United States.  Our U.S. defined benefit pension plans for support and management employees were frozen for certain employees on December 31, 2010, and will freeze for remaining employees on December 31, 2019. On the respective transition dates employees move to a retirement benefit that provides a frozen pension benefit and a 401(k) plan that will include a matching contribution and a new annual employer contribution. In the first quarter of 2017, we announced the closure of our Gosselies, Belgium facility. This announcement impacted certain employees that participated in a defined benefit pension plan and resulted in a net loss of $20 million for curtailment and termination benefits. In addition during first quarter of 2017, we announced the decision to phase out production at our Aurora, Illinois, facility, which resulted in termination benefits of $9 million for certain hourly employees that participate in our U.S. hourly defined benefit pension plan. During 2015 the company offered a voluntary retirement enhancement program to qualifying U.S. employees. This voluntary program impacted employees participating in certain U.S. pension and OPEB plans and resulted in a curtailment loss of $82 million . All curtailments and termination benefits were recognized in Other operating (income) expenses in Statement 1. Beginning in 2016, we elected to utilize a full yield curve approach in the estimation of service and interest costs by applying the specific spot rates along the yield curve used in the determination of the benefit obligation to the relevant projected cash flows. Service and interest costs in 2017 and 2016 were lower by $140 million and $180 million , respectively, under the new method than they would have been under the previous method. This change had no impact on our year-end defined benefit pension and OPEB obligations or our annual net periodic benefit cost as the lower service and interest costs were entirely offset in the actuarial loss (gain) reported for the respective year. This change was accounted for prospectively as a change in accounting estimate. ##TABLE_START A.

The U.S. discount rate is based on a benefit cash flow-matching approach and represents the rate at which our benefit obligations could effectively be settled as of our measurement date, December 31. The benefit cash flow-matching approach involves analyzing Caterpillars projected cash flows against a high quality bond yield curve, calculated using a wide population of corporate Aa bonds available on the measurement date. The very highest and lowest yielding bonds (top and bottom 10 percent ) are excluded from the analysis. A similar process is used to determine the assumed discount rate for our most significant non-U.S. plans. This rate is sensitive to changes in interest rates. A decrease in the discount rate would increase our obligation and future expense. ##TABLE_START B.

The current U.S. pension target asset allocation is 30 percent equities and 70 percent fixed income. This target allocation will be revisited periodically to ensure it reflects our overall objectives. The non-U.S. pension weighted-average target allocations are 38 percent equities, 54 percent fixed income, 5 percent real estate and 3 percent other. The target allocations for each plan vary based upon local statutory requirements, demographics of plan participants and funded status. The non-U.S. plan assets are primarily invested in non-U.S. securities.  Our target allocation for the other postretirement benefit plans is 70 percent equities and 30 percent fixed income.  The U.S. plans are rebalanced to plus or minus 5 percentage points of the target asset allocation ranges on a monthly basis. The frequency of rebalancing for the non-U.S. plans varies depending on the plan. As a result of our diversification strategies, there are no significant concentrations of risk within the portfolio of investments.  The use of certain derivative instruments is permitted where appropriate and necessary for achieving overall investment policy objectives. The plans do not engage in derivative contracts for speculative purposes.  The accounting guidance on fair value measurements specifies a fair value hierarchy based upon the observability of inputs used in valuation techniques (Level 1, 2 and 3). See Note 18 for a discussion of the fair value hierarchy.  Fair values are determined as follows:  ##TABLE_START  Equity securities are primarily based on valuations for identical instruments in active markets. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Fixed income securities are primarily based upon models that take into consideration such market-based factors as recent sales, risk-free yield curves and prices of similarly rated bonds. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Real estate is stated at the funds net asset value or at appraised value. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Cash, short-term instruments and other are based on the carrying amount, which approximates fair value, or the funds net asset value. ##TABLE_END The fair value of the pension and other postretirement benefit plan assets by category is summarized below:  ##TABLE_START   December 31, 2017 (Millions of dollars)  Level 1  Level 2  Level 3  Measured at NAV  Total Assets at Fair Value U.S. Pension           Equity securities:           U.S. equities  $ 2,745  $   $  $  $ 2,930 Non-U.S. equities  1,573       1,588            Fixed income securities:           U.S. corporate bonds    5,886    5,995 Non-U.S. corporate bonds    1,165      1,165 U.S. government bonds         U.S. governmental agency mortgage-backed securities         Non-U.S. government bonds                    Real estate                    Cash, short-term instruments and other       Total U.S. pension assets  $ 4,491  $ 8,397  $  $  $ 13,416 ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START   December 31, 2016 (Millions of dollars)  Level 1  Level 2  Level 3  Measured at NAV  Total Assets at Fair Value U.S. Pension           Equity securities:           U.S. equities  $ 2,816  $   $  $  $ 2,995 Non-U.S. equities  1,653       1,658            Fixed income securities:           U.S. corporate bonds    4,273    4,389 Non-U.S. corporate bonds         U.S. government bonds         U.S. governmental agency mortgage-backed securities         Non-U.S. government bonds                    Real estate                    Cash, short-term instruments and other      Total U.S. pension assets  $ 4,562  $ 6,290  $  $  $ 11,354            ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START   December 31, 2017 (Millions of dollars)  Level 1  Level 2  Level 3  Measured at NAV  Total Assets at Fair Value Non-U.S. Pension           Equity securities:           U.S. equities  $  $   $   $  $ Non-U.S. equities       1,363 Global equities 1                   Fixed income securities:           U.S. corporate bonds         Non-U.S. corporate bonds       U.S. government bonds         Non-U.S. government bonds    1,229      1,229 Global fixed income 1                   Real estate                    Cash, short-term instruments and other 2        Total non-U.S. pension assets  $  $ 2,375  $  $ 1,290  $ 4,305 ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START   December 31, 2016 (Millions of dollars)  Level 1  Level 2  Level 3  Measured at NAV  Total Assets at Fair Value Non-U.S. Pension           Equity securities:           U.S. equities  $  $   $   $  $ Non-U.S. equities       Global equities 1                   Fixed income securities:           U.S. corporate bonds        Non-U.S. corporate bonds       U.S. government bonds         Non-U.S. government bonds    1,172      1,172 Global fixed income 1                   Real estate                    Cash, short-term instruments and other 2        Total non-U.S. pension assets  $ 1,219  $ 2,230  $  $  $ 3,887 1 Includes funds that invest in both U.S. and non-U.S. securities. 2 Includes funds that invest in multiple asset classes, hedge funds and other.            ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START   December 31, 2017 (Millions of dollars)  Level 1  Level 2  Level 3  Measured at NAV  Total Assets at Fair Value Other Postretirement Benefits           Equity securities:           U.S. equities  $  $  $   $   $ Non-U.S. equities                    Fixed income securities:           U.S. corporate bonds        Non-U.S. corporate bonds         U.S. government bonds         U.S. governmental agency mortgage-backed securities         Non-U.S. government bonds                    Cash, short-term instruments and other        Total other postretirement benefit assets  $  $  $   $  $ ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START   December 31, 2016 (Millions of dollars)  Level 1  Level 2  Level 3  Measured at NAV  Total Assets at Fair Value Other Postretirement Benefits           Equity securities:           U.S. equities  $  $  $   $   $ Non-U.S. equities                    Fixed income securities:           U.S. corporate bonds        Non-U.S. corporate bonds         U.S. government bonds         U.S. governmental agency mortgage-backed securities         Non-U.S. government bonds                    Cash, short-term instruments and other       Total other postretirement benefit assets  $  $  $   $  $            ##TABLE_ENDBelow are roll-forwards of assets measured at fair value using Level 3 inputs for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 .

For pension plans in which all or almost all of the plan's participants are inactive and other postretirement benefit plans in which all or almost all of the plan's participants are fully eligible for benefits under the plan, prior service cost (credit) are amortized using the straight-line method over the remaining life expectancy of those participants. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START 4  Actuarial loss (gain) represent the effects of actual results differing from our assumptions and the effects of changing assumptions. We recognize actuarial loss (gain) immediately through earnings upon the annual remeasurement in the fourth quarter, or on an interim basis as triggering events warrant remeasurement. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START 5  The weighted-average rates for 2018 are 6.3 percent and 5.2 percent for U.S. and non-U.S. pension plans, respectively. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START      ##TABLE_ENDThe discount rates used in the determination of our service and interest cost components are determined by utilizing a full yield curve approach which applies specific spot rates along the yield curve used in the determination of the benefit obligation to the relevant projected cash flows. In 2015, the discount rates used to determine these cost components were based on a single weighted-average discount rate based on the yield curve used to measure the benefit obligation at the beginning of the period.  Our U.S. expected long-term rate of return on plan assets is based on our estimate of long-term passive returns for equities and fixed income securities weighted by the allocation of our pension assets. Based on historical performance, we increase the passive returns due to our active management of the plan assets. To arrive at our expected long-term return, the amount added for active management was 0.80 percent for 2017 and 0.90 percent for 2016 and 0.95 percent for 2015 . A similar process is used to determine this rate for our non-U.S. plans.  The assumed health care trend rate represents the rate at which health care costs are assumed to increase. We assumed a weighted-average increase of 6.6 percent in our calculation of 2017 benefit expense. We expect a weighted-average increase of 6.1 percent during 2018. The 2018 rates are assumed to decrease gradually to the ultimate health care trend rate of 5 percent in 2022 . This rate represents 3 percent general inflation plus 2 percent additional health care inflation. Assumed health care cost trend rates have a significant effect on the amounts reported for the health care plans. A one-percentage-point change in assumed health care cost trend rates would have the following effects: ##TABLE_START (Millions of dollars)  One-percentage- point increase  One-percentage- point decrease Effect on 2017 service and interest cost components of other postretirement benefit cost  $  $ (12 ) Effect on accumulated postretirement benefit obligation  $  $ (136 ) ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START F. Other postemployment benefit plans ##TABLE_END  We offer long-term disability benefits, continued health care for disabled employees, survivor income benefit insurance and supplemental unemployment benefits to substantially all U.S. employees. ##TABLE_START G. Defined contribution plans ##TABLE_END  We have both U.S. and non-U.S. employee defined contribution plans to help employees save for retirement. Our primary U.S. 401(k) plan allows eligible employees to contribute a portion of their cash compensation to the plan on a tax-deferred basis. Employees with frozen defined benefit pension accruals are eligible for matching contributions equal to 100 percent of employee contributions to the plan up to 6 percent of cash compensation and an annual employer contribution that ranges from 3 to 5 percent of cash compensation (depending on years of service and age). Employees that are still accruing benefits under a defined benefit pension plan are eligible for matching contributions equal to 50 percent of employee contributions up to 6 percent of cash compensation. These 401(k) plans include various investment funds, including a non-leveraged employee stock ownership plan (ESOP). As of December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016 , the ESOP held 17.7 million and 21.3 million shares, respectively. All of the shares held by the ESOP were allocated to participant accounts. Dividends paid to participants are automatically reinvested into company shares unless the participant elects to have all or a portion of the dividend paid to the participant. Various other U.S. and non-U.S. defined contribution plans allow eligible employees to contribute a portion of their salary to the plans, and in most cases, we provide a matching contribution to the funds.

Based on management's allocation decision, which can be revised from time to time, the portion of the Credit Facility available to MET as of December 31, 2017 was $2.75 billion . Our three Credit Facilities are:  ##TABLE_START  The 364 -day facility of $3.15 billion (of which $0.82 billion is available to MET) expires in September 2018. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  The three -year facility, as amended and restated in September 2017, of $2.73 billion (of which $0.72 billion is available to MET) expires in September 2020. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  The five -year facility, as amended and restated in September 2017, of $4.62 billion (of which $1.21 billion is available to MET) expires in September 2022. ##TABLE_END Other consolidated credit lines with banks as of December 31, 2017 totaled $4.59 billion . These committed and uncommitted credit lines, which may be eligible for renewal at various future dates or have no specified expiration date, are used primarily by our subsidiaries for local funding requirements. Caterpillar or Cat Financial may guarantee subsidiary borrowings under these lines. At December 31, 2017 , Caterpillar's consolidated net worth was $13.72 billion , which was above the $9.00 billion required under the Credit Facility. The consolidated net worth is defined as the consolidated shareholder's equity including preferred stock but excluding the pension and other postretirement benefits balance within Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). At December 31, 2017 , Cat Financial's covenant interest coverage ratio was 1.88 to 1 . This is above the 1.15 to 1 minimum ratio, calculated as (1) profit excluding income taxes, interest expense and net gain/(loss) from interest rate derivatives to (2) interest expense calculated at the end of each calendar quarter for the rolling four quarter period then most recently ended, required by the Credit Facility. In addition, at December 31, 2017 , Cat Financial's six-month covenant leverage ratio was 7.38 to 1 and year-end covenant leverage ratio was 7.71 to 1 . This is below the maximum ratio of debt to net worth of 10 to 1 , calculated (1) on a monthly basis as the average of the leverage ratios determined on the last day of each of the six preceding calendar months and (2) at each December 31, required by the Credit Facility. In the event Caterpillar or Cat Financial does not meet one or more of their respective financial covenants under the Credit Facility in the future (and are unable to obtain a consent or waiver), the syndicate of banks may terminate the commitments allocated to the party that does not meet its covenants. Additionally, in such event, certain of Cat Financial's other lenders under other loan agreements where similar financial covenants or cross default provisions are applicable, may, at their election, choose to pursue remedies under those loan agreements, including accelerating the repayment of outstanding borrowings. At December 31, 2017 , there were no borrowings under the Credit Facility.  ##TABLE_START 16.

In January 2014, the Board of Directors approved an authorization to repurchase up to $10.0 billion of Caterpillar common stock, which will expire on December 31, 2018. In July 2015, we entered into a definitive agreement with Citibank, N.A. to purchase shares of our common stock under an accelerated stock repurchase transaction (July 2015 ASR Agreement), which was completed in September 2015. Pursuant to the terms of the July 2015 ASR Agreement, a total of approximately 19.6 million shares of our common stock were repurchased at an aggregate cost to Caterpillar of $1.5 billion . For the year ended December 31, 2015, a total of 25.8 million shares of our common stock were repurchased at an aggregate cost to Caterpillar of $2.0 billion . We did not purchase any Caterpillar common stock during 2017 or 2016. Through the end of 2017, approximately $4.5 billion of the $10.0 billion authorization was spent.  ##TABLE_START 17.

Fair value measurements ##TABLE_END  The guidance on fair value measurements defines fair value as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants. This guidance also specifies a fair value hierarchy based upon the observability of inputs used in valuation techniques. Observable inputs (highest level) reflect market data obtained from independent sources, while unobservable inputs (lowest level) reflect internally developed market assumptions. In accordance with this guidance, fair value measurements are classified under the following hierarchy:  ##TABLE_START  Level 1   Quoted prices for identical instruments in active markets. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  Level 2  Quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active; and model-derived valuations in which all significant inputs or significant value-drivers are observable in active markets. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  Level 3  Model-derived valuations in which one or more significant inputs or significant value-drivers are unobservable. ##TABLE_END  When available, we use quoted market prices to determine fair value, and we classify such measurements within Level 1. In some cases where market prices are not available, we make use of observable market based inputs to calculate fair value, in which case the measurements are classified within Level 2. If quoted or observable market prices are not available, fair value is based upon valuations in which one or more significant inputs are unobservable, including internally developed models that use, where possible, current market-based parameters such as interest rates, yield curves and currency rates. These measurements are classified within Level 3. Fair value measurements are classified according to the lowest level input or value-driver that is significant to the valuation. A measurement may therefore be classified within Level 3 even though there may be significant inputs that are readily observable.  Fair value measurement includes the consideration of nonperformance risk. Nonperformance risk refers to the risk that an obligation (either by a counterparty or Caterpillar) will not be fulfilled. For financial assets traded in an active market (Level 1 and certain Level 2), the nonperformance risk is included in the market price. For certain other financial assets and liabilities (certain Level 2 and Level 3), our fair value calculations have been adjusted accordingly.  Investments in debt and equity securities Investments in certain debt and equity securities, primarily at Insurance Services, have been classified as available-for-sale and recorded at fair value. Fair values for our U.S. treasury bonds and large capitalization value and smaller company growth equity securities are based upon valuations for identical instruments in active markets. Fair values for other government bonds, corporate bonds and mortgage-backed debt securities are based upon models that take into consideration such market-based factors as recent sales, risk-free yield curves and prices of similarly rated bonds. In addition, Insurance Services has an equity investment in a real estate investment trust (REIT) which is recorded at fair value based on the net asset value (NAV) of the investment. See Note 11 for additional information on our investments in debt and equity securities.  Derivative financial instruments The fair value of interest rate contracts is primarily based on models that utilize the appropriate market-based forward swap curves and zero-coupon interest rates to determine discounted cash flows. The fair value of foreign currency and commodity forward, option and cross currency contracts is based on a valuation model that discounts cash flows resulting from the differential between the contract price and the market-based forward rate. Assets and liabilities measured on a recurring basis at fair value, primarily related to Financial Products, included in Statement 3 as of December 31, 2017 and 2016 are summarized below: ##TABLE_START   December 31, 2017 (Millions of dollars)  Level 1  Level 2  Level 3  Total Assets / Liabilities, at Fair Value Assets         Available-for-sale securities         Government debt         U.S. treasury bonds  $  $   $   $ Other U.S. and non-U.S. government bonds                Corporate bonds         Corporate bonds       Asset-backed securities                Mortgage-backed debt securities         U.S. governmental agency       Residential       Commercial                Equity securities         Large capitalization value       Smaller company growth       Total available-for-sale securities      1,329          REIT       Total Assets  $  $  $  $ 1,439          Liabilities         Derivative financial instruments, net  $   $  $   $ Total Liabilities  $   $  $   $          ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START   December 31, 2016 (Millions of dollars)  Level 1  Level 2  Level 3  Total Assets / Liabilities, at Fair Value Assets         Available-for-sale securities         Government debt         U.S. treasury bonds  $  $   $   $ Other U.S. and non-U.S. government bonds                Corporate bonds         Corporate bonds       Asset-backed securities                Mortgage-backed debt securities         U.S. governmental agency       Residential       Commercial                Equity securities         Large capitalization value       Smaller company growth       Total available-for-sale securities      1,288          REIT       Total Assets  $  $  $  $ 1,367          Liabilities         Derivative financial instruments, net  $   $  $   $ Total Liabilities  $   $  $   $          ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START          ##TABLE_ENDThe fair value of our REIT investment is measured based on NAV, which is considered a Level 3 input. A roll-forward of our REIT investment for the year ended December 31, 2017 is as follows: ##TABLE_START (Millions of dollars)   Balance at December 31, 2016  $ Purchases of securities  Sale of securities   Gains (losses) included in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss)  Balance at December 31, 2017  $    ##TABLE_END In addition to the amounts above, Cat Financial impaired loans are subject to measurement at fair value on a nonrecurring basis and are classified as Level 3 measurements. A loan is considered impaired when management determines that collection of contractual amounts due is not probable. In these cases, an allowance for credit losses may be established based either on the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the receivables' effective interest rate, the fair value of the collateral for collateral-dependent receivables, or the observable market price of the receivable. In determining collateral value, Cat Financial estimates the current fair market value of the collateral less selling costs. Cat Financial had impaired loans with a fair value of $341 million and $137 million for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 , respectively.  ##TABLE_START B. Fair values of financial instruments ##TABLE_END  In addition to the methods and assumptions we use to record the fair value of financial instruments as discussed in the Fair value measurements section above, we used the following methods and assumptions to estimate the fair value of our financial instruments:  Cash and short-term investments Carrying amount approximated fair value.  Restricted cash and short-term investments Carrying amount approximated fair value. Restricted cash and short-term investments are included in Prepaid expenses and other current assets in Statement 3.  Finance receivables Fair value was estimated by discounting the future cash flows using current rates, representative of receivables with similar remaining maturities.  Wholesale inventory receivables Fair value was estimated by discounting the future cash flows using current rates, representative of receivables with similar remaining maturities.  Short-term borrowings Carrying amount approximated fair value.  Long-term debt Fair value for fixed and floating rate debt was estimated based on quoted market prices. Guarantees The fair value of guarantees is based upon our estimate of the premium a market participant would require to issue the same guarantee in a stand-alone arms-length transaction with an unrelated party. If quoted or observable market prices are not available, fair value is based upon internally developed models that utilize current market-based assumptions.  Please refer to the table below for the fair values of our financial instruments.  ##TABLE_START TABLE IIIFair Values of Financial Instruments        (Millions of dollars)  Carrying Amount  Fair Value  Carrying Amount  Fair Value  Fair Value Levels  Reference Assets at December 31,             Cash and short-term investments  $ 8,261  $ 8,261  $ 7,168  $ 7,168   Statement 3 Restricted cash and short-term investments       Statement 3 Investments in debt and equity securities  1,439  1,439  1,367  1,367  1, 2  3  Notes 11  19 Finance receivablesnet (excluding finance leases 1 )  15,452  15,438  16,172  16,056   Notes 6  19 Wholesale inventory receivablesnet (excluding finance leases 1 )  1,153  1,123  1,500  1,464   Notes 6  19 Interest rate swapsnet       Notes 3  19 Commodity contractsnet       Notes 3  19              Liabilities at December 31,             Short-term borrowings  4,837  4,837  7,303  7,303   Note 13 Long-term debt (including amounts due within one year):             Machinery, Energy  Transportation  7,935  9,863  8,943  10,348   Note 14 Financial Products  22,106  22,230  20,537  20,724   Note 14 Foreign currency contractsnet       Notes 3  19 Guarantees       Note 21 ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START 1  Total excluded items have a net carrying value at December 31, 2017 and 2016 of $7,063 million and $6,111 million , respectively. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START      ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START 19. Concentration of credit risk ##TABLE_END  Financial instruments with potential credit risk consist primarily of trade and finance receivables and short-term and long-term investments. Additionally, to a lesser extent, we have a potential credit risk associated with counterparties to derivative contracts.  Trade receivables are primarily short-term receivables from independently owned and operated dealers and customers which arise in the normal course of business. We perform regular credit evaluations of our dealers and customers. Collateral generally is not required, and the majority of our trade receivables are unsecured. We do, however, when deemed necessary, make use of various devices such as security agreements and letters of credit to protect our interests. No single dealer or customer represents a significant concentration of credit risk.  Finance receivables and wholesale inventory receivables primarily represent receivables under installment sales contracts, receivables arising from leasing transactions and notes receivable. We generally maintain a secured interest in the equipment financed. No single customer or dealer represents a significant concentration of credit risk.  Short-term and long-term investments are held with high quality institutions and, by policy, the amount of credit exposure to any one institution is limited. Long-term investments, primarily included in Other assets in Statement 3, are comprised primarily of available-for-sale securities at Insurance Services.  For derivative contracts, collateral is generally not required of the counterparties or of our company. The company generally enters into International Swaps and Derivatives Association (ISDA) master netting agreements within Machinery, Energy  Transportation and Financial Products that permit the net settlement of amounts owed under their respective derivative contracts. Our exposure to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the counterparties is limited to only those gains that we have recorded, but for which we have not yet received cash payment. The master netting agreements reduce the amount of loss the company would incur should the counterparties fail to meet their obligations. At December 31, 2017 and 2016 , the maximum exposure to credit loss was $74 million and $96 million , respectively, before the application of any master netting agreements. Please refer to Note 18 and Table III above for fair value information.  ##TABLE_START 20. Operating leases ##TABLE_END  We lease certain property, computer and communications equipment, transportation equipment and other equipment through operating leases. Total rental expense for operating leases was $331 million , $375 million and $371 million for 2017 , 2016 and 2015 , respectively.  Minimum payments for operating leases having initial or remaining non-cancelable terms in excess of one year are:  ##TABLE_START Years ended December 31, (Millions of dollars)      Thereafter  Total $  $  $  $  $  $  $              ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START 21. Guarantees and product warranty ##TABLE_END  Caterpillar dealer performance guarantees We have provided an indemnity to a third-party insurance company for potential losses related to performance bonds issued on behalf of Caterpillar dealers. The bonds have varying terms and are issued to insure governmental agencies against nonperformance by certain dealers. We also provided guarantees to third-parties related to the performance of contractual obligations by certain Caterpillar dealers. These guarantees have varying terms and cover potential financial losses incurred by the third-parties resulting from the dealers nonperformance. In 2016, we provided a guarantee to an end user related to the performance of contractual obligations by a Caterpillar dealer. Under the guarantee, which expires in 2025, non-performance by the Caterpillar dealer could require Caterpillar to satisfy the contractual obligations by providing goods, services or financial compensation to the end user up to an annual designated cap.  Customer loan guarantees We provide loan guarantees to third-party lenders for financing associated with machinery purchased by customers. These guarantees have varying terms and are secured by the machinery. In addition, Cat Financial participates in standby letters of credit issued to third parties on behalf of their customers. These standby letters of credit have varying terms and beneficiaries and are secured by customer assets. Supplier consortium performance guarantees We have provided guarantees to a customer in Brazil and a customer in Europe related to the performance of contractual obligations by supplier consortiums to which our Caterpillar subsidiaries are members. The guarantees cover potential damages incurred by the customers resulting from the supplier consortiums' non-performance. The damages are capped except for failure of the consortiums to meet certain obligations outlined in the contract in the normal course of business. The guarantees will expire when the supplier consortiums perform all their contractual obligations, which are expected to be completed in 2022 for the customer in Europe and 2025 for the customer in Brazil. Third party logistics business lease guarantees We have provided guarantees to third-party lessors for certain properties leased by a third party logistics business, formerly Caterpillar Logistics Services LCC, in which we sold our equity interest in 2015. The guarantees are for the possibility that the third party logistics business would default on real estate lease payments. The guarantees were granted at lease inception and generally will expire at the end of the lease terms. We have dealer performance guarantees and third party performance guarantees that do not limit potential payment to end users related to indemnities and other commercial contractual obligations. In addition, we have entered into contracts involving industry standard indemnifications that do not limit potential payment. For these unlimited guarantees, we are unable to estimate a maximum potential amount of future payments that could result from claims made. No significant loss has been experienced or is anticipated under any of these guarantees. At both December 31, 2017 and 2016 , the related liability was $8 million . The maximum potential amount of future payments (undiscounted and without reduction for any amounts that may possibly be recovered under recourse or collateralized provisions) we could be required to make under the guarantees at December 31 are as follows:  ##TABLE_START (Millions of dollars)   Caterpillar dealer performance guarantees  $ 1,313  $ 1,384 Customer loan guarantees   Supplier consortium performance guarantees   Third party logistics business lease guarantees   Other guarantees   Total guarantees  $ 2,105  $ 1,856      ##TABLE_END Cat Financial provides guarantees to repurchase certain loans of Caterpillar dealers from a special-purpose corporation (SPC) that qualifies as a variable interest entity. The purpose of the SPC is to provide short-term working capital loans to Caterpillar dealers. This SPC issues commercial paper and uses the proceeds to fund its loan program. Cat Financial has a loan purchase agreement with the SPC that obligates Cat Financial to purchase certain loans that are not paid at maturity. Cat Financial receives a fee for providing this guarantee, which provides a source of liquidity for the SPC. Cat Financial is the primary beneficiary of the SPC as its guarantees result in Cat Financial having both the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the SPCs economic performance and the obligation to absorb losses, and therefore Cat Financial has consolidated the financial statements of the SPC. As of December 31, 2017 and 2016 , the SPCs assets of $1,107 million and $1,088 million , respectively, were primarily comprised of loans to dealers, and the SPCs liabilities of $1,106 million and $1,087 million , respectively, were primarily comprised of commercial paper. The assets of the SPC are not available to pay Cat Financial's creditors. Cat Financial may be obligated to perform under the guarantee if the SPC experiences losses. No loss has been experienced or is anticipated under this loan purchase agreement.  Cat Financial is party to agreements in the normal course of business with selected customers and Caterpillar dealers in which they commit to provide a set dollar amount of financing on a pre-approved basis. They also provide lines of credit to certain customers and Caterpillar dealers, of which a portion remains unused as of the end of the period. Commitments and lines of credit generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses. It has been Cat Financial's experience that not all commitments and lines of credit will be used. Management applies the same credit policies when making commitments and granting lines of credit as it does for any other financing.  Cat Financial does not require collateral for these commitments/lines, but if credit is extended, collateral may be required upon funding. The amount of the unused commitments and lines of credit for dealers as of December 31, 2017 and 2016 was $10,993 million and $12,775 million , respectively. The amount of the unused commitments and lines of credit for customers as of December 31, 2017 and 2016 was $3,092 million and $3,340 million , respectively.  Our product warranty liability is determined by applying historical claim rate experience to the current field population and dealer inventory. Generally, historical claim rates are based on actual warranty experience for each product by machine model/engine size by customer or dealer location (inside or outside North America). Specific rates are developed for each product shipment month and are updated monthly based on actual warranty claim experience.  ##TABLE_START (Millions of dollars)    Warranty liability, January 1  $ 1,258  $ 1,354  Reduction in liability (payments)  (860 )  (909 )  Increase in liability (new warranties)  1,021   Warranty liability, December 31  $ 1,419  $ 1,258        ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START      ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START 22. Environmental and legal matters ##TABLE_END The Company is regulated by federal, state and international environmental laws governing our use, transport and disposal of substances and control of emissions. In addition to governing our manufacturing and other operations, these laws often impact the development of our products, including, but not limited to, required compliance with air emissions standards applicable to internal combustion engines. We have made, and will continue to make, significant research and development and capital expenditures to comply with these emissions standards. We are engaged in remedial activities at a number of locations, often with other companies, pursuant to federal and state laws. When it is probable we will pay remedial costs at a site, and those costs can be reasonably estimated, the investigation, remediation, and operating and maintenance costs are accrued against our earnings. Costs are accrued based on consideration of currently available data and information with respect to each individual site, including available technologies, current applicable laws and regulations, and prior remediation experience. Where no amount within a range of estimates is more likely, we accrue the minimum. Where multiple potentially responsible parties are involved, we consider our proportionate share of the probable costs. In formulating the estimate of probable costs, we do not consider amounts expected to be recovered from insurance companies or others. We reassess these accrued amounts on a quarterly basis. The amount recorded for environmental remediation is not material and is included in Accrued expenses. We believe there is no more than a remote chance that a material amount for remedial activities at any individual site, or at all the sites in the aggregate, will be required. On January 7, 2015, the Company received a grand jury subpoena from the U.S. District Court for the Central District of Illinois. The subpoena requests documents and information from the Company relating to, among other things, financial information concerning U.S. and non-U.S. Caterpillar subsidiaries (including undistributed profits of non-U.S. subsidiaries and the movement of cash among U.S. and non-U.S. subsidiaries). The Company has received additional subpoenas relating to this investigation requesting additional documents and information relating to, among other things, the purchase and resale of replacement parts by Caterpillar Inc. and non-U.S. Caterpillar subsidiaries, dividend distributions of certain non-U.S. Caterpillar subsidiaries, and Caterpillar SARL and related structures. On March 2-3, 2017, agents with the Department of Commerce, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and the Internal Revenue Service executed search and seizure warrants at three facilities of the Company in the Peoria, Illinois area, including its former corporate headquarters. The warrants identify, and agents seized, documents and information related to, among other things, the export of products from the United States, the movement of products between the United States and Switzerland, the relationship between Caterpillar Inc. and Caterpillar SARL, and sales outside the United States. It is the Companys understanding that the warrants, which concern both tax and export activities, are related to the ongoing grand jury investigation. The Company is continuing to cooperate with this investigation. The Company is unable to predict the outcome or reasonably estimate any potential loss; however, we currently believe that this matter will not have a material adverse effect on the Companys consolidated results of operations, financial position or liquidity. On March 20, 2014, Brazils Administrative Council for Economic Defense (CADE) published a Technical Opinion which named 18 companies and over 100 individuals as defendants, including two subsidiaries of Caterpillar Inc., MGE - Equipamentos e Servios Ferrovirios Ltda. (MGE) and Caterpillar Brasil Ltda. The publication of the Technical Opinion opened CADE's official administrative investigation into allegations that the defendants participated in anticompetitive bid activity for the construction and maintenance of metro and train networks in Brazil. While companies cannot be held criminally liable for anticompetitive conduct in Brazil, criminal charges have been brought against two current employees of MGE and one former employee of MGE involving the same conduct alleged by CADE. The Company has responded to all requests for information from the authorities. The Company is unable to predict the outcome or reasonably estimate the potential loss; however, we currently believe that this matter will not have a material adverse effect on the Company's consolidated results of operations, financial position or liquidity. On October 24, 2013, Progress Rail received a grand jury subpoena from the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California related to the former railcar repair operations of its subsidiary, United Industries, LLC (\"United\") at the intermodal rail yard at Terminal Island, California (\"Terminal Island\"). United complied with the subpoena and cooperated with the U.S. Attorney. After investigation, the U.S. Attorney alleged that United engaged in unnecessary and improper railcar repair activities and disposed of railcar parts by hand in the water surrounding its former Terminal Island operation. On December 7, 2017, United entered a guilty plea in U.S. District Court for the Central District of California to a single misdemeanor violation of the Refuse Act. As part of the agreement to enter the plea, United has paid $25 million in fines and restitution. In addition, we are involved in other unresolved legal actions that arise in the normal course of business. The most prevalent of these unresolved actions involve disputes related to product design, manufacture and performance liability (including claimed asbestos and welding fumes exposure), contracts, employment issues, environmental matters, intellectual property rights, tax and securities laws. The aggregate range of reasonably possible losses in excess of accrued liabilities, if any, associated with these unresolved legal actions is not material. In some cases, we cannot reasonably estimate a range of loss because there is insufficient information regarding the matter. However, we believe there is no more than a remote chance that any liability arising from these matters would be material. Although it is not possible to predict with certainty the outcome of these unresolved legal actions, we believe that these actions will not individually or in the aggregate have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations, financial position or liquidity. ##TABLE_START 23. Segment information ##TABLE_END  ##TABLE_START A. Basis for segment information ##TABLE_END  Our Executive Office is comprised of a Chief Executive Officer (CEO), five Group Presidents, a General Counsel  Corporate Secretary and a Chief Human Resources Officer. Group Presidents are accountable for a related set of end-to-end businesses that they manage. The General Counsel  Corporate Secretary leads the Law and Public Policy Division. The Chief Human Resources Officer leads the Human Resources Organization. The CEO allocates resources and manages performance at the Group President level. As such, the CEO serves as our Chief Operating Decision Maker and operating segments are primarily based on the Group President reporting structure.  Three of our operating segments, Construction Industries, Resource Industries and Energy  Transportation are led by Group Presidents. One operating segment, Financial Products, is led by a Group President who also has responsibility for Corporate Services. Corporate Services is a cost center primarily responsible for the performance of certain support functions globally and to provide centralized services; it does not meet the definition of an operating segment. One Group President leads two smaller operating segments that are included in the All Other operating segments. The Law and Public Policy Division and the Human Resources Organization are cost centers and do not meet the definition of an operating segment.  B.  Description of segments  We have six operating segments, of which four are reportable segments. Following is a brief description of our reportable segments and the business activities included in the All Other operating segments:  Construction Industries : A segment primarily responsible for supporting customers using machinery in infrastructure, forestry and building construction applications.

Inter-segment sales are a source of revenue for this segment.  Financial Products Segment : Provides financing alternatives to customers and dealers around the world for Caterpillar products, as well as financing for vehicles, power generation facilities and marine vessels that, in most cases, incorporate Caterpillar products. Financing plans include operating and finance leases, installment sale contracts, working capital loans and wholesale financing plans. The segment also provides insurance and risk management products and services that help customers and dealers manage their business risk. Insurance and risk management products offered include physical damage insurance, inventory protection plans, extended service coverage for machines and engines, and dealer property and casualty insurance. The various forms of financing, insurance and risk management products offered to customers and dealers help support the purchase and lease of our equipment.  All Other operating segments :  Primarily includes activities such as: business strategy, product management and development, and manufacturing of filters and fluids, undercarriage, tires and rims, ground engaging tools, fluid transfer products, precision seals, and rubber sealing and connecting components primarily for Cat products; parts distribution; distribution services responsible for dealer development and administration including a wholly owned dealer in Japan, dealer portfolio management and ensuring the most efficient and effective distribution of machines, engines and parts; digital investments for new customer and dealer solutions that integrate data analytics with state-of-the art digital technologies while transforming the buying experience. Results for the All Other operating segments are included as a reconciling item between reportable segments and consolidated external reporting.  C.  Segment measurement and reconciliations  There are several methodology differences between our segment reporting and our external reporting. The following is a list of the more significant methodology differences:  ##TABLE_START  Machinery, Energy  Transportation segment net assets generally include inventories, receivables, property, plant and equipment, goodwill, intangibles, accounts payable and customer advances. Liabilities other than accounts payable and customer advances are generally managed at the corporate level and are not included in segment operations. Financial Products Segment assets generally include all categories of assets. ##TABLE_END  ##TABLE_START  Segment inventories and cost of sales are valued using a current cost methodology. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  Goodwill allocated to segments is amortized using a fixed amount based on a 20 year useful life. This methodology difference only impacts segment assets; no goodwill amortization expense is included in segment profit. In addition, only a portion of goodwill for certain acquisitions made in 2011 or later has been allocated to segments. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  The present value of future lease payments for certain Machinery, Energy  Transportation operating leases is included in segment assets. The estimated financing component of the lease payments is excluded. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  Currency exposures for Machinery, Energy  Transportation are generally managed at the corporate level and the effects of changes in exchange rates on results of operations within the year are not included in segment profit. The net difference created in the translation of revenues and costs between exchange rates used for U.S. GAAP reporting and exchange rates used for segment reporting is reported as a methodology difference. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  Stock-based compensation expense is not included in segment profit. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  Postretirement benefit expenses are split; segments are generally responsible for service and prior service costs, with the remaining elements of net periodic benefit cost included as a methodology difference. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  Machinery, Energy  Transportation segment profit is determined on a pretax basis and excludes interest expense and other income/expense items. Financial Products Segment profit is determined on a pretax basis and includes other income/expense items. ##TABLE_END Reconciling items are created based on accounting differences between segment reporting and our consolidated external reporting. Please refer to pages 147 to 152 for financial information regarding significant reconciling items. Most of our reconciling items are self-explanatory given the above explanations. For the reconciliation of profit, we have grouped the reconciling items as follows:  ##TABLE_START  Corporate costs: These costs are related to corporate requirements primarily for compliance and legal functions for the benefit of the entire organization. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Restructuring costs: Primarily costs for employee separation, long-lived asset impairments and contract terminations. These costs are included in Other Operating (Income) Expenses. Restructuring costs also include other exit-related costs primarily for accelerated depreciation, project management costs, equipment relocation and inventory write-downs, and also LIFO inventory decrement benefits from inventory liquidations at closed facilities (all of which are primarily included in Cost of goods sold). A table, Reconciliation of Restructuring costs on page 149, has been included to illustrate how segment profit would have been impacted by the restructuring costs. See Note 25 for more information. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  Methodology differences: See previous discussion of significant accounting differences between segment reporting and consolidated external reporting. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  Timing: Timing differences in the recognition of costs between segment reporting and consolidated external reporting. For example, certain costs are reported on the cash basis for segment reporting and the accrual basis for consolidated external reporting. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START Segment Information (Millions of

On December 15, 2016, we acquired 100 percent of the equity in privately held Kemper Valve  Fittings Corp. (Kemper). Kemper is headquartered in Island Lake, Illinois and designs, manufactures, sells, and services high pressure flow iron to the well service segment of the Oil  Gas industry. This acquisition provides Caterpillar with a new product offering which complements its existing products in the Oil  Gas industry. The purchase price, net of $12 million of acquired cash, consisted of $92 million paid at closing, $1 million paid in 2017, and $8 million payable in 2018. In addition, there is contingent consideration with a fair value of $38 million as of the acquisition date which is comprised of two components: 1) our expected use of a charitable contribution carry forward for U.S. tax purposes acquired from Kemper which has an estimated maximum payment of $20 million and 2) a specified industry performance index price target during the period from January 1, 2017 to December 31, 2021 which is capped at $20 million per year. The contingent consideration is being remeasured each reporting period at its estimated fair value with any adjustment included in Other operating (income) expenses in Statement 1. The transaction was financed with available cash. Tangible assets as of the acquisition date were $147 million , recorded at their fair values, and included cash of $12 million , receivables of $7 million , short term investments of $3 million , net deferred tax assets of $21 million , inventories of $63 million , and property, plant and equipment of $41 million . Finite-lived intangible assets acquired of $8 million included customer relationships, developed technology and trade names. The finite lived intangible assets are being amortized on a straight-line basis over an amortization period of 10 years . Liabilities assumed as of the acquisition date were $6 million , which represented their fair values. Goodwill of $1 million , non-deductible for income tax purposes, represented the excess of the consideration transferred over the net assets recognized and represented the estimated future economic benefits arising from other assets acquired that could not be individually identified and separately recognized. The results of the acquired business for the period from the acquisition date are included in the accompanying consolidated financial statements and reported in the Energy  Transportation segment in Note 23. Assuming this transaction had been made at the beginning of any period presented, the consolidated pro forma results would not be materially different from reported results. RDS Manufacturing, Inc. In December 2015, we acquired 100 percent of the stock of RDS Manufacturing, Inc. (RDS). RDS, located in Broken Arrow, Oklahoma, is a privately owned manufacturer of highly engineered turbomachinery parts, primarily for the turbine engine and aerospace markets. The acquisition of RDS is expected to help grow our turbine business and deepen our manufacturing expertise. The purchase price, net of $1 million of acquired cash and $5 million of trade receivables due from Caterpillar, was approximately $85 million . We paid $74 million at closing with an additional $11 million paid in December 2017. The transaction was financed with available cash. Tangible assets acquired of $28 million , recorded at their fair values, were primarily inventories of $12 million and property, plant and equipment of $16 million . Liabilities assumed as of the acquisition date were $2 million , which represented their fair values. Goodwill of $59 million , substantially all of which is deductible for income tax purposes, represented the excess of the consideration transferred over the net assets recognized and represented the estimated future economic benefits arising from other assets acquired that could not be individually identified and separately recognized. Factors that contributed to a purchase price resulting in the recognition of goodwill include RDSs strategic fit into our manufacturing and product portfolio and the acquired assembled workforce. The results of the acquired business for the period from the acquisition date are included in the accompanying consolidated financial statements and are reported in the Energy  Transportation segment. Assuming this transaction had been made at the beginning of any period presented, the consolidated pro forma results would not be materially different from reported results. Rail Product Solutions, Inc. In October 2015, we acquired 100 percent of the stock in privately owned Rail Product Solutions, Inc. (RPS) from Amsted Rail Company, Inc. RPS is a leading North American provider of mission critical track fastening products and integrated fastening systems. The acquisition of RPS expands our portfolio of track related products and allows us to provide more comprehensive solutions to our customers. The purchase price was $165 million . The transaction was financed with available cash. Tangible assets acquired of $41 million , recorded at their fair values, were primarily receivables of $9 million , inventories of $6 million , property, plant and equipment of $17 million and an investment in an unconsolidated affiliated company of $9 million . Finite-lived intangible assets acquired of $82 million were primarily customer relationships and are being amortized on a straight-line basis over a weighted average period of approximately 15 years . Liabilities assumed as of the acquisition date were $11 million , which represented their fair values. Goodwill of $53 million , substantially all of which is deductible for income tax purposes, represented the excess of the consideration transferred over the net assets recognized and represented the estimated future economic benefits arising from other assets acquired that could not be individually identified and separately recognized. Factors that contributed to a purchase price resulting in the recognition of goodwill include RPSs strategic fit into our product and services portfolio and the acquired assembled workforce. The results of the acquired business for the period from the acquisition date are included in the accompanying consolidated financial statements and are reported in the Energy  Transportation segment. Assuming this transaction had been made at the beginning of any period presented, the consolidated pro forma results would not be materially different from reported results. 25. Restructuring costs  Our accounting for employee separations is dependent upon how the particular program is designed. For voluntary programs, eligible separation costs are recognized at the time of employee acceptance unless the acceptance requires explicit approval by the company. For involuntary programs, eligible costs are recognized when management has approved the program, the affected employees have been properly notified and the costs are estimable. Restructuring costs for 2017, 2016 and 2015 were as follows: ##TABLE_START        (Millions of dollars)    Employee separations 1  $  $  $ Contract terminations 1     Long-lived asset impairments 1    Defined benefit plan curtailments and termination benefits 1    Other 2    Total restructuring costs  $ 1,256  $ 1,019  $        1 Recognized in Other operating (income) expenses.       2 Represents costs related to our restructuring programs, primarily for accelerated depreciation, project management costs, equipment relocation and inventory write-downs, and also LIFO inventory decrement benefits from inventory liquidations at closed facilities (all of which are primarily included in Cost of goods sold).        ##TABLE_ENDIn 2017, about half of the restructuring costs were related to the closure of the facility in Gosselies, Belgium, within Construction Industries, and the remainder was related to other restructuring actions across the company. The restructuring costs in 2016 were primarily related to actions in Resource Industries in response to continued weakness in the mining industry. In addition, costs in 2016 resulted from our decision to discontinue production of on-highway vocational trucks within Energy  Transportation and other restructuring actions across the company. The restructuring costs in 2015 were primarily related to several restructuring programs across the company. Restructuring costs are a reconciling item between Segment profit and Consolidated profit before taxes. See Note 23 for more information. The following table summarizes the 2016 and 2017 employee separation activity: ##TABLE_START (Millions of dollars)  Liability balance at December 31, 2015 $ Increase in liability (separation charges) Reduction in liability (payments) (633 ) Liability balance at December 31, 2016 $ Increase in liability (separation charges) Reduction in liability (payments) (423 ) Liability balance at December 31, 2017 $   ##TABLE_END Most of the remaining liability balance as of December 31, 2017 is expected to be paid in 2018 and primarily includes employee separation payments related to closure of the Gosselies, Belgium, facility. In March 2017, Caterpillar informed Belgian authorities of the decision to proceed to a collective dismissal, which will lead to the closure of the Gosselies site, impacting about 2,000 employees. Production of Caterpillar products at the Gosselies site ended during the second quarter of 2017. The other operations and functions at the Gosselies site are expected to be gradually phased out by the end of the second quarter of 2018. We estimate restructuring costs incurred under this program to be about $675 million . In 2017, we recognized $653 million of restructuring costs which included $436 million of employee separation costs, $205 million for long-lived asset impairments and $77 million of other costs partially offset by a $65 million LIFO inventory decrement benefit. The remaining costs are expected to be recognized in 2018. Restructuring costs for the year ended December 31, 2016 were $1,019 million . Throughout 2016, we initiated the following restructuring plans: ##TABLE_START  In February 2016, we made the decision to discontinue production of on-highway vocational trucks. Based on the business climate in the truck industry and a thorough evaluation of the business, the company decided it would withdraw from this market. We recognized $104 million of restructuring costs, primarily related to long-lived asset impairments and sales discounts, which is substantially all the costs expected under this program. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  In the second half of 2016, we took additional restructuring actions in Resource Industries, including ending the production of track drills; pursuing strategic alternatives related to room and pillar products; consolidation of two product development divisions; and additional actions in response to ongoing weakness in the mining industry. For the year ended December 31, 2016, we incurred $369 million of restructuring costs for these plans primarily related to long-lived asset impairments, employee separation costs and inventory write-downs. ##TABLE_END In September 2015, we announced a large scale restructuring plan (the Plan) including a voluntary retirement enhancement program for qualifying U.S. employees, several voluntary separation programs outside of the U.S., additional involuntary programs throughout the company and manufacturing facility consolidations and closures expected to occur through 2018. The largest action among those included in the Plan was related to our European manufacturing footprint which led to the Gosselies, Belgium, facility, closure as discussed above. We incurred $817 million , $281 million and $569 million in 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively, for a total of $1,667 million . We expect to recognize approximately $200 million of additional restructuring costs related to the Plan in 2018. 26.

Based on that evaluation, the CEO and CFO concluded that the company's disclosure controls and procedures are effective as of the end of the period covered by this annual report.  Managements Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting The management of Caterpillar Inc. (company) is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act. Our internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of our financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Our internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.  Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.  Management assessed the effectiveness of the companys internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2017 . In making this assessment, we used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework (2013). Based on our assessment we concluded that, as of December 31, 2017 , the companys internal control over financial reporting was effective based on those criteria. The effectiveness of the companys internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2017 has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm. Their report appears on pages 73-74 of Part II, Item 8 \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\" Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting  During the last fiscal quarter, there has been no significant change in the companys internal control over financial reporting that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the companys internal control over financial reporting. ##TABLE_START ", "9B": " Item 9B.

Business. ##TABLE_END General  Originally organized as Caterpillar Tractor Co. in 1925 in the State of California, our company was reorganized as Caterpillar Inc. in 1986 in the State of Delaware. As used herein, the term Caterpillar, we, us, our or the company refers to Caterpillar Inc. and its subsidiaries unless designated or identified otherwise.  Overview  With 2018 sales and revenues of $54.722 billion , Caterpillar is the worlds leading manufacturer of construction and mining equipment, diesel and natural gas engines, industrial gas turbines and diesel-electric locomotives. The company principally operates through its three primary segments - Construction Industries, Resource Industries and Energy  Transportation - and also provides financing and related services through its Financial Products segment. Caterpillar is also a leading U.S. exporter. Through a global network of independent dealers and direct sales of certain products, Caterpillar builds long-term relationships with customers around the world.  Currently, we have six operating segments, of which four are reportable segments and are described below.  Categories of Business Organization  1.   Machinery, Energy  Transportation  Represents the aggregate total of Construction Industries, Resource Industries, Energy  Transportation and All Other operating segments and related corporate items and eliminations.  2.   Financial Products  Primarily includes the companys Financial Products Segment. This category includes Caterpillar Financial Services Corporation (Cat Financial), Caterpillar Insurance Holdings Inc. (Insurance Services) and their respective subsidiaries.  Other information about our operations in 2018 , including certain risks associated with our operations, is included in Part II, Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.  Construction Industries  Our Construction Industries segment is primarily responsible for supporting customers using machinery in infrastructure, forestry and building construction. The majority of machine sales in this segment are made in the heavy and general construction, rental, quarry and aggregates markets and mining.  The nature of customer demand for construction machinery varies around the world. Customers in developing economies often prioritize purchase price in making their investment decisions, while customers in developed economies generally weigh productivity and other performance criteria that contribute to lower owning and operating costs over the lifetime of the machine. To meet customer expectations in developing economies, Caterpillar developed differentiated product offerings that target customers in those markets, including our SEM brand machines. We believe that these customer-driven product innovations enable us to compete more effectively in developing economies. The majority of Construction Industries' research and development spending in 2018 focused on the next generation of construction machines.  The competitive environment for construction machinery is characterized by some global competitors and many regional and specialized local competitors. Examples of global competitors include CASE (part of CNH Industrial N.V.), Deere Construction  Forestry (part of Deere  Company), Doosan Infracore Co., Ltd., Hitachi Construction Machinery Co., Ltd., Hyundai Construction Equipment Co., Ltd., J.C. Bamford Excavators Ltd., Kobelco Construction Machinery (part of Kobe Steel, Ltd), Komatsu Ltd., Kubota Farm  Industrial Machinery (part of Kubota Corporation), and Volvo Construction Equipment (part of the Volvo Group). As an example of regional and local competitors, our competitors in China also include Guangxi LiuGong Machinery Co., Ltd., Longking Holdings Ltd., Sany Heavy Industry Co., Ltd., XCMG Group, Shandong Lingong Construction Machinery Co., Ltd. (SDLG, part of the Volvo Group) and Shantui Construction Machinery Co., Ltd., (part of Shandong Heavy Industry Group Co.). Each of these companies has varying product lines that compete with Caterpillar products, and each has varying degrees of regional focus.  The Construction Industries product portfolio includes the following machines and related parts and work tools:  ##TABLE_START    asphalt pavers   feller bunchers   telehandlers   backhoe loaders    harvesters   small and medium   compactors    knuckleboom loaders   track-type tractors   cold planers    motorgraders    track-type loaders  compact track and   pipelayers    wheel excavators  multi-terrain loaders   road reclaimers   compact, small and   mini, small, medium   site prep tractors   medium wheel loaders   and large excavators   skidders    utility vehicles   forestry excavators   skid steer loaders   ##TABLE_ENDResource Industries  The Resource Industries segment is primarily responsible for supporting customers using machinery in mining, quarry and aggregates, heavy construction, waste and material handling applications. Caterpillar offers a broad product range and services to deliver comprehensive solutions for our mining customers. We manufacture high productivity equipment for both surface and underground mining operations around the world. Our equipment is used to extract and haul copper, iron ore, coal, oil sands, aggregates, gold and other minerals and ores. In addition to equipment, Resource Industries also develops and sells technology products and services to provide customers fleet management systems, equipment management analytics and autonomous machine capabilities. Customers in most markets place an emphasis on equipment that is highly productive, reliable and provides the lowest total cost of ownership over the life of the equipment. In some developing markets, customers often prioritize purchase price in making their investment decisions. We believe our ability to control the integration and design of key machine components represents a competitive advantage. Our research and development efforts remain focused on providing customers the lowest total cost of ownership enabled through the highest quality, most productive products and services in the industry. The competitive environment for Resource Industries consists of a few larger global competitors that compete in several of the markets that we serve and a substantial number of smaller companies that compete in a more limited range of products, applications, and regional markets. Our global surface competitors include Deere Construction  Forestry (part of Deere  Company), Epiroc AB, Hitachi Construction Machinery Co., Ltd., Komatsu Ltd., Liebherr-International AG, Sandvik AB, and Volvo Construction Equipment. Our global underground competitors include Epiroc AB, Komatsu Ltd., Sandvik AB and Zhengzhou Coal Mining Machinery Group Co., Ltd. The Resource Industries product portfolio includes the following machines and related parts:  ##TABLE_START   electric rope shovels    longwall miners    landfill compactors   draglines    large wheel loaders    soil compactors   hydraulic shovels    off-highway trucks    machinery components   rotary drills    articulated trucks    electronics and control systems   hard rock vehicles    wheel tractor scrapers    select work tools   large track-type tractors    wheel dozers    hard rock continuous mining systems   large mining trucks     ##TABLE_END Energy  Transportation  Our Energy  Transportation segment supports customers in oil and gas, power generation, marine, rail and industrial applications, including Cat machines. The product and services portfolio includes reciprocating engines, generator sets, marine propulsion systems, gas turbines and turbine-related services, the remanufacturing of Caterpillar engines and components and remanufacturing services for other companies, diesel-electric locomotives and other rail-related products and services and product support of on-highway vocational trucks for North America.  Regulatory emissions standards require us to continue to make investments as new products and new regulations are introduced. On-going compliance with these regulations remains a focus. Emissions compliance in developing markets is complex due to rapidly evolving and unique requirements where enforcement processes can often vary. We employ robust product development and manufacturing processes to help us comply with these regulations.  The competitive environment for reciprocating engines in marine, oil and gas, industrial and electric power generation systems along with turbines in oil and gas and electric power generation consists of a few larger global competitors that compete in a variety of markets that Caterpillar serves, and a substantial number of smaller companies that compete in a limited-size product range, geographic region and/or application. Principal global competitors include Cummins Inc., Deutz AG, GE Power, Rolls-Royce Power Systems, Siemens Power and Gas, and Wrtsil Corp. Other competitors, such as Baker Hughes, a GE company , CNH Industrial Powertrain, INNIO, MAN Energy Solutions, Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Ltd., Volvo Penta, Weichai Power Co., Ltd.,and other emerging market competitors compete in certain markets in which Caterpillar competes. An additional set of competitors, including Aggreko plc, Generac Power Systems, Inc., Kohler Co., Inc., and others, are primarily packagers who source engines and/or other components from domestic and international suppliers and market products regionally and internationally through a variety of distribution channels. In rail-related businesses, our global competitors include Alstom Transport SA, Bombardier Transportation, GE Transportation, Greenbrier, Siemens AG, Voestalpine AG, Vossloh, and Wabtec Freight. We also compete with other companies on a more limited range of products, services and/or geographic regions. The Energy  Transportation portfolio includes the following products and related parts: ##TABLE_START  reciprocating engine powered generator sets ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  reciprocating engines supplied to the industrial industry as well as Caterpillar machinery ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  integrated systems used in the electric power generation industry ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  turbines, centrifugal gas compressors and related services ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  reciprocating engines and integrated systems and solutions for the marine and oil and gas industries ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  remanufactured reciprocating engines and components ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  diesel-electric locomotives and components and other rail-related products and services ##TABLE_END Financial Products Segment  The business of our Financial Products segment is primarily conducted by Cat Financial, a wholly owned finance subsidiary of Caterpillar. Cat Financials primary business is to provide retail and wholesale financing alternatives for Caterpillar products to customers and dealers around the world. Retail financing is primarily comprised of the financing of Caterpillar equipment, machinery and engines. Cat Financial also provides financing for vehicles, power generation facilities and marine vessels that, in most cases, incorporate Caterpillar products. In addition to retail financing, Cat Financial provides wholesale financing to Caterpillar dealers and purchases short-term trade receivables from Caterpillar and its subsidiaries. The various financing plans offered by Cat Financial are primarily designed to increase the opportunity for sales of Caterpillar products and generate financing income for Cat Financial. A significant portion of Cat Financials activity is conducted in North America, with additional offices and subsidiaries in Latin America, Asia/Pacific, Europe, Africa and Middle East.  For over 35 years, Cat Financial has been providing financing in the various markets in which it participates, contributing to its knowledge of asset values, industry trends, product structuring and customer needs.  In certain instances, Cat Financials operations are subject to supervision and regulation by state, federal and various foreign governmental authorities, and may be subject to various laws and judicial and administrative decisions imposing various requirements and restrictions which, among other things, (i) regulate credit granting activities and the administration of loans, (ii) establish maximum interest rates, finance charges and other charges, (iii) require disclosures to customers and investors, (iv) govern secured transactions, (v) set collection, foreclosure, repossession and other trade practices and (vi) regulate the use and reporting of information related to a borrowers credit experience. Cat Financials ability to comply with these and other governmental and legal requirements and restrictions affects its operations. Cat Financials retail loans (totaling 49 percent*) include: ##TABLE_START  Loans that allow customers and dealers to use their Caterpillar equipment or other assets as collateral to obtain financing (26 percent*). ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  Installment sale contracts, which are equipment loans that enable customers to purchase equipment with a down payment or trade-in and structure payments over time (23 percent*). ##TABLE_END Cat Financial's retail leases (totaling 34 percent*) include: ##TABLE_START  Tax leases that are classified as either operating or finance leases for financial accounting purposes, depending on the characteristics of the lease. For tax purposes, Cat Financial is considered the owner of the equipment (12 percent*). ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  Finance (non-tax) leases, where the lessee for tax purposes is considered to be the owner of the equipment during the term of the lease, that either require or allow the customer to purchase the equipment for a fixed price at the end of the term (21 percent*). ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  Governmental lease-purchase plans in the U.S. that offer low interest rates and flexible terms to qualified non-federal government agencies (1 percent*). ##TABLE_END  Cat Financials wholesale loans and leases (2 percent*) include inventory/rental programs, which provide assistance to dealers by financing their new Caterpillar inventory and rental fleets.  Cat Financial also purchases short-term receivables from Caterpillar at a discount (15 percent*).  *Indicates the percentage of Cat Financials total portfolio at December 31, 2018. We define total portfolio as total finance receivables (net of unearned income and allowance for credit losses) plus equipment on operating leases, less accumulated depreciation. For more information on the above and Cat Financials concentration of credit risk, please refer to Note 7  Cat Financial Financing Activities of Part II, Item 8 \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\" _____________________________  Cat Financial operates in a highly competitive environment, with financing for users of Caterpillar equipment available through a variety of sources, principally commercial banks and finance and leasing companies. Cat Financials competitors include Wells Fargo Equipment Finance Inc. and various other banks and finance companies. In addition, many of our manufacturing competitors own financial subsidiaries, such as John Deere Capital Corporation, Komatsu Financial L.P. and Volvo Financial Services, which utilize below-market interest rate programs (funded by the manufacturer) to assist machine sales. Caterpillar and Cat Financial work together to provide a broad array of financial merchandising programs around the world to meet these competitive offers.  Cat Financials financial results are largely dependent upon the ability of Caterpillar dealers to sell equipment and customers willingness to enter into financing or leasing agreements. It is also affected by, among other things, the availability of funds from its financing sources, general economic conditions such as inflation and market interest rates and its cost of funds relative to its competitors.  Cat Financial has a match-funding policy that addresses interest rate risk by aligning the interest rate profile (fixed or floating rate) of its debt portfolio with the interest rate profile of its receivables portfolio within predetermined ranges on an ongoing basis. In connection with that policy, Cat Financial uses interest rate derivative instruments to modify the debt structure to match assets within the receivables portfolio. This matched funding reduces the volatility of margins between interest-bearing assets and interest-bearing liabilities, regardless of which direction interest rates move. For more information regarding match funding, please see Note 4  Derivative financial instruments and risk management of Part II, Item 8 \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\" See also the risk factors associated with our financial products business included in Item 1 A. of this Form 10-K. In managing foreign currency risk for Cat Financials operations, the objective is to minimize earnings volatility resulting from conversion and the remeasurement of net foreign currency balance sheet positions, and future transactions denominated in foreign currencies. This policy allows the use of foreign currency forward, option and cross currency contracts to offset the risk of currency mismatch between the assets and liabilities, and exchange rate risk associated with future transactions denominated in foreign currencies.  Cat Financial provides financing only when certain criteria are met. Credit decisions are based on a variety of credit quality factors including prior payment experience, customer financial information, credit-rating agency ratings, loan-to-value ratios and other internal metrics. Cat Financial typically maintains a security interest in retail-financed equipment and requires physical damage insurance coverage on financed equipment. Cat Financial finances a significant portion of Caterpillar dealers sales and inventory of Caterpillar equipment throughout the world. Cat Financials competitive position is improved by marketing programs offered in conjunction with Caterpillar and/or Caterpillar dealers. Under these programs, Caterpillar, or the dealer, funds an amount at the outset of the transaction, which Cat Financial then recognizes as revenue over the term of the financing. We believe that these marketing programs provide Cat Financial a significant competitive advantage in financing Caterpillar products.  Caterpillar Insurance Company, a wholly owned subsidiary of Caterpillar Insurance Holdings Inc., is a U.S. insurance company domiciled in Missouri and primarily regulated by the Missouri Department of Insurance. Caterpillar Insurance Company is licensed to conduct property and casualty insurance business in 50 states, the District of Columbia and Guam, and as such, is also regulated in those jurisdictions.

In all markets, we compete on the basis of product performance, customer service, quality and price. From time to time, the intensity of competition results in price discounting in a particular industry or region. Such price discounting puts pressure on margins and can negatively impact operating profit. Outside the United States, certain competitors enjoy competitive advantages inherent to operating in their home countries or regions.  Raw Materials and Component Products  We source our raw materials and manufactured components from suppliers both domestically and internationally. These purchases include unformed materials and rough and finished parts. Unformed materials include a variety of steel products, which are then cut or formed to shape and machined in our facilities. Rough parts include various sized steel and iron castings and forgings, which are machined to final specification levels inside our facilities. Finished parts are ready to assemble components, which are made either to Caterpillar specifications or to supplier developed specifications. We machine and assemble some of the components used in our machines, engines and power generation units and to support our after-market dealer parts sales. We also purchase various goods and services used in production, logistics, offices and product development processes. We maintain global strategic sourcing models to meet our global facilities production needs while building long-term supplier relationships and leveraging enterprise spend. We expect our suppliers to maintain, at all times, industry-leading levels of quality and the ability to timely deliver raw materials and component products for our machine and engine products. However, increases in demand have led to parts and components constraints across some products. We use a variety of agreements with suppliers to protect our intellectual property and processes to monitor and mitigate risks of the supply base causing a business disruption. The risks monitored include supplier financial viability, the ability to increase or decrease production levels, business continuity, quality and delivery.  Patents and Trademarks  We own a number of patents and trademarks, which have been obtained over a period of years and relate to the products we manufacture and the services we provide. These patents and trademarks are generally considered beneficial to our business. We do not regard our business as being dependent upon any single patent or group of patents. Order Backlog  The dollar amount of backlog believed to be firm was approximately $16.5 billion at December 31, 2018 and $15.8 billion at December 31, 2017 . Compared with year-end 2017 , the order backlog increased about $0.7 billion. The increase was in Energy  Transportation and Construction Industries, partially offset by a decrease in Resource Industries. Of the total backlog at December 31, 2018 , approximately $3.3 billion was not expected to be filled in 2019 . Dealers and Distributors  Our machines are distributed principally through a worldwide organization of dealers (dealer network), 47 located in the United States and 121 located outside the United States, serving 193 countries. Reciprocating engines are sold principally through the dealer network and to other manufacturers for use in products. Some of the reciprocating engines manufactured by our subsidiary Perkins Engines Company Limited are also sold through its worldwide network of 90 distributors covering 177 countries. The FG Wilson branded electric power generation systems primarily manufactured by our subsidiary Caterpillar Northern Ireland Limited are sold through its worldwide network of 150 distributors covering 109 countries. Some of the large, medium speed reciprocating engines are also sold under the MaK brand through a worldwide network of 20 distributors covering 130 countries.  Our dealers do not deal exclusively with our products; however, in most cases sales and servicing of our products are the dealers principal business. Some products, primarily turbines and locomotives, are sold directly to end customers through sales forces employed by the company. At times, these employees are assisted by independent sales representatives. While the large majority of our worldwide dealers are independently owned and operated, we own and operate a dealership in Japan that covers approximately 80% of the Japanese market: Nippon Caterpillar Division. We are currently operating this Japanese dealer directly and its results are reported in the All Other operating segments. There are also three independent dealers in the Southern Region of Japan.  For Caterpillar branded products, the companys relationship with each of its independent dealers is memorialized in standard sales and service agreements. Pursuant to these agreements, the company grants the dealer the right to purchase and sell its products and to service the products in a specified geographic service territory. Prices to dealers are established by the company after receiving input from dealers on transactional pricing in the marketplace. The company also agrees to defend its intellectual property and to provide warranty and technical support to the dealer. The agreement further grants the dealer a non-exclusive license to use the companys trademarks, service marks and brand names. In some instances, a separate trademark agreement exists between the company and a dealer.  In exchange for these rights, the agreement obligates the dealer to develop and promote the sale of the companys products to current and prospective customers in the dealers service territory. Each dealer agrees to employ adequate sales and support personnel to market, sell and promote the companys products, demonstrate and exhibit the products, perform the companys product improvement programs, inform the company concerning any features that might affect the safe operation of any of the companys products and maintain detailed books and records of the dealers financial condition, sales and inventories and make these books and records available at the companys reasonable request.  These sales and service agreements are terminable at will by either party primarily upon 90 days written notice.  Employment  As of December 31, 2018 , we employed about 104,000 full-time persons of whom approximately 59,400 were located outside the United States. In the United States, we employed approximately 44,600 employees, most of whom are at-will employees and, therefore, not subject to any type of employment contract or agreement. At select business units, certain highly specialized employees have been hired under employment contracts that specify a term of employment, pay and other benefits.  ##TABLE_START Full-Time Employees at Year-End      Inside U.S. 44,600  42,200 Outside U.S. 59,400  56,200 Total 104,000  98,400     By Region:    North America 44,900  42,400 EAME 18,000  18,100 Latin America 17,300  15,000 Asia/Pacific 23,800  22,900 Total 104,000  98,400     ##TABLE_ENDAs of December 31, 2018 , there were approximately 9,560 U.S. hourly production employees who were covered by collective bargaining agreements with various labor unions, including The United Automobile, Aerospace and Agricultural Implement Workers of America (UAW), The International Association of Machinists and The United Steelworkers. Approximately 7,980 of such employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements with the UAW that expire on December 17, 2020 and March 1, 2023. Outside the United States, the company enters into employment contracts and agreements in those countries in which such relationships are mandatory or customary. The provisions of these agreements generally correspond in each case with the required or customary terms in the subject jurisdiction.  Environmental Matters  The company is regulated by federal, state and international environmental laws governing our use, transport and disposal of substances and control of emissions. In addition to governing our manufacturing and other operations, these laws often impact the development of our products, including, but not limited to, required compliance with air emissions standards applicable to internal combustion engines. We have made, and will continue to make, significant research and development and capital expenditures to comply with these emissions standards.  We are engaged in remedial activities at a number of locations, often with other companies, pursuant to federal and state laws. When it is probable we will pay remedial costs at a site, and those costs can be reasonably estimated, the investigation, remediation, and operating and maintenance costs of the remedial action are accrued against our earnings. Costs are accrued based on consideration of currently available data and information with respect to each individual site, including available technologies, current applicable laws and regulations, and prior remediation experience. Where no amount within a range of estimates is more likely, we accrue the minimum. Where multiple potentially responsible parties are involved, we consider our proportionate share of the probable costs. In formulating the estimate of probable costs, we do not consider amounts expected to be recovered from insurance companies or others. We reassess these accrued amounts on a quarterly basis. The amount recorded for environmental remediation is not material and is included in the line item \"Accrued expenses\" in Statement 3  \"Consolidated Financial Position at December 31\" of Part II, Item 8 \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\" There is no more than a remote chance that a material amount for remedial activities at any individual site, or at all the sites in the aggregate, will be required.

Risk Factors. ##TABLE_END  The statements in this section describe the most significant risks to our business and should be considered carefully in conjunction with Part II, Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements of Part II, Item 8 \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\" to this Form 10-K. In addition, the statements in this section and other sections of this Form 10-K, including in Part II, Item 7 \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,\" include forward-looking statements as that term is defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and involve uncertainties that could significantly impact results. Forward-looking statements give current expectations or forecasts of future events about the company or our outlook. You can identify forward-looking statements by the fact they do not relate to historical or current facts and by the use of words such as believe, expect, estimate, anticipate, will be, should, plan, forecast, target, guide, project, intend, could and similar words or expressions.  Forward-looking statements are based on assumptions and on known risks and uncertainties. Although we believe we have been prudent in our assumptions, any or all of our forward-looking statements may prove to be inaccurate, and we can make no guarantees about our future performance. Should known or unknown risks or uncertainties materialize or underlying assumptions prove inaccurate, actual results could materially differ from past results and/or those anticipated, estimated or projected. We undertake no obligation to publicly update forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. You should, however, consult any subsequent disclosures we make in our filings with the SEC on Form 10-Q or Form 8-K.  The following is a cautionary discussion of risks, uncertainties and assumptions that we believe are significant to our business. In addition to the factors discussed elsewhere in this report, the following are some of the important factors that, individually or in the aggregate, we believe could make our actual results differ materially from those described in any forward-looking statements. It is impossible to predict or identify all such factors and, as a result, you should not consider the following factors to be a complete discussion of risks, uncertainties and assumptions. MACROECONOMIC RISKS Our business and the industries we serve are highly sensitive to global and regional economic conditions.  Our results of operations are materially affected by economic conditions globally and regionally and in the particular industries we serve. The demand for our products and services tends to be cyclical and can be significantly reduced in periods of economic weakness characterized by lower levels of government and business investment, lower levels of business confidence, lower corporate earnings, high real interest rates, lower credit activity or tighter credit conditions, perceived or actual industry overcapacity, higher unemployment and lower consumer spending. A prolonged period of economic weakness may also result in increased expenses due to higher allowances for doubtful accounts and potential goodwill and asset impairment charges. Economic conditions vary across regions and countries, and demand for our products and services generally increases in those regions and countries experiencing economic growth and investment. Slower economic growth or a change in the global mix of regions and countries experiencing economic growth and investment could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.  The energy, transportation and mining industries are major users of our products, including the coal, iron ore, gold, copper, oil and natural gas industries. Customers in these industries frequently base their decisions to purchase our products and services on the expected future performance of these industries, which in turn are dependent in part on commodity prices. Prices of commodities in these industries are frequently volatile and can change abruptly and unpredictably in response to general economic conditions and trends, government actions, regulatory actions, commodity inventories, production and consumption levels, technological innovations, commodity substitutions, market expectations and any disruptions in production or distribution or changes in consumption. Economic conditions affecting the industries we serve may in the future also lead to reduced capital expenditures by our customers. Reduced capital expenditures by our customers are likely to lead to a decrease in the demand for our products and services and may also result in a decrease in demand for aftermarket parts as customers are likely to extend preventative maintenance schedules and delay major overhauls when possible.  The rates of infrastructure spending, commercial construction and housing starts also play a significant role in our results. Our products are an integral component of these activities, and as these activities decrease, demand for our products may be significantly impacted, which could negatively impact our results. Commodity price changes, material price increases, fluctuations in demand for our products, significant disruptions to our supply chains or significant shortages of material may adversely impact our financial results or our ability to meet commitments to customers.  We are a significant user of steel and many other commodities required for the manufacture of our products. Increases in the prices of such commodities would increase our costs, negatively impacting our business, results of operations and financial condition if we are unable to fully offset the effect of these increased costs through price increases, productivity improvements or cost reduction programs.  We rely on suppliers to produce or secure material required for the manufacture of our products. Production challenges at suppliers, a disruption in deliveries to or from suppliers or decreased availability of raw materials or commodities could have an adverse effect on our ability to meet our commitments to customers or increase our operating costs. The increase in demand in 2018 has led to challenges for certain products due to supplier constraints. Despite improvements in material flows, parts and components constraints remain across some products, which could impact our sales in 2019 as global suppliers continue to increase production to meet demand. On the other hand, in circumstances where demand for our products is less than we expect, we may experience excess inventories and be forced to incur additional costs and our profitability may suffer. Our business, competitive position, results of operations or financial condition could be negatively impacted if supply is insufficient for our operations, if we experience excess inventories or if we are unable to adjust our production schedules or our purchases from suppliers to reflect changes in customer demand and market fluctuations on a timely basis. Changes in government monetary or fiscal policies may negatively impact our results .  Most countries where our products and services are sold have established central banks to regulate monetary systems and influence economic activities, generally by adjusting interest rates. Interest rate changes affect overall economic growth, which affects demand for residential and nonresidential structures, as well as energy and mined products, which in turn affects sales of our products and services that serve these activities. Interest rate changes may also affect our customers ability to finance machine purchases, can change the optimal time to keep machines in a fleet and can impact the ability of our suppliers to finance the production of parts and components necessary to manufacture and support our products. Increases in interest rates could negatively impact sales and create supply chain inefficiencies.  Central banks and other policy arms of many countries may take actions to vary the amount of liquidity and credit available in an economy. The impact from a change in liquidity and credit policies could negatively affect the customers and markets we serve or our suppliers, which could adversely impact our business, results of operations and financial condition. Changes in monetary and fiscal policies, along with other factors, may cause currency exchange rates to fluctuate. Actions that lead the currency exchange rate of a country where we manufacture products to increase relative to other currencies could reduce the competitiveness of products made in that country, which could adversely affect our competitive position, results of operations and financial condition. Government policies on taxes and spending also affect our business. Throughout the world, government spending finances a significant portion of infrastructure development, such as highways, airports, sewer and water systems and dams. Tax regulations determine asset depreciation lives and impact the after-tax returns on business activity and investment, both of which influence investment decisions. Unfavorable developments, such as decisions to reduce public spending or increase taxes, could negatively impact our results. Our global operations are exposed to political and economic risks, commercial instability and global events beyond our control in the countries in which we operate.  Our global operations are dependent upon products manufactured, purchased and sold in the U.S. and internationally, including in countries with political and economic instability or uncertainty. This includes, for example, the uncertainty related to the United Kingdoms withdrawal from the European Union (commonly known as Brexit).  Some countries have greater political and economic volatility and greater vulnerability to infrastructure and labor disruptions than others. Our business could be negatively impacted by adverse fluctuations in freight costs, limitations on shipping and receiving capacity, and other disruptions in the transportation and shipping infrastructure at important geographic points of exit and entry for our products. Operating in different regions and countries exposes us to a number of risks, including: ##TABLE_START  multiple and potentially conflicting laws, regulations and policies that are subject to change; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  imposition of currency restrictions, restrictions on repatriation of earnings or other restraints; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  imposition of new or additional tariffs or quotas; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  withdrawal from or modification of trade agreements or the negotiation of new trade agreements; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  imposition of new or additional trade and economic sanctions laws imposed by the U.S. or foreign governments; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  war or terrorist acts; and ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  political and economic instability or civil unrest that may severely disrupt economic activity in affected countries. ##TABLE_END The occurrence of one or more of these events may negatively impact our business, results of operations and financial condition.  OPERATIONAL RISKS The success of our business depends on our ability to develop, produce and market quality products that meet our customers needs.  Our business relies on continued global demand for our brands and products. To achieve business goals, we must develop and sell products that appeal to our dealers, OEMs and end-user customers. This is dependent on a number of factors, including our ability to maintain key dealer relationships, our ability to produce products that meet the quality, performance and price expectations of our customers and our ability to develop effective sales, advertising and marketing programs. In addition, our continued success in selling products that appeal to our customers is dependent on leading-edge innovation, with respect to both products and operations, and on the availability and effectiveness of legal protection for our innovations. Failure to continue to deliver high quality, innovative, competitive products to the marketplace, to adequately protect our intellectual property rights, to supply products that meet applicable regulatory requirements, including engine exhaust emission requirements, or to predict market demands for, or gain market acceptance of, our products, could have a negative impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition. We operate in a highly competitive environment, which could adversely affect our sales and pricing.  We operate in a highly competitive environment. We compete on the basis of a variety of factors, including product performance, customer service, quality and price. There can be no assurance that our products will be able to compete successfully with other companies products. Thus, our share of industry sales could be reduced due to aggressive pricing or product strategies pursued by competitors, unanticipated product or manufacturing difficulties, our failure to price our products competitively, our failure to produce our products at a competitive cost or an unexpected buildup in competitors new machine or dealer-owned rental fleets, which could lead to downward pressure on machine rental rates and/or used equipment prices.  Lack of customer acceptance of price increases we announce from time to time, changes in customer requirements for price discounts, changes in our customers behavior or a weak pricing environment could have an adverse impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition.  In addition, our results and ability to compete may be impacted negatively by changes in our geographic and product mix of sales. Increased information technology security threats and more sophisticated computer crime pose a risk to our systems, networks, products and services. We rely upon information technology systems and networks, some of which are managed by third parties, in connection with a variety of business activities. Additionally, we collect and store data that is sensitive to Caterpillar. Operating these information technology systems and networks and processing and maintaining this data, in a secure manner, are critical to our business operations and strategy. Data we collect, store and process is subject to a variety of U.S. and international laws and regulations, such as the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation that became effective in May 2018, which carry, in many cases, significant potential penalties for noncompliance. Information technology security threats -- from user error to cybersecurity attacks designed to gain unauthorized access to our systems, networks and data -- are increasing in frequency and sophistication. Cybersecurity attacks may range from random attempts to coordinated and targeted attacks, including sophisticated computer crime and advanced persistent threats. These threats pose a risk to the security of our systems and networks and the confidentiality, availability and integrity of our data. Cybersecurity attacks could also include attacks targeting customer data or the security, integrity and/or reliability of the hardware and software installed in our products. While, to date, no cybersecurity attack has had a material impact on our financial condition, results of operations or liquidity, we have experienced cybersecurity attacks that have resulted in unauthorized parties gaining access to our information technology systems and networks, and we could in the future experience similar or more serious attacks. While we actively manage information technology security risks within our control, such actions may not be sufficient to mitigate all potential risks to our systems, networks and data. Further, the amount of insurance coverage we maintain may be inadequate to cover claims or liabilities relating to a cybersecurity attack. The potential consequences of a material cybersecurity attack include reputational damage, litigation with third parties, government enforcement actions, penalties, disruption to systems, unauthorized release of confidential or otherwise protected information, corruption of data, diminution in the value of our investment in research, development and engineering, and increased cybersecurity protection and remediation costs, which in turn could adversely affect our competitiveness, results of operations and financial condition. Our business is subject to the inventory management decisions and sourcing practices of our dealers and our OEM customers.  We sell finished products primarily through an independent dealer network and directly to OEMs and are subject to risks relating to their inventory management decisions and operational and sourcing practices. Both carry inventories of finished products as part of ongoing operations and adjust those inventories based on their assessments of future needs and market conditions, including levels of used equipment inventory and machine rental usage rates. Such adjustments may impact our results positively or negatively. If the inventory levels of our dealers and OEM customers are higher than they desire, they may postpone product purchases from us, which could cause our sales to be lower than the end-user demand for our products and negatively impact our results. Similarly, our results could be negatively impacted through the loss of time-sensitive sales if our dealers and OEM customers do not maintain inventory levels sufficient to meet customer demand. We may not realize all of the anticipated benefits of our acquisitions, joint ventures or divestitures, or these benefits may take longer to realize than expected. In pursuing our business strategy, we routinely evaluate targets and enter into agreements regarding possible acquisitions, divestitures and joint ventures. We often compete with others for the same opportunities. To be successful, we conduct due diligence to identify valuation issues and potential loss contingencies, negotiate transaction terms, complete complex transactions and manage post-closing matters such as the integration of acquired businesses. Further, while we seek to mitigate risks and liabilities of such transactions through, among other things, due diligence, there may be risks and liabilities that such due diligence efforts fail to discover, that are not accurately or completely disclosed to us or that we inadequately assess. We may incur unanticipated costs or expenses following a completed acquisition, including post-closing asset impairment charges, expenses associated with eliminating duplicate facilities, litigation, and other liabilities. Risks associated with our past or future acquisitions also include the following: ##TABLE_START  the business culture of the acquired business may not match well with our culture; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  technological and product synergies, economies of scale and cost reductions may not occur as expected; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  unforeseen expenses, delays or conditions may be imposed upon the acquisition, including due to required regulatory approvals or consents; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  we may acquire or assume unexpected liabilities or be subject to unexpected penalties or other enforcement actions; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  faulty assumptions may be made regarding the macroeconomic environment or the integration process; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  unforeseen difficulties may arise in integrating operations, processes and systems; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  higher than expected investments may be required to implement necessary compliance processes and related systems, including IT systems, accounting systems and internal controls over financial reporting; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  we may fail to retain, motivate and integrate key management and other employees of the acquired business; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  higher than expected costs may arise due to unforeseen changes in tax, trade, environmental, labor, safety, payroll or pension policies in any jurisdiction in which the acquired business conducts its operations; and ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  we may experience problems in retaining customers and integrating customer bases. ##TABLE_END Many of these factors will be outside of our control and any one of them could result in increased costs, decreases in the amount of expected revenues and diversion of managements time and attention. They may also delay the realization of the benefits we anticipate when we enter into a transaction.  In order to conserve cash for operations, we may undertake acquisitions financed in part through public offerings or private placements of debt or equity securities, or other arrangements. Such acquisition financing could result in a decrease in our earnings and adversely affect other leverage measures. If we issue equity securities or equity-linked securities, the issued securities may have a dilutive effect on the interests of the holders of our common shares.  Failure to implement our acquisition strategy, including successfully integrating acquired businesses, could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Furthermore, we make strategic divestitures from time to time. In the case of divestitures, we may agree to indemnify acquiring parties for certain liabilities arising from our former businesses. These divestitures may also result in continued financial involvement in the divested businesses, including through guarantees or other financial arrangements, following the transaction. Lower performance by those divested businesses could affect our future financial results. Union disputes or other labor matters could adversely affect our operations and financial results.  Some of our employees are represented by labor unions in a number of countries under various collective bargaining agreements with varying durations and expiration dates. There can be no assurance that any current or future issues with our employees will be resolved or that we will not encounter future strikes, work stoppages or other types of conflicts with labor unions or our employees. We may not be able to satisfactorily renegotiate collective bargaining agreements in the United States and other countries when they expire. If we fail to renegotiate our existing collective bargaining agreements, we could encounter strikes or work stoppages or other types of conflicts with labor unions. In addition, existing collective bargaining agreements may not prevent a strike or work stoppage at our facilities in the future. We may also be subject to general country strikes or work stoppages unrelated to our business or collective bargaining agreements. A work stoppage or other limitations on production at our facilities for any reason could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. In addition, many of our customers and suppliers have unionized work forces. Strikes or work stoppages experienced by our customers or suppliers could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Unexpected events, including natural disasters, may increase our cost of doing business or disrupt our operations.  The occurrence of one or more unexpected events, including war, terrorist acts or violence, civil unrest, fires, tornadoes, tsunamis, hurricanes, earthquakes, floods and other forms of severe weather in the United States or in other countries in which we operate or in which our suppliers are located could adversely affect our operations and financial performance. Natural disasters, pandemic illness, equipment failures, power outages or other unexpected events could result in physical damage to and complete or partial closure of one or more of our manufacturing facilities or distribution centers, temporary or long-term disruption in the supply of component products from some local and international suppliers, disruption in the transport of our products to dealers and end-users and delay in the delivery of our products to our distribution centers. Existing insurance coverage may not provide protection for all of the costs that may arise from such events. FINANCIAL RISKS Disruptions or volatility in global financial markets could limit our sources of liquidity, or the liquidity of our customers, dealers and suppliers.  Continuing to meet our cash requirements over the long-term requires substantial liquidity and access to varied sources of funds, including capital and credit markets. Global economic conditions may cause volatility and disruptions in the capital and credit markets. Market volatility, changes in counterparty credit risk, the impact of government intervention in financial markets and general economic conditions may also adversely impact our ability to access capital and credit markets to fund operating needs. Global or regional economic downturns could cause financial markets to decrease the availability of liquidity, credit and credit capacity for certain issuers, including certain customers, dealers and suppliers. An inability to access capital and credit markets may have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and competitive position. Furthermore, changes in global economic conditions, including material cost increases and decreases in economic activity in key markets we serve, and the success of plans to manage cost increases, inventory and other important elements of our business may significantly impact our ability to generate funds from operations.  In addition, demand for our products generally depends on customers ability to pay for our products, which, in turn, depends on their access to funds. Changes in global economic conditions may result in customers experiencing increased difficulty in generating funds from operations. Capital and credit market volatility and uncertainty may cause financial institutions to revise their lending standards, resulting in customers decreased access to capital. If capital and credit market volatility occurs, customers liquidity may decline which, in turn, would reduce their ability to purchase our products. Failure to maintain our credit ratings would increase our cost of borrowing and could adversely affect our cost of funds, liquidity, competitive position and access to capital markets.  Each of Caterpillars and Cat Financials costs of borrowing and their respective ability to access the capital markets are affected not only by market conditions but also by the short- and long-term credit ratings assigned to their respective debt by the major credit rating agencies. These ratings are based, in significant part, on each of Caterpillars and Cat Financials performance as measured by financial metrics such as net worth, interest coverage and leverage ratios, as well as transparency with rating agencies and timeliness of financial reporting. There can be no assurance that Caterpillar or Cat Financial will be able to maintain their credit ratings. We receive debt ratings from the major credit rating agencies. Moodys long- and short-term ratings of Caterpillar and Cat Financial are A3 and Prime-2 (low-A), while other major credit rating agencies maintain a mid-A debt rating. A downgrade of our credit rating by any of the major credit rating agencies would result in increased borrowing costs and could adversely affect Caterpillars and Cat Financials liquidity, competitive position and access to the capital markets, including restricting, in whole or in part, access to the commercial paper market. There can be no assurance that the commercial paper market will continue to be a reliable source of short-term financing for Cat Financial or an available source of short-term financing for Caterpillar. An inability to access the capital markets could have an adverse effect on our cash flow, results of operations and financial condition.  Our Financial Products segment is subject to risks associated with the financial services industry.  Cat Financial is significant to our operations and provides financing support to a significant share of our global sales. The inability of Cat Financial to access funds to support its financing activities to our customers could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Continuing to meet Cat Financial's cash requirements over the long-term could require substantial liquidity and access to sources of funds, including capital and credit markets. Cat Financial has continued to maintain access to key global medium term note and commercial paper markets, but there can be no assurance that such markets will continue to represent a reliable source of financing. If global economic conditions were to deteriorate, Cat Financial could face materially higher financing costs, become unable to access adequate funding to operate and grow its business and/or meet its debt service obligations as they mature, and be required to draw upon contractually committed lending agreements and/or seek other funding sources. However, there can be no assurance that such agreements and other funding sources would be available or sufficient under extreme market conditions. Any of these events could negatively impact Cat Financials business, as well as our and Cat Financial's results of operations and financial condition.  Market disruption and volatility may also lead to a number of other risks in connection with these events, including but not limited to: ##TABLE_START  Market developments that may affect customer confidence levels and cause declines in the demand for financing and adverse changes in payment patterns, causing increases in delinquencies and default rates, which could impact Cat Financials write-offs and provision for credit losses. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  The process Cat Financial uses to estimate losses inherent in its credit exposure requires a high degree of managements judgment regarding numerous subjective qualitative factors, including forecasts of economic conditions and how economic predictors might impair the ability of its borrowers to repay their loans. Financial market disruption and volatility may impact the accuracy of these judgments. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  Cat Financials ability to engage in routine funding transactions or borrow from other financial institutions on acceptable terms or at all could be adversely affected by disruptions in the capital markets or other events, including actions by rating agencies and deteriorating investor expectations. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  As Cat Financials lending agreements are primarily with financial institutions, their ability to perform in accordance with any of its underlying agreements could be adversely affected by market volatility and/or disruptions in financial markets. ##TABLE_END Changes in interest rates or market liquidity conditions could adversely affect Cat Financial's and our earnings and/or cash flow. Changes in interest rates and market liquidity conditions could have an adverse impact on Cat Financial's and our earnings and cash flows. Because a significant number of the loans made by Cat Financial are made at fixed interest rates, its business results are subject to fluctuations in interest rates. Certain loans made by Cat Financial and financing extended to Cat Financial are made at variable rates that use LIBOR as a benchmark for establishing the interest rate. LIBOR is the subject of recent proposals for reform. On July 27, 2017, the United Kingdoms Financial Conduct Authority announced that it intends to stop persuading or compelling banks to submit LIBOR rates after 2021. These reforms may cause LIBOR to cease to exist, new methods of calculating LIBOR to be established or the establishment of an alternative reference rate(s). These consequences cannot be entirely predicted and could have an adverse impact on the market value for or value of LIBOR-linked securities, loans, and other financial obligations or extensions of credit held by or due to Cat Financial. Changes in market interest rates may influence Cat Financials financing costs, returns on financial investments and the valuation of derivative contracts and could reduce its and our earnings and cash flows. Cat Financial manages interest rate and market liquidity risks through a variety of techniques that include a match funding program, the selective use of derivatives and a broadly diversified funding program. There can be no assurance, however, that fluctuations in interest rates and market liquidity conditions will not have an adverse impact on its and our earnings and cash flows. If any of the variety of instruments and strategies Cat Financial uses to hedge its exposure to these types of risk is ineffective, we may have an adverse impact on our earnings and cash flows. With respect to Insurance Services' investment activities, changes in the equity and bond markets could result in a decline in value of its investment portfolio, resulting in an unfavorable impact to earnings. An increase in delinquencies, repossessions or net losses of Cat Financial customers could adversely affect its results.  Inherent in the operation of Cat Financial is the credit risk associated with its customers. The creditworthiness of each customer and the rate of delinquencies, repossessions and net losses on customer obligations are directly impacted by several factors, including relevant industry and economic conditions, the availability of capital, the experience and expertise of the customer's management team, commodity prices, political events and the sustained value of the underlying collateral. Any increase in delinquencies, repossessions and net losses on customer obligations could have a material adverse effect on Cat Financial's and our earnings and cash flows. In addition, although Cat Financial evaluates and adjusts its allowance for credit losses related to past due and non-performing receivables on a regular basis, adverse economic conditions or other factors that might cause deterioration of the financial health of its customers could change the timing and level of payments received and necessitate an increase in Cat Financial's estimated losses, which could also have a material adverse effect on Cat Financial's and our earnings and cash flows. Currency exchange rate fluctuations affect our results of operations.  We conduct operations in many countries involving transactions denominated in a variety of currencies. We are subject to currency exchange rate risk to the extent that our costs are denominated in currencies other than those in which we earn revenues. Fluctuations in currency exchange rates have had, and will continue to have, an impact on our results as expressed in U.S. dollars. There can be no assurance that currency exchange rate fluctuations will not adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. While the use of currency hedging instruments may provide us with protection from adverse fluctuations in currency exchange rates, by utilizing these instruments we potentially forego the benefits that might result from favorable fluctuations in currency exchange rates. In addition, our outlooks do not assume fluctuations in currency exchange rates. Adverse fluctuations in currency exchange rates from the date of our outlooks could cause our actual results to differ materially from those anticipated in our outlooks and adversely impact our business, results of operations and financial condition.  We also face risks arising from the imposition of exchange controls and currency devaluations. Exchange controls may limit our ability to convert foreign currencies into U.S. dollars or to remit dividends and other payments by our foreign subsidiaries or businesses located in or conducted within a country imposing controls. Currency devaluations result in a diminished value of funds denominated in the currency of the country instituting the devaluation.  Restrictive covenants in our debt agreements could limit our financial and operating flexibility.  We maintain a number of credit facilities to support general corporate purposes (facilities) and have issued debt securities to manage liquidity and fund operations (debt securities). The agreements relating to a number of the facilities and the debt securities contain certain restrictive covenants applicable to us and certain subsidiaries, including Cat Financial. These covenants include maintaining a minimum consolidated net worth (defined as the consolidated shareholders equity including preferred stock but excluding the pension and other post-retirement benefits balance within accumulated other comprehensive income (loss)), limitations on the incurrence of liens and certain restrictions on consolidation and merger. Cat Financial has also agreed under certain of these agreements not to exceed a certain leverage ratio (consolidated debt to consolidated net worth, calculated (1) on a monthly basis as the average of the leverage ratios determined on the last day of each of the six preceding calendar months and (2) at each December 31), to maintain a minimum interest coverage ratio (profit excluding income taxes, interest expense and net gain/(loss) from interest rate derivatives to interest expense, calculated at the end of each calendar quarter for the rolling four quarter period then most recently ended) and not to terminate, amend or modify its support agreement with us.  A breach of one or more of the covenants could result in adverse consequences that could negatively impact our business, results of operations and financial condition. These consequences may include the acceleration of amounts outstanding under certain of the facilities, triggering of an obligation to redeem certain debt securities, termination of existing unused commitments by our lenders, refusal by our lenders to extend further credit under one or more of the facilities or to enter into new facilities or the lowering or modification of our credit ratings or those of one or more of our subsidiaries.  Sustained increases in funding obligations under our pension plans may impair our liquidity or financial condition.  We maintain certain defined benefit pension plans for our employees, which impose on us certain funding obligations. In determining our future payment obligations under the plans, we assume certain rates of return on the plan assets and a certain level of future benefit payments. Significant adverse changes in credit or capital markets could result in actual rates of return being materially lower than projected and result in increased contribution requirements. Our assumptions for future benefit payments may also change over time and could be materially higher than originally projected. We are expecting to make contributions to our pension plans in the future, and may be required to make contributions that could be material. We may fund contributions through the use of cash on hand, the proceeds of borrowings, shares of our common stock or a combination of the foregoing, as permitted by applicable law. Our assumptions for future benefit payments may also be materially higher than projected. These factors could significantly increase our payment obligations under the plans, and as a result, adversely affect our business and overall financial condition. LEGAL  REGULATORY RISKS Our global operations are subject to extensive trade and anti-corruption laws and regulations.  Due to the international scope of our operations, we are subject to a complex system of import- and export-related laws and regulations, including U.S. regulations issued by Customs and Border Protection, the Bureau of Industry and Security, the Office of Antiboycott Compliance, the Directorate of Defense Trade Controls and the Office of Foreign Assets Control, as well as the counterparts of these agencies in other countries. Any alleged or actual violations may subject us to government scrutiny, investigation and civil and criminal penalties, and may limit our ability to import or export our products or to provide services outside the United States. Furthermore, embargoes and sanctions imposed by the U.S. and other governments restricting or prohibiting sales to specific persons or countries or based on product classification may expose us to potential criminal and civil sanctions. We cannot predict the nature, scope or effect of future regulatory requirements to which our operations might be subject or in certain locations the manner in which existing laws might be administered or interpreted.  In addition, the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and similar foreign anti-corruption laws generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments or providing anything of value to improperly influence foreign government officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business, or obtaining an unfair advantage. Recent years have seen a substantial increase in the global enforcement of anti-corruption laws. Our operations outside the United States, including in developing countries, could increase the risk of such violations. Violations of anti-corruption laws or regulations by our employees, by intermediaries acting on our behalf, or by our joint venture partners may result in severe criminal or civil sanctions, could disrupt our business, and result in an adverse effect on our reputation, business and results of operations or financial condition. International trade policies may impact demand for our products and our competitive position.  Government policies on international trade and investment such as import quotas, capital controls or tariffs, whether adopted by individual governments or addressed by regional trade blocs, can affect the demand for our products and services, impact the competitive position of our products or prevent us from being able to sell products in certain countries. The implementation of more restrictive trade policies, such as more detailed inspections, higher tariffs or new barriers to entry, in countries where we sell large quantities of products and services could negatively impact our business, results of operations and financial condition. For example, a governments adoption of buy national policies or retaliation by another government against such policies could have a negative impact on our results of operations. We may incur additional tax expense or become subject to additional tax exposure.  We are subject to income taxes in the United States and numerous other jurisdictions. Our future results of operations could be adversely affected by changes in the effective tax rate as a result of a change in the mix of earnings between U.S. and non-U.S. jurisdictions or among jurisdictions with differing statutory tax rates, changes in our overall profitability, changes in tax laws or treaties or in their application or interpretation, changes in tax rates, changes in generally accepted accounting principles, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, changes in the amount of earnings indefinitely reinvested in certain non-U.S. jurisdictions, the results of audits and examinations of previously filed tax returns and continuing assessments of our tax exposures. We are also subject to the continuous examination of our income tax returns by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities. We regularly assess the likelihood of an adverse outcome resulting from these examinations. If our effective tax rates were to increase, or if the ultimate determination of our taxes owed is for an amount in excess of amounts previously accrued, our operating results, cash flows and financial condition could be adversely affected. For information regarding additional legal matters related to our taxes, please see Note 6  \"Income taxes\" and Note 22  \"Environmental and legal matters\" of Part II, Item 8 \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\" to this Annual Report on Form 10-K . Costs associated with lawsuits or investigations or adverse rulings in enforcement or other legal proceedings may have an adverse effect on our results of operations.  We are subject to a variety of legal proceedings and legal compliance risks in virtually every part of the world. We face risk of exposure to various types of claims, lawsuits and government investigations. We are involved in various claims and lawsuits related to product design, manufacture and performance liability (including claimed asbestos and welding fumes exposure), contracts, employment issues, environmental matters, intellectual property rights, tax, securities and other legal proceedings that arise in and outside of the ordinary course of our business. The industries in which we operate are also periodically reviewed or investigated by regulators, which could lead to enforcement actions, fines and penalties or the assertion of private litigation claims. It is not possible to predict with certainty the outcome of claims, investigations and lawsuits, and we could in the future incur judgments, fines or penalties or enter into settlements of lawsuits and claims that could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition in any particular period. The global and diverse nature of our operations means that legal and compliance risks will continue to exist and additional legal proceedings and other contingencies, the outcome of which cannot be predicted with certainty, may arise from time to time. In addition, subsequent developments in legal proceedings may affect our assessment and estimates of loss contingencies recorded as a reserve and require us to make payments in excess of our reserves, which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. New regulations or changes in financial services regulation could adversely impact Caterpillar and Cat Financial.  Cat Financials operations are highly regulated by governmental authorities in the locations where it operates, which can impose significant additional costs and/or restrictions on its business. In the U.S., for example, certain Cat Financial activities are subject to the U.S. Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Dodd-Frank), which includes extensive provisions regulating the financial services industry. Certain aspects of Dodd-Frank remain to be implemented under the rulemaking and regulatory authority of the SEC, the CFTC and federal banking regulators. As such, Cat Financial has become and could continue to become subject to additional regulatory costs that could be significant  and have an adverse effect on Cat Financial's and our results of operations and financial condition. Changes in regulations or additional regulations in the U.S. or internationally impacting the financial services industry could also add significant cost or operational constraints that might have an adverse effect on Cat Financial's and our results of operations and financial condition. We are subject to stringent environmental laws and regulations that impose significant compliance costs.  Our facilities, operations and products are subject to increasingly stringent environmental laws and regulations globally, including laws and regulations governing emissions to noise, air, releases to soil and discharges to water and the generation, handling, storage, transportation, treatment and disposal of non-hazardous and hazardous waste materials. Some environmental laws impose strict, retroactive and joint and several liability for the remediation of the release of hazardous substances, even for conduct that was lawful at the time it occurred, or for the conduct of, or conditions caused by, prior operators, predecessors or other third parties. Failure to comply with environmental laws could expose us to penalties or clean-up costs, civil or criminal liability and sanctions on certain of our activities, as well as damage to property or natural resources. The potential liabilities, sanctions, damages and remediation efforts related to any non-compliance with such laws and regulations could negatively impact our ability to conduct our operations and our financial condition and results of operations. In addition, there can be no assurances that we will not be adversely affected by costs, liabilities or claims with respect to existing or subsequently acquired operations or under present laws and regulations or those that may be adopted or imposed in the future. Environmental laws and regulations may change from time to time, as may related interpretations and other guidance. Changes in environmental laws or regulations could result in higher expenses and payments, and uncertainty relating to environmental laws or regulations may also affect how we conduct our operations and structure our investments and could limit our ability to enforce our rights. Changes in environmental and climate change laws or regulations, including laws relating to greenhouse gas emissions, could lead to new or additional investment in product designs and could increase environmental compliance expenditures. Changes in climate change concerns, or in the regulation of such concerns, including greenhouse gas emissions, could subject us to additional costs and restrictions, including increased energy and raw materials costs. If environmental laws or regulations are either changed or adopted and impose significant operational restrictions and compliance requirements upon us or our products, they could negatively impact our business, capital expenditures, results of operations, financial condition and competitive position. ##TABLE_START ", "1B": " Item 1B.

Risk Factors of the 2018 Form 10-K. OVERVIEW Our sales and revenues for 2018 were $54.722 billion, a 20 percent increase from 2017 sales and revenues of $45.462 billion. The increase was primarily due to higher sales volume , mostly due to improved demand across all regions and across the three primary segments. Profit per share for 2018 was $10.26, compared to profit per share of $1.26 in 2017. Profit was $6.147 billion in 2018, compared with $754 million in 2017. The increase was primarily due to lower tax expense, higher sales volume, decreased restructuring costs and improved price realization . The increase was partially offset by higher manufacturing costs and selling, general and administrative (SGA) and research and development (RD) expenses and lower profit from the Financial Products Segment . Fourth-quarter 2018 sales and revenues were $14.342 billion, up $1.446 billion, or 11 percent, from $12.896 billion in the fourth quarter of 2017. Fourth-quarter 2018 profit was $1.78 per share, compared with a loss of $2.18 per share in the fourth quarter of 2017. Fourth-quarter 2018 profit was $1.048 billion, compared with a loss of $1.299 billion in 2017. Highlights for 2018 include: ##TABLE_START  Sales and revenues in 2018 were $54.722 billion, up 20 percent from 2017. Sales improved in all regions and across the three primary segments. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Operating profit as a percent of sales and revenues was 15.2 percent in 2018, compared with 9.8 percent in 2017. Adjusted operating profit margin was 15.9 percent in 2018, compared with 12.5 percent in 2017. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Profit was $10.26 per share for 2018, and excluding the items in the table below, adjusted profit per share was $11.22. For 2017 profit was $1.26 per share, and excluding the items in the table below, adjusted profit per share was $6.88. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  In order for our results to be more meaningful to our readers, we have separately quantified the impact of several significant items: ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  Full Year 2018  Full Year 2017  (Millions of dollars) Profit Before Taxes  Profit Per Share  Profit Before Taxes  Profit Per Share  Profit $ 7,822  $ 10.26  $ 4,082  $ 1.26  Restructuring costs  0.50  1,256  1.68  Mark-to-market losses  0.64   0.26  Deferred tax valuation allowance adjustments   (0.01 )    (0.18 )  U.S. tax reform impact   (0.17 )    3.95  Gain on sale of equity investment     (85 )  (0.09 )  Adjusted profit $ 8,703  $ 11.22  $ 5,554  $ 6.88            ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Machinery, Energy  Transportation (MET) operating cash flow for 2018 was about $6.3 billion, more than sufficient to cover capital expenditures and dividends. MET operating cash flow for 2017 was about $5.5 billion. ##TABLE_END Restructuring Costs In recent years, we have incurred substantial restructuring costs to achieve a flexible and competitive cost structure. During 2018, we incurred $386 million of restructuring costs related to restructuring actions across the company. During 2017, we incurred $1.256 billion of restructuring costs with about half related to the closure of the facility in Gosselies, Belgium, and the remainder related to other restructuring actions across the company. Although we expect restructuring to continue as part of ongoing business activities, restructuring costs should be lower in 2019 than 2018.

Items favorably impacting sales and revenues appear as upward stair steps with the corresponding dollar amounts above each bar, while items negatively impacting sales and revenues appear as downward stair steps with dollar amounts reflected in parentheses above each bar. Caterpillar management utilizes these charts internally to visually communicate with the company's Board of Directors and employees. Total sales and revenues were $54.722 billion in 2018, an increase of $9.260 billion, or 20 percent, compared with $45.462 billion in 2017. The increase was primarily due to higher sales volume driven by improved demand for equipment across the three primary segments, including favorable changes in dealer inventories. Favorable price realization across the three primary segments also contributed to the sales improvement. In addition, sales were higher due to currency impacts, primarily from a stronger euro. Financial Products revenues increased slightly. Sales increased in all regions, with the largest sales increase in North America, which improved 23 percent as strong economic conditions in key end markets drove higher demand. Also contributing to higher sales was an increase in dealer inventories during 2018, compared with dealer inventories that were about flat in 2017. Sales increased 13 percent in Latin America primarily due to stabilizing economic conditions in several countries in the region that resulted in improved demand from low levels. EAME sales increased 16 percent primarily due to higher demand, including favorable changes in dealer inventories. The improvement in demand was primarily in Europe. The impact of a stronger euro and favorable price realization also contributed to higher sales. The impact of changes in dealer inventories was favorable as dealer inventories increased more significantly in 2018 than in 2017. Asia/Pacific sales increased 28 percent primarily due to higher demand in several countries across the region, including favorable changes in dealer inventories and favorable price realization. Dealer inventories increased during 2018 as compared with dealer inventories that were about flat in 2017. Dealer machine and engine inventories increased about $2.3 billion in 2018, compared with an increase of about $100 million in 2017. Dealers are independent, and the reasons for changes in their inventory levels vary, including their expectations of future demand and product delivery times. Dealers demand expectations take into account seasonal changes, macroeconomic conditions, machine rental rates and other factors. Delivery times can vary based on availability of product from Caterpillar factories and product distribution centers. ##TABLE_START Sales and Revenues by Segment (Millions of dollars)   Sales Volume  Price Realization  Currency  Inter-Segment / Other   $ Change  % Change Construction Industries  $ 19,240  $ 3,663  $  $  $  $ 23,237  $ 3,997  % Resource Industries  7,861  2,082   (14 )   10,270  2,409  % Energy  Transportation  19,382  2,637     22,785  3,403  % All Other Segments   (26 )  (1 )   (64 )   (88 )  (15 )% Corporate Items and Eliminations  (4,377 )  (65 )   (1 )  (510 )  (4,952 )  (575 )   Machinery, Energy  Transportation  42,676  8,291      51,822  9,146  %                  Financial Products Segment  3,093         3,279   % Corporate Items and Eliminations  (307 )        (72 )  (379 )  (72 )   Financial Products Revenues  2,786         2,900   %                  Consolidated Sales and Revenues  $ 45,462  $ 8,291  $  $  $  $ 54,722  $ 9,260  %                  ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START Sales and Revenues by Geographic Region  North America  Latin America  EAME  Asia/Pacific  External Sales and Revenues  Inter-Segment  Total Sales and Revenues (Millions of dollars) $  % Chg  $  % Chg  $  % Chg  $  % Chg  $  % Chg  $  % Chg  $  % Chg                            Construction Industries $ 10,754  23%  $ 1,479  6%  $ 4,410  17%  $ 6,473  24%  $ 23,116  21%  $  13%  $ 23,237  21% Resource Industries 3,357  30%  1,647  29%  2,217  25%  2,667  43%  9,888  32%   7%  10,270  31% Energy  Transportation 9,685  22%  1,331  6%  4,934  11%  2,882  25%  18,832  18%  3,953  16%  22,785  18% All Other Segments  (10%)   %   (67%)   37%   (13%)   (16%)   (15%) Corporate Items and Eliminations (155 )        (11 )    (2 )    (168 )    (4,784 )    (4,952 )   Machinery, Energy  Transportation 23,704  23%  4,460  13%  11,568  16%  12,090  28%  51,822  21%    %  51,822  21%                             Financial Products Segment 2,153  7%   (8%)   (7%)   26%  3,279  6%    %  3,279  6% Corporate Items and Eliminations (234 )    (46 )    (26 )    (73 )    (379 )        (379 )   Financial Products Revenues 1,919  6%   (10%)   (10%)   24%  2,900  4%    %  2,900  4%                             Consolidated Sales and Revenues $ 25,623  22%  $ 4,695  12%  $ 11,929  15%  $ 12,475  28%  $ 54,722  20%  $   %  $ 54,722  20%                                                        Construction Industries $ 8,742    $ 1,396    $ 3,760    $ 5,235    $ 19,133    $    $ 19,240   Resource Industries 2,582    1,281    1,775    1,866    7,504       7,861   Energy  Transportation 7,959    1,261    4,431    2,313    15,964    3,418    19,382   All Other Segments                     Corporate Items and Eliminations (97 )    (1 )    (6 )       (103 )    (4,274 )    (4,377 )   Machinery, Energy  Transportation 19,256    3,940    10,014    9,466    42,676        42,676                               Financial Products Segment 2,006             3,093        3,093   Corporate Items and Eliminations (190 )    (46 )    (19 )    (52 )    (307 )        (307 )   Financial Products Revenues 1,816             2,786        2,786                               Consolidated Sales and Revenues $ 21,072    $ 4,200    $ 10,413    $ 9,777    $ 45,462    $     $ 45,462                               ##TABLE_ENDCONSOLIDATED OPERATING PROFIT The chart above graphically illustrates reasons for the change in Consolidated Operating Profit between 2017 (at left) and 2018 (at right). Items favorably impacting operating profit  appear as upward stair steps with the corresponding dollar amounts above each bar, while items negatively impacting operating profit appear as downward stair steps with dollar amounts reflected in parentheses above each bar. Caterpillar management utilizes these charts internally to visually communicate with the company's Board of Directors and employees. The bar entitled Other includes consolidating adjustments and Machinery, Energy  Transportation other operating (income) expenses . Operating profit was $8.293 billion in 2018, an increase of $3.833 billion, or 86 percent, compared with $4.460 billion in 2017. The increase was primarily due to higher sales volume and lower restructuring costs. Higher manufacturing costs and increased SGA/RD expenses were mostly offset by favorable price realization. Manufacturing costs were higher due to increased material and freight costs, partially offset by lower warranty expense. Material costs were higher primarily due to increases in steel prices. The impact of recently imposed tariffs on material costs was about $110 million during 2018. We expect higher expense in 2019 due to the full-year impact of tariffs. Freight costs were unfavorable primarily due to supply chain inefficiencies as the industry responds to strong global demand. SGA/RD expenses increased primarily due to investments aligned with the companys strategic growth initiatives. Restructuring costs were $394 million in 2018, related to restructuring actions across the company. In 2017, we incurred $1.227 billion of restructuring costs with about half related to the closure of the facility in Gosselies, Belgium, and the remainder related to other restructuring actions across the company. Short-term incentive compensation expense is directly related to financial and operational performance, measured against targets set annually. Short-term incentive compensation expense in 2018 was about $1.4 billion, nearly the same as 2017. For 2019, we expect short-term incentive compensation expense will be significantly lower than 2018. We also expect favorable price realization to about offset higher costs, excluding short-term incentive compensation expense. ##TABLE_START Profit (Loss) by Segment         (Millions of dollars)    $ Change  % Change Construction Industries  $ 4,174  $ 3,255  $  % Resource Industries  1,603    % Energy  Transportation  3,938  2,856  1,082  % All Other Segments   (44 )   % Corporate Items and Eliminations  (1,583 )  (2,659 )  1,076   Machinery, Energy  Transportation  8,155  4,106  4,049  %          Financial Products Segment    (287 )  (36 )% Corporate Items and Eliminations   (116 )    Financial Products    (154 )  (23 )% Consolidating Adjustments  (384 )  (322 )  (62 )   Consolidated Operating Profit  $ 8,293  $ 4,460  $ 3,833  %          ##TABLE_ENDOther Profit/Loss Items ##TABLE_START  Other income/expense in 2018 was expense of $67 million, compared with income of $153 million in 2017. The unfavorable change was primarily a result of an unfavorable impact from equity securities in Insurance Services. Effective January 1, 2018, we adopted a new U.S. GAAP accounting rule that requires our equity securities to be measured at fair value through earnings. Previously, the fair value adjustments for these securities were reported in equity until the securities were sold or an impairment was recognized. We adopted the standard using the modified retrospective approach, with no change to prior year financial statements. During 2018, we recognized a loss of $33 million related to fair value adjustments. During 2017, we recognized gains on sales of securities of $104 million. In addition, the absence of a 2017 pretax gain of $85 million on the sale of Caterpillars equity investment in IronPlanet contributed to the unfavorable change. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  The provision for income taxes for 2018 reflects an annual effective tax rate of 24.1 percent, compared with 27.7 percent for the full year of 2017, excluding the items discussed below. The decrease was primarily due to the reduction in the U.S. corporate tax rate beginning January 1, 2018, along with other changes in the geographic mix of profits from a tax perspective. ##TABLE_END We have completed our accounting for the income tax effects of U.S. tax reform legislation and included measurement period adjustments in 2018 of $104 million to reduce the provisionally estimated charge of $2.371 billion recognized in 2017. A $154 million benefit revised the estimated impact of the write-down of U.S. net deferred tax assets to reflect the reduction in the U.S. corporate tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent. This benefit primarily related to the decision to make an additional discretionary pension contribution of $1.0 billion to U.S. pension plans in 2018 which was treated as deductible on the 2017 U.S. tax return. A $50 million charge revised the provisionally estimated cost of a mandatory deemed repatriation of non-U.S. earnings, including changes in the deferred tax liability related to the amount of earnings considered not indefinitely reinvested as well as the amount of unrecognized tax benefits and state tax liabilities associated with these tax positions. The provision for income taxes in 2018 and 2017 also included non-cash benefits of $63 million and $111 million, respectively, from reductions in the valuation allowance against U.S. state deferred tax assets due to improved profits in the United States. An additional benefit of $25 million was included in 2018 due to the release of a valuation allowance for a certain non-U.S. subsidiary. The provision for income taxes in 2018 also included a charge of $59 million to correct for an error which resulted in an understatement of the valuation allowance offsetting deferred tax assets for prior years. This error had the effect of overstating profit by $17 million and $33 million for 2017 and 2016, respectively. Management has concluded that the error was not material to any period presented. In addition, a tax benefit of $56 million was recorded in 2018, compared with $64 million in 2017, for the settlement of stock-based compensation awards with associated tax deductions in excess of cumulative U.S. GAAP compensation expense. We expect the annual effective tax rate will be higher in 2019. The anticipated increase primarily relates to the application of U.S. tax reform provisions to earnings of non-U.S. subsidiaries which do not have a calendar fiscal year end. Certain provisions did not apply to these subsidiaries in 2018. Construction Industries Construction Industries total sales were $23.237 billion in 2018, compared with $19.240 billion in 2017. The increase was mostly due to higher sales volume for construction equipment. Sales were also higher due to currency impacts, primarily from a stronger euro. ##TABLE_START  Sales volume increased primarily due to higher demand for construction equipment and the impact of favorable changes in dealer inventories. Dealer inventories increased significantly more during 2018 than during 2017. ##TABLE_END Sales increased in all regions. ##TABLE_START  In North America, the sales increase was primarily due to higher demand for construction equipment, primarily to support oil and gas activities, including pipelines, non-residential building construction and infrastructure activities. In addition, sales increased due to the favorable impact of dealer inventories, which increased during 2018, compared with a slight decrease during 2017. We believe the strength of the U.S. economy, continued pipeline construction and state and local funding for infrastructure development will be favorable to sales in 2019. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Although construction activities remained weak in Latin America, sales were higher in the region. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Sales increased in EAME primarily due to higher demand and the favorable impact of currency, mostly from a stronger euro. Higher demand was driven by increased construction activities across several countries in the region. Favorable price realization also contributed to the sales increase. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Sales in Asia/Pacific were higher in several countries in the region, most significantly in China, stemming from increased building construction and infrastructure investment. Favorable changes in dealer inventories contributed to the sales improvement as dealer inventories increased in 2018 and were about flat in 2017. In 2019, we expect demand in China to be about flat after two years of significant growth. ##TABLE_END Construction Industries profit was $4.174 billion in 2018, compared with $3.255 billion in 2017. The increase in profit was a result of higher sales volume and favorable price realization, partially offset by higher material and freight costs, and increased SGA/RD expenses, partially due to spending for strategic growth initiatives. Construction Industries profit as a percent of total sales was 18.0 percent in 2018, compared with 16.9 percent in 2017. Resource Industries Resource Industries total sales were $10.270 billion in 2018, an increase of $2.409 billion from 2017. The increase was primarily due to higher demand for both mining and heavy construction equipment, including aftermarket parts. Favorable commodity price levels and increased mining production contributed to higher mining equipment sales. In addition, increased sales to heavy construction, quarry and aggregate customers were driven by positive global economic growth. Resource Industries customers globally continue to focus on improving productivity and efficiency of existing machine assets, thereby extending equipment life cycles and lowering operating costs. Rebuild, overhaul and maintenance activity was robust, resulting in higher aftermarket parts sales. Favorable price realization also contributed to the sales improvement. In 2019, we believe commodity market fundamentals will remain supportive for investment and mining companies will increase their capital expenditures. We expect demand for heavy construction, quarry and aggregate equipment will remain strong in 2019. Resource Industries profit was $1.603 billion in 2018, compared with $698 million in 2017. The improvement was mostly due to higher sales volume and favorable price realization, partially offset by increased manufacturing costs and unfavorable currency impacts. Manufacturing costs were unfavorable as lower warranty expense was more than offset by higher freight and material costs. Resource Industries profit as a percent of total sales was 15.6 percent in 2018, compared with 8.9 percent in 2017.

The increase was primarily due to higher sales volume across all applications. Favorable price realization also contributed to the increase in sales. ##TABLE_START  Oil and Gas - Sales increased due to higher demand in North America for well servicing and gas compression applications. Growth in U.S. onshore oil and gas drove increased sales for reciprocating engines and related aftermarket parts. Sales of turbines and turbine-related services were higher for production applications. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Power Generation - Sales improved across all regions, with the largest increase in North America, primarily for reciprocating engine applications including data centers, and for aftermarket parts. In addition, sales increased in EAME from reciprocating engine projects, turbines and turbine-related services and favorable currency. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Industrial - Sales were higher in Asia/Pacific and North America, primarily due to improving economic conditions supporting higher engine sales into industrial applications. Sales in EAME were about flat as economic uncertainty in a few countries in the Middle East was mostly offset by favorable currency impacts. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Transportation - Sales were higher for rail services driven by acquisitions in Asia/Pacific and EAME and increased rail traffic in North America. Marine sales were higher in Asia/Pacific, led by increased activity in the ferry sector. ##TABLE_END Energy  Transportations profit was $3.938 billion in 2018, compared with $2.856 billion in 2017. The improvement was due to higher sales volume and favorable price realization. This was partially offset due to increased spending for strategic growth initiatives and higher freight costs. Energy  Transportations profit as a percent of total sales was 17.3 percent in 2018, compared with 14.7 percent in 2017. Financial Products Segment Financial Products segment revenues were $3.279 billion, an increase of $186 million, or 6 percent, from 2017. The increase was primarily due to higher average financing rates and higher average earning assets in North America and Asia/Pacific. These favorable impacts were partially offset by lower intercompany lending activity in North America, lower average earning assets in Latin America and lower average financing rates in Europe. Financial Products segment profit was $505 million in 2018, compared with $792 million in 2017. The decrease was primarily due to an increase in the provision for credit losses at Cat Financial, an unfavorable impact from equity securities in Insurance Services and lower intercompany lending activity. These unfavorable impacts, which are not expected to recur in 2019, were partially offset by higher average earning assets and an increase in net yield on average earning assets. At the end of 2018, past dues at Cat Financial were 3.55 percent, compared with 2.78 percent at the end of 2017. Write-offs, net of recoveries, were $189 million for 2018, compared with $114 million for 2017. As of December 31, 2018, Cat Financial's allowance for credit losses totaled $511 million, or 1.80 percent of finance receivables, compared with $365 million, or 1.33 percent of finance receivables at December 31, 2017. The increase in past dues, write-offs and allowance for credit losses was primarily due to weakening in the Cat Power Finance portfolio. Corporate Items and Eliminations Expense for corporate items and eliminations was $1.566 billion in 2018, a decrease of $1.209 billion from 2017. The decrease in expense was mostly due to lower restructuring costs and methodology differences. Restructuring costs were $394 million in 2018. In 2017, restructuring costs impacting operating profit were $1.227 billion with about half related to the closure of the facility in Gosselies, Belgium and the remainder related to other restructuring actions across the company. FOURTH QUARTER 2018 COMPARED WITH FOURTH QUARTER 2017  CONSOLIDATED SALES AND REVENUES The chart above graphically illustrates reasons for the change in Consolidated Sales and Revenues between the fourth quarter of 2017 (at left) and the fourth quarter of 2018 (at right). Items favorably impacting sales and revenues appear as upward stair steps with the corresponding dollar amounts above each bar, while items negatively impacting sales and revenues appear as downward stair steps with dollar amounts reflected in parentheses above each bar. Caterpillar management utilizes these charts internally to visually communicate with the company's Board of Directors and employees. Total sales and revenues were $14.342 billion in the fourth quarter of 2018, an increase of $1.446 billion, or 11 percent, compared with $12.896 billion in the fourth quarter of 2017. The increase was due to higher sales volume driven by improved demand across all regions and in the three primary segments. Favorable price realization, primarily in Construction Industries, also contributed to the sales improvement. The increase was partially offset by unfavorable currency impacts due to a stronger U.S. dollar. Sales increased in all regions. The largest sales increase was in North America, which improved 13 percent as strong economic conditions in key end markets drove higher demand, including favorable changes in dealer inventories. Dealer inventories increased more significantly during the fourth quarter of 2018 than during the fourth quarter of 2017. Sales increased 11 percent in Latin America primarily due to stabilizing economic conditions in several countries in the region that resulted in improved demand from low levels. EAME sales increased 14 percent primarily due to higher demand as economic conditions improved in Europe; however, this was partially offset by economic uncertainty in a few countries in the Middle East. Asia/Pacific sales increased 7 percent mostly due to higher demand, including favorable changes in dealer inventories, in several countries across the region. This was partially offset by lower demand in China following two years of significant growth. Dealer inventories increased during the fourth quarter of 2018 and were about flat during the fourth quarter of 2017. Favorable price realization also contributed to the sales improvement. The increase in sales was partially offset by unfavorable currency impacts. Dealer machine and engine inventories increased about $200 million during the fourth quarter of 2018 and remained about flat during the fourth quarter of 2017. Dealers are independent, and the reasons for changes in their inventory levels vary, including their expectations of future demand and product delivery times. Dealers demand expectations take into account seasonal changes, macroeconomic conditions, machine rental rates and other factors. Delivery times can vary based on availability of product from Caterpillar factories and product distribution centers. ##TABLE_START Sales and Revenues by Segment (Millions of dollars)  Fourth Quarter 2017  Sales Volume  Price Realization  Currency  Inter-Segment / Other  Fourth Quarter 2018  $ Change  % Change Construction Industries  $ 5,295  $  $  $ (85 )  $  $ 5,705  $  % Resource Industries  2,308    (32 )  (17 )  2,797   % Energy  Transportation  5,640    (73 )   6,287   % All Other Segments   (13 )      (13 )   (26 )  (17 )% Corporate Items and Eliminations  (1,204 )  (25 )     (60 )  (1,288 )  (84 )   Machinery, Energy  Transportation  12,194  1,447   (190 )    13,630  1,436  %                  Financial Products Segment            % Corporate Items and Eliminations  (81 )        (19 )  (100 )  (19 )   Financial Products Revenues            %                  Consolidated Sales and Revenues  $ 12,896  $ 1,447  $  $ (190 )  $  $ 14,342  $ 1,446  %                  ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START Sales and Revenues by Geographic Region  North America  Latin America  EAME  Asia/Pacific  External Sales and Revenues  Inter-Segment  Total Sales and Revenues (Millions of dollars) $  % Chg  $  % Chg  $  % Chg  $  % Chg  $  % Chg  $  % Chg  $  % Chg Fourth Quarter 2018                            Construction Industries $ 2,749  17%  $  (5%)  $ 1,063  9%  $ 1,480  (4%)  $ 5,666  8%  $  5%  $ 5,705  8% Resource Industries  15%   21%   17%   41%  2,711  23%   (17%)  2,797  21% Energy  Transportation 2,569  10%   16%  1,509  17%   5%  5,265  12%  1,022  9%  6,287  11% All Other Segments  (27%)   100%   (57%)   %   (25%)   (13%)   (17%) Corporate Items and Eliminations (47 )       (3 )    (2 )    (51 )    (1,237 )    (1,288 )   Machinery, Energy  Transportation 6,193  13%  1,277  11%  3,129  14%  3,031  7%  13,630  12%    %  13,630  12%                             Financial Products Segment  8%   (15%)   (21%)   26%   4%    %   4% Corporate Items and Eliminations (66 )    (10 )    (8 )    (16 )    (100 )        (100 )   Financial Products Revenues  5%   (15%)   (25%)   27%   1%    %   1%                             Consolidated Sales and Revenues $ 6,672  13%  $ 1,335  10%  $ 3,205  12%  $ 3,130  8%  $ 14,342  11%  $   %  $ 14,342  11%                             Fourth Quarter 2017                            Construction Industries $ 2,346    $    $    $ 1,544    $ 5,258    $    $ 5,295   Resource Industries             2,205       2,308   Energy  Transportation 2,327       1,286       4,706       5,640   All Other Segments                     Corporate Items and Eliminations (27 )                (27 )    (1,177 )    (1,204 )   Machinery, Energy  Transportation 5,459    1,151    2,751    2,833    12,194        12,194                               Financial Products Segment                      Corporate Items and Eliminations (50 )    (12 )    (6 )    (13 )    (81 )        (81 )   Financial Products Revenues                                                  Consolidated Sales and Revenues $ 5,914    $ 1,219    $ 2,852    $ 2,911    $ 12,896    $     $ 12,896                               ##TABLE_ENDCONSOLIDATED OPERATING PROFIT The chart above graphically illustrates reasons for the change in Consolidated Operating Profit between the fourth quarter of 2017 (at left) and the fourth quarter of 2018 (at right). Items favorably impacting operating profit  appear as upward stair steps with the corresponding dollar amounts above each bar, while items negatively impacting operating profit appear as downward stair steps with dollar amounts reflected in parentheses above each bar. Caterpillar management utilizes these charts internally to visually communicate with the company's Board of Directors and employees. The bar entitled Other includes consolidating adjustments and Machinery, Energy  Transportation other operating (income) expenses. Operating profit for the fourth quarter of 2018 was $1.883 billion, compared with $1.387 billion in the fourth quarter of 2017. The increase of $496 million was mostly due to higher sales volume. Favorable price realization and lower restructuring costs were mostly offset by higher manufacturing costs and lower profit from Financial Products. Manufacturing costs were higher due to increased material and freight costs, partially offset by lower warranty expense. Material costs were higher primarily due to increases in steel prices and tariffs. Freight costs were unfavorable primarily due to continued supply chain inefficiencies. Financial Products operating profit was lower primarily due to an increase in the provision for credit losses, which was mostly driven by a $72 million unfavorable impact from an increase in allowance rate and an increase in write-offs of $13 million, due to continued weakening in the Cat Power Finance portfolio. This was partially offset by higher average earning assets. Restructuring costs were $101 million in the fourth quarter of 2018, compared with $245 million in the fourth quarter of 2017. Short-term incentive compensation expense was about $310 million in the fourth quarter of 2018, compared with about $350 million in the fourth quarter of 2017. Operating profit margin for the fourth quarter of 2018 was 13.1 percent, compared with 10.8 percent in the fourth quarter of 2017. ##TABLE_START Profit (Loss) by Segment         (Millions of dollars)  Fourth Quarter 2018  Fourth Quarter 2017  $ Change  % Change Construction Industries  $  $  $  % Resource Industries     % Energy  Transportation  1,079    % All Other Segments  (47 )  (16 )  (31 )  (194 )% Corporate Items and Eliminations  (375 )  (588 )    Machinery, Energy  Transportation  1,902  1,317   %          Financial Products Segment    (204 )  (88 )% Corporate Items and Eliminations   (77 )    Financial Products    (73 )  (47 )% Consolidating Adjustments  (102 )  (86 )  (16 )   Consolidated Operating Profit  $ 1,883  $ 1,387  $  %          ##TABLE_ENDOther Profit/Loss Items ##TABLE_START  Interest expense excluding Financial Products in the fourth quarter of 2018 was $99 million, a decrease of $70 million primarily due to an early debt retirement in the fourth quarter of 2017. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Other income/expense in the fourth quarter of 2018 was a loss of $417 million, compared with a loss of $107 million in the fourth quarter of 2017. The unfavorable change was primarily a result of an increase in mark-to-market losses related to pension and other postemployment benefit (OPEB) plans and an unfavorable impact from equity securities. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  The provision for income taxes in the fourth quarter of 2018 reflects an annual effective tax rate of 24.1 percent, compared with 27.7 percent for the full year of 2017, excluding the items discussed below. The decrease was primarily due to the reduction in the U.S. corporate tax rate beginning January 1, 2018, along with other changes in the geographic mix of profits from a tax perspective. ##TABLE_END The provision for income taxes in the fourth quarter of 2018 and 2017 also included non-cash benefits of $63 million and $111 million, respectively, from reductions in the valuation allowance against U.S. state deferred tax assets due to improved profits in the United States. The provision for income taxes in the fourth quarter of 2018 also included a $50 million increase related to the $2.371 billion charge recorded in the fourth quarter of 2017 due to the enactment of U.S. tax reform legislation. In addition, a tax benefit of $4 million was recorded in the fourth quarter of 2018, compared with $19 million in the fourth quarter of 2017, for the settlement of stock-based compensation awards with associated tax deductions in excess of cumulative U.S. GAAP compensation expense. The provision for income taxes in the fourth quarter of 2018 and 2017 also included a $8 million charge and a $130 million benefit, respectively, related to the change from the third-quarter estimated annual tax rate. Construction Industries Construction Industries total sales were $5.705 billion in the fourth quarter of 2018, compared with $5.295 billion in the fourth quarter of 2017. The increase was mostly due to higher sales volume for construction equipment. Favorable price realization was mostly offset by unfavorable currency impacts due to a stronger U.S. dollar. ##TABLE_START  In North America, the sales increase was driven by higher demand for new equipment, with about half due to an increase in dealer inventories. The increase in demand was primarily to support oil and gas activities, including pipelines, and non-residential building construction activities. Favorable price realization also contributed to the sales improvement. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Construction activities remained at low levels in Latin America. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Sales increased in EAME as infrastructure, road and non-residential building construction activities drove higher demand in Europe, partially offset by weakness in the Middle East. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Sales in Asia/Pacific declined due to lower demand in China, partially offset by higher demand in a few other countries in the region. Unfavorable currency impacts also contributed to the sales decline. ##TABLE_END Construction Industries profit was $845 million in the fourth quarter of 2018, compared with $837 million in the fourth quarter of 2017. The increase in profit was a result of favorable price realization and higher sales volume, mostly offset by higher manufacturing costs, including material, freight, labor costs and the absence of Brazil incentives. Construction Industries profit as a percent of total sales was 14.8 percent in the fourth quarter of 2018, compared with 15.8 percent in the fourth quarter of 2017. Resource Industries Resource Industries total sales were $2.797 billion in the fourth quarter of 2018, an increase of $489 million from the fourth quarter of 2017. The increase was primarily due to higher demand for both mining and heavy construction equipment, including quarry and aggregate. Mining activities were robust as commodity market fundamentals remained positive, and increased non-residential construction activities drove higher sales. Resource Industries profit was $400 million in the fourth quarter of 2018, compared with $210 million in the fourth quarter of 2017. The improvement was mostly due to higher sales volume and favorable price realization, partially offset by higher material and freight costs. Resource Industries profit as a percent of total sales was 14.3 percent in the fourth quarter of 2018, compared with 9.1 percent in the fourth quarter of 2017.

The increase was primarily due to higher sales volume across all applications except Industrial, which was flat. ##TABLE_START  Oil and Gas - Sales increased due to higher demand for reciprocating engines in North America for gas compression and well servicing applications. Sales of turbines and turbine-related services were about flat. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Power Generation - Sales improved across all regions, with the largest increases in North America and EAME primarily for reciprocating engine applications, including data centers and other large power generation projects. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Industrial - Sales were flat, with increases in Asia/Pacific and North America about offset by lower sales in EAME and Latin America. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Transportation - Sales were higher primarily due to rail services, driven by acquisitions. ##TABLE_END Energy  Transportations profit was $1.079 billion in the fourth quarter of 2018, compared with $874 million in the fourth quarter of 2017. The improvement was mostly due to higher sales volume. The increase was partially offset by higher manufacturing costs, including freight costs. Energy  Transportations profit as a percent of total sales was 17.2 percent in the fourth quarter of 2018, compared with 15.5 percent in the fourth quarter of 2017. Financial Products Segment Financial Products segment revenues were $812 million in the fourth quarter of 2018, an increase of $29 million, or 4 percent, from the fourth quarter of 2017. The increase was primarily due to higher average financing rates and higher average earning assets in North America and Asia/Pacific. These favorable impacts were partially offset by an unfavorable impact from returned or repossessed equipment in Europe and Latin America. Financial Products segment profit was $29 million in the fourth quarter of 2018, compared with $233 million in the fourth quarter of 2017. About half of the decrease was due to an unfavorable impact from equity securities in Insurance Services, which was driven by the absence of investment gains from the fourth quarter of 2017 and an unfavorable impact from mark-to-market in the fourth quarter of 2018. In addition, an increase in the provision for credit losses at Cat Financial also contributed to lower profit. This increase was driven by a higher allowance rate and an increase in write-offs, due to continued weakening in the Cat Power Finance portfolio. Corporate Items and Eliminations Expense for corporate items and eliminations was $321 million in the fourth quarter of 2018, a decrease of $344 million from the fourth quarter of 2017, primarily due to methodology differences and lower restructuring costs. Restructuring costs were $101 million in the fourth quarter of 2018, compared with $245 million in the fourth quarter of 2017. 2017 COMPARED WITH 2016  CONSOLIDATED SALES AND REVENUES The chart above graphically illustrates reasons for the change in Consolidated Sales and Revenues between 2016 (at left) and 2017 (at right). Items favorably impacting sales and revenues appear as upward stair steps with the corresponding dollar amounts above each bar, while items negatively impacting sales and revenues appear as downward stair steps with dollar amounts reflected in parentheses above each bar. Caterpillar management utilizes these charts internally to visually communicate with the company's board of directors and employees. Total sales and revenues were $45.462 billion in 2017, an increase of $6.925 billion, or 18 percent, compared with $38.537 billion in 2016. The increase was primarily due to higher sales volume, mostly due to improved end-user demand. In addition, favorable changes in dealer inventories contributed to increased sales volume. The improvement in end-user demand was across all regions and most end markets. The favorable change in dealer inventories was primarily due to a decrease in 2016, compared with dealer inventories that were about flat in 2017. Dealer machine and engine inventories increased about $100 million in 2017, compared with a decrease of about $1.6 billion during 2016. Dealers are independent, and the reasons for changes in their inventory levels vary, including their expectations of future demand and product delivery times. Dealers demand expectations take into account seasonal changes, macroeconomic conditions, machine rental rates and other factors. Delivery times can vary based on availability of product from Caterpillar factories and product distribution centers. By segment, the largest sales volume increase was in Construction Industries mostly due to higher end-user demand for construction equipment. Resource Industries sales volume increased due to higher end-user demand for aftermarket parts and equipment and a favorable impact of changes in dealer inventories. Energy  Transportations sales volume was higher mostly due to increased demand for equipment and aftermarket parts for oil and gas and industrial applications. Favorable price realization, mostly in Construction Industries, also contributed to the sales improvement. Financial Products revenues were about flat. Sales increased in all regions. In North America, sales increased 19 percent primarily due to higher end-user demand mostly for on-shore oil and gas applications and construction equipment, the favorable impact of changes in dealer inventories and favorable price realization, primarily in Construction Industries. Asia/Pacific sales increased 23 percent primarily due to an increase in construction equipment sales, mostly in China resulting from increased building construction and infrastructure investment. EAME sales increased 16 percent primarily due to higher end-user demand for equipment and aftermarket parts in Resource Industries and favorable changes in dealer inventories, as dealers decreased inventories in 2016 and inventories were about flat in 2017. In addition, price realization was favorable, primarily in Construction Industries. Sales increased 25 percent in Latin America primarily due to stabilizing economic conditions in several countries in the region that resulted in improved end-user demand from low levels and the favorable impact of changes in dealer inventories as inventories decreased in 2016 and increased in 2017. ##TABLE_START Sales and Revenues by Segment (Millions of dollars)   Sales Volume  Price Realization  Currency  Inter-Segment / Other   $ Change  % Change Construction Industries  $ 15,690  $ 2,810  $  $ (40 )  $  $ 19,240  $ 3,550  % Resource Industries  6,010  1,638     7,861  1,851  % Energy  Transportation  16,951  1,556  (42 )    19,382  2,431  % All Other Segments        (13 )    % Corporate Items and Eliminations  (3,422 )       (967 )  (4,377 )  (955 )   Machinery, Energy  Transportation  35,773  6,055      42,676  6,903  %                  Financial Products Segment  2,993         3,093   % Corporate Items and Eliminations  (229 )        (78 )  (307 )  (78 )   Financial Products Revenues  2,764         2,786   %                  Consolidated Sales and Revenues  $ 38,537  $ 6,055  $  $  $  $ 45,462  $ 6,925  %                  ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START Sales and Revenues by Geographic Region  North America  Latin America  EAME  Asia/Pacific  External Sales and Revenues  Inter-Segment  Total Sales and Revenues (Millions of dollars) $  % Chg  $  % Chg  $  % Chg  $  % Chg  $  % Chg  $  % Chg  $  % Chg                            Construction Industries $ 8,742  16%  $ 1,396  32%  $ 3,760  15%  $ 5,235  39%  $ 19,133  23%  $  37%  $ 19,240  23% Resource Industries 2,582  25%  1,281  28%  1,775  51%  1,866  26%  7,504  31%   26%  7,861  31% Energy  Transportation 7,959  19%  1,261  14%  4,431  5%  2,313  (5%)  15,964  11%  3,418  35%  19,382  14% All Other Segments  52%   %   93%   (18%)   28%   (3%)   5% Corporate Items and Eliminations (97 )    (1 )    (6 )       (103 )    (4,274 )    (4,377 )   Machinery, Energy  Transportation 19,256  19%  3,940  25%  10,014  16%  9,466  23%  42,676  19%    %  42,676  19%                             Financial Products Segment 2,006  8%   (9%)   4%   (8%)  3,093  3%    %  3,093  3% Corporate Items and Eliminations (190 )    (46 )    (19 )    (52 )    (307 )        (307 )   Financial Products Revenues 1,816  5%   (11%)   4%   (12%)  2,786  1%    %  2,786  1%                             Consolidated Sales and Revenues $ 21,072  17%  $ 4,200  22%  $ 10,413  15%  $ 9,777  21%  $ 45,462  18%  $   %  $ 45,462  18%                                                        Construction Industries $ 7,529    $ 1,059    $ 3,270    $ 3,754    $ 15,612    $    $ 15,690   Resource Industries 2,068    1,001    1,179    1,478    5,726       6,010   Energy  Transportation 6,680    1,104    4,201    2,426    14,411    2,540    16,951   All Other Segments                     Corporate Items and Eliminations (98 )    (3 )    (9 )    (5 )    (115 )    (3,307 )    (3,422 )   Machinery, Energy  Transportation 16,225    3,164    8,669    7,715    35,773        35,773                               Financial Products Segment 1,862             2,993        2,993   Corporate Items and Eliminations (125 )    (45 )    (17 )    (42 )    (229 )        (229 )   Financial Products Revenues 1,737             2,764        2,764                               Consolidated Sales and Revenues $ 17,962    $ 3,455    $ 9,053    $ 8,067    $ 38,537    $     $ 38,537                               ##TABLE_ENDCONSOLIDATED OPERATING PROFIT The chart above graphically illustrates reasons for the change in Consolidated Operating Profit between 2016 (at left) and 2017 (at right). Items favorably impacting operating profit appear as upward stair steps with the corresponding dollar amounts above each bar, while items negatively impacting operating profit appear as downward stair steps with dollar amounts reflected in parentheses above each bar. Caterpillar management utilizes these charts internally to visually communicate with the company's Board of Directors and employees. The bar entitled Other includes consolidating adjustments and Machinery, Energy  Transportation other operating (income) expenses. Operating profit for 2017 was $4.460 billion, compared with $1.162 billion in 2016. The increase of $3.298 billion was primarily due to higher sales volume, improved price realization and the absence of a goodwill impairment charge in Resource Industries in 2016. An increase in SGA/RD expenses and restructuring costs was partially offset by lower manufacturing costs. SGA/RD expenses increased primarily due to higher short-term incentive compensation expense, partially offset by the favorable impact of restructuring and cost reduction actions. These actions primarily impacted research and development (RD) expenses. Short-term incentive compensation expense is directly related to financial and operational performance, measured against targets set annually. Short-term incentive compensation expense was about $1.4 billion in 2017, significantly above targeted levels, compared with about $250 million in 2016. In 2017, we incurred $1.227 billion of restructuring costs with about half related to the closure of the facility in Gosselies, Belgium, and the remainder related to other restructuring actions across the company. In 2016, restructuring costs were $1.012 billion, primarily related to Resource Industries and Energy  Transportation. Manufacturing costs were lower primarily due to the favorable impact from cost absorption and efficiencies, partially offset by higher short-term incentive compensation expense. Cost absorption was favorable as inventory increased in 2017, and decreased in 2016. Material costs were slightly unfavorable in 2017, as higher steel costs were partially offset by cost reduction actions. ##TABLE_START Profit (Loss) by Segment         (Millions of dollars)    $ Change  % Change Construction Industries  $ 3,255  $ 1,639  $ 1,616  % Resource Industries   (1,045 )  1,743  n/a Energy  Transportation  2,856  2,187   % All Other Segments  (44 )  (85 )   % Corporate Items and Eliminations  (2,659 )  (1,943 )  (716 )   Machinery, Energy  Transportation  4,106   3,353  %          Financial Products Segment     % Corporate Items and Eliminations  (116 )  (53 )  (63 )   Financial Products     % Consolidating Adjustments  (322 )  (240 )  (82 )   Consolidated Operating Profit  $ 4,460  $ 1,162  $ 3,298  %          ##TABLE_ENDOther Profit/Loss Items ##TABLE_START  Other income/expense in 2017 was income of $153 million, compared with a loss of $518 million in 2016. The improvement was primarily due to a decrease in mark-to-market losses related to pension and OPEB plans, a pretax gain on the sale of Caterpillar's equity investment in IronPlanet, gains on sale of securities and an increase in interest income. The favorable change was partially offset by an unfavorable net impact from currency translation and hedging gains and losses. Currency translation and hedging net losses in 2017 were significantly higher than the net losses in 2016. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  The provision for income taxes for 2017 reflects an annual effective tax rate of 27.7 percent, compared with 36.4 percent for the full-year 2016, excluding the items discussed below. The effective tax rate related to 2017 full-year adjusted profit before tax, excluding a discrete benefit from stock-based compensation awards, was 27 percent, compared with 26 percent in 2016. ##TABLE_END The provision for income taxes for 2017 also included a charge of $2.371 billion due to the enactment of U.S. tax reform legislation on December 22, 2017. The provisionally estimated charge included a $596 million write-down of net deferred tax assets to reflect the reduction in the U.S. corporate tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent beginning January 1, 2018, with the remainder primarily related to the cost of a mandatory deemed repatriation of non-U.S. earnings. The 2017 provision for income taxes also included the following: ##TABLE_START  A non-cash benefit of $111 million, net of U.S. federal tax at 35 percent, from reductions in the valuation allowance against U.S. state deferred tax assets due to improved profits in the United States. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  A tax benefit of $64 million for the settlement of stock-based compensation awards with associated tax deductions in excess of cumulative U.S. GAAP compensation expense. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  A charge of $15 million for an increase in prior year taxes related to the Gosselies, Belgium, facility restructuring costs. ##TABLE_END The provision for income taxes for 2016 also included a non-cash charge of $141 million, net of U.S. federal tax at 35 percent, for increases in the valuation allowance against U.S. state deferred tax assets. Construction Industries Construction Industries total sales were $19.240 billion in 2017, compared with $15.690 billion in 2016. The increase was due to higher sales volume and favorable price realization. ##TABLE_START  Sales volume increased due to higher end-user demand, primarily for equipment in Asia/Pacific and North America. In addition, sales volume increased due to favorable changes in dealer inventories, as inventories decreased in 2016 and increased in 2017. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Although market conditions remained competitive, price realization was favorable due to a particularly weak pricing environment in 2016, and previously implemented price increases impacting 2017. ##TABLE_END Sales increased across all regions with the largest increases in Asia/Pacific and North America. ##TABLE_START  Sales in Asia/Pacific were higher as a result of an increase in end-user demand, primarily in China, stemming from increased building construction and infrastructure investment. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  In North America, sales increased primarily due to higher end-user demand for construction equipment, mostly due to improved oil and gas, residential and nonresidential construction activities. Also contributing to higher sales was the impact of favorable changes in dealer inventories, as inventories decreased more in 2016 than in 2017, and favorable price realization. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Sales in EAME increased due to favorable changes in dealer inventories and favorable price realization. The favorable impact of change in dealer inventories resulted from a decrease in 2016 and an increase in 2017. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Although construction activity remained weak in Latin America, sales were higher as end-user demand increased from low levels due to stabilizing economic conditions in several countries in the region. In addition, sales volume increased due to favorable changes in dealer inventories, as dealer inventories increased in 2017 and decreased in 2016. ##TABLE_END Construction Industries profit was $3.255 billion in 2017, compared with $1.639 billion in 2016. The increase in profit was primarily due to higher sales volume and favorable price realization. SGA/RD expenses were unfavorable primarily due to higher short-term incentive compensation expense. Construction Industries profit as a percent of total sales was 16.9 percent in 2017, compared with 10.4 percent in 2016. Resource Industries Resource Industries total sales were $7.861 billion in 2017, an increase of $1.851 billion, or 31 percent, from 2016. Sales increased due to higher end-user demand for aftermarket parts and equipment and the favorable impact of changes in dealer inventories. Positive commodity price trends in 2017 drove improved market conditions and better financial health of mining companies. After a number of years of low investment, miners began to increase capital expenditures in 2017, reflecting more confidence in their end markets. Idle mining trucks on customer sites also decreased in 2017. These changes resulted in higher sales for aftermarket parts to support increased mining activity as well as maintenance and rebuild activities and, by the second half of 2017, resulted in higher end-user demand for mining equipment. Dealer inventories increased in 2017, compared with a significant decrease in 2016. Resource Industries profit was $698 million in 2017, compared with a loss of $1.045 billion in 2016. The improvement was partially due to the absence of a goodwill impairment charge of $595 million in 2016. Higher sales volume, lower manufacturing costs and favorable price realization also contributed to increased profit. Manufacturing costs were lower primarily due to a favorable impact from cost absorption, lower period manufacturing costs and efficiencies. Cost absorption was favorable as inventory increased in 2017, to support higher production volumes and decreased in 2016. Period manufacturing costs were lower primarily due to the favorable impact of restructuring and cost reduction actions, partially offset by an increase in short-term incentive compensation expense. Resource Industries profit as a percent of total sales was 8.9 percent in 2017, compared with a loss as a percent of total sales of 17.4 percent in 2016. Energy  Transportation Energy  Transportations total sales were $19.382 billion in 2017, compared with $16.951 billion in 2016. The increase was primarily due to higher sales in oil and gas and industrial applications. ##TABLE_START  Oil and Gas - Sales increased in North America due to higher sales of reciprocating engines and aftermarket parts used in on-shore gas compression and well servicing applications. Sales in remaining regions were about flat. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Industrial - Sales were higher in all regions, reflecting increased sales for equipment across end-user applications and aftermarket parts. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Transportation - Sales were higher primarily in North America for rail services driven by increased rail traffic. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Power Generation - Sales were about flat in all regions as the industry remains challenged. ##TABLE_END Energy  Transportations profit was $2.856 billion in 2017, compared with $2.187 billion in 2016. The increase was primarily due to higher sales volume, partially offset by higher SGA/RD expenses and manufacturing costs. The increase in SGA/RD expenses was primarily due to higher short-term incentive compensation expense. Manufacturing costs were higher primarily due to higher short-term incentive compensation expense, partially offset by favorable impact from cost absorption and improved material costs. Cost absorption was favorable as inventory increased in 2017, compared with a decrease in 2016. Energy  Transportations profit as a percent of total sales was 14.7 percent in 2017, compared with 12.9 percent in 2016. Financial Products Segment Financial Products segment revenues were $3.093 billion, an increase of $100 million, or 3 percent, from 2016. The increase was primarily due to higher average financing rates in North America, a favorable impact from intercompany lending activity in North America and higher average earning assets in EAME. These favorable impacts were partially offset by lower average financing rates in Asia/Pacific and lower average earning assets in North America and Latin America. Financial Products segment profit was $792 million in 2017, compared with $702 million in 2016. The increase was primarily due to higher gains on sales of securities at Insurance Services, an increase in net yield on average earning assets and increased intercompany lending activity. These favorable impacts were partially offset by an increase in SGA expenses due to higher short-term incentive compensation expense. At the end of 2017, past dues at Cat Financial were 2.78 percent, compared with 2.38 percent at the end of 2016. Write-offs, net of recoveries, were $114 million for the full year of 2017, compared with $123 million for the full year of 2016. As of December 31, 2017, Cat Financial's allowance for credit losses totaled $365 million, or 1.33 percent of finance receivables, compared with $343 million, or 1.29 percent of finance receivables at year-end 2016. Corporate Items and Eliminations Expense for corporate items and eliminations was $2.775 billion in 2017, which was an increase of $779 million compared with 2016. The increase in expense was a result of higher restructuring costs, methodology differences, timing differences and an increase in short-term incentive compensation expense. RESTRUCTURING COSTS Restructuring costs for 2018, 2017 and 2016 were as follows: ##TABLE_START        (Millions of dollars)    Employee separations 1  $  $  $ Contract terminations 1    Long-lived asset impairments 1    Defined benefit plan curtailments and termination benefits 2  (8 )   Other 3    Total restructuring costs  $  $ 1,256  $ 1,019        1 Recognized in Other operating (income) expenses.       2 Recognized in Other income (expense).       3 Represents costs related to our restructuring programs, primarily for accelerated depreciation, project management costs, equipment relocation and inventory write-downs, and also LIFO inventory decrement benefits from inventory liquidations at closed facilities, all of which are primarily included in Cost of goods sold.        ##TABLE_ENDThe restructuring costs in 2018 were primarily related to ongoing facility closures across the company. In 2017, about half of the restructuring costs were related to the closure of the facility in Gosselies, Belgium, within Construction Industries, and the remainder was related to other restructuring actions across the company. The restructuring costs in 2016 were primarily related to actions in Resource Industries in response to continued weakness in the mining industry. In addition, costs in 2016 resulted from our decision to discontinue production of on-highway vocational trucks within Energy  Transportation and other restructuring actions across the company. Restructuring costs are a reconciling item between Segment profit and Consolidated profit before taxes. The following table summarizes the 2017 and 2018 employee separation activity: ##TABLE_START   (Millions of dollars)  Liability balance at December 31, 2016 $ Increase in liability (separation charges) Reduction in liability (payments) (423 ) Liability balance at December 31, 2017 $ Increase in liability (separation charges) Reduction in liability (payments) (276 ) Liability balance at December 31, 2018 $   ##TABLE_END Most of the remaining liability balance as of December 31, 2018 is expected to be paid in 2019. In March 2017, Caterpillar informed Belgian authorities of the decision to proceed to a collective dismissal, which led to the closure of the Gosselies site, impacting about 2,000 employees. Production of Caterpillar products at the Gosselies site ended during the second quarter of 2017. The other operations and functions at the Gosselies site were phased out by the end of the second quarter of 2018. The program concluded in 2018, and we incurred a total of $647 million of restructuring costs (primarily in 2017) under this program. These costs were primarily related to employee separation costs, long-lived asset impairments and other costs which were partially offset by a LIFO inventory decrement benefit. Restructuring costs for the year ended December 31, 2016 were $1,019 million. Throughout 2016, we initiated the following restructuring plans: ##TABLE_START  In February 2016, we made the decision to discontinue production of on-highway vocational trucks. Based on the business climate in the truck industry and a thorough evaluation of the business, the company decided it would withdraw from this market. We recognized $104 million of restructuring costs, primarily related to long-lived asset impairments and sales discounts. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  In the second half of 2016, we took additional restructuring actions in Resource Industries, including ending the production of track drills; pursuing strategic alternatives related to room and pillar products; consolidation of two product development divisions; and additional actions in response to ongoing weakness in the mining industry. For the year ended December 31, 2016, we incurred $369 million of restructuring costs for these plans primarily related to long-lived asset impairments, employee separation costs and inventory write-downs. ##TABLE_END In September 2015, we announced a large scale restructuring plan (the Plan) including a voluntary retirement enhancement program for qualifying U.S. employees, several voluntary separation programs outside of the U.S., additional involuntary programs throughout the company and manufacturing facility consolidations and closures that occurred through 2018. The largest action among those included in the Plan was related to our European manufacturing footprint which led to the Gosselies, Belgium, facility closure as discussed above. We incurred $121 million, $817 million and $281 million of restructuring costs associated with these actions in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Total restructuring costs incurred since the inception of the Plan were $1,788 million. The remaining costs of approximately $50 million related to the Plan are expected to be recognized in 2019. Although we expect restructuring to continue as part of ongoing business activities, restructuring costs are anticipated to be lower in 2019 than 2018. We are expecting about $300 million of cost reduction in 2019 from lower operating costs, primarily SGA expenses and Cost of goods sold primarily resulting from 2018 restructuring actions.

Funding for these businesses is also available from commercial paper and long-term debt issuances. Financial Products' operations are funded primarily from commercial paper, term debt issuances and collections from its existing portfolio. During 2018, we experienced favorable liquidity conditions globally in both our MET and Financial Products' operations. On a consolidated basis, we ended 2018 with $7.86 billion of cash, a decrease of $404 million from year-end 2017. We intend to maintain a strong cash and liquidity position. Our cash balances are held in numerous locations throughout the world with approximately $6.9 billion held by our non-U.S. subsidiaries. As a result of U.S. tax reform legislation enacted in December 2017, we expect to be able to use cash held by non-U.S. subsidiaries in the United States in the future with minimal tax consequences.  Consolidated operating cash flow for 2018 was $6.56 billion, up from $5.71 billion in 2017. The increase was due to higher profit in 2018 adjusted for non-cash items. Profit in 2017 included a non-cash charge related to U.S. tax reform legislation enacted in December 2017. The most significant driver of higher profit was an increase in sales volume in 2018. This improvement was mostly offset by higher working capital requirements to support increasing production volumes and higher short-term incentive compensation payments. See further discussion of operating cash flow under MET and Financial Products. Total debt as of December 31, 2018 was $36.55 billion, an increase of $1.68 billion from year-end 2017. Debt related to Financial Products increased $1.60 billion, primarily due to increased portfolio funding requirements. Debt related to MET increased $79 million in 2018. During 2018, we repurchased $3.80 billion of Caterpillar common stock.  We have three global credit facilities with a syndicate of banks totaling $10.50 billion (Credit Facility) available in the aggregate to both Caterpillar and Cat Financial for general liquidity purposes. Based on management's allocation decision, which can be revised from time to time, the portion of the Credit Facility available to MET as of December 31, 2018 was $2.75 billion. Information on our Credit Facility is as follows: ##TABLE_START  The 364-day facility of $3.15 billion (of which $0.82 billion is available to MET) expires in September 2019. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  The three-year facility, as amended in September 2018, of $2.73 billion (of which $0.72 billion is available to MET) expires in September 2021. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  The five-year facility, as amended in September 2018, of $4.62 billion (of which $1.21 billion is available to MET) expires in September 2023. ##TABLE_END At December 31, 2018, Caterpillar's consolidated net worth was $14.07 billion, which was above the $9.00 billion required under the Credit Facility. The consolidated net worth is defined as the consolidated shareholder's equity including preferred stock but excluding the pension and other postretirement benefits balance within Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). At December 31, 2018, Cat Financial's covenant interest coverage ratio was 1.56 to 1. This is above the 1.15 to 1 minimum ratio, calculated as (1) profit excluding income taxes, interest expense and net gain/(loss) from interest rate derivatives to (2) interest expense calculated at the end of each calendar quarter for the rolling four quarter period then most recently ended, required by the Credit Facility. In addition, at December 31, 2018, Cat Financial's six-month covenant leverage ratio was 7.69 to 1 and year-end covenant leverage ratio was 8.33 to 1. This is below the maximum ratio of debt to net worth of 10 to 1, calculated (1) on a monthly basis as the average of the leverage ratios determined on the last day of each of the six preceding calendar months and (2) at each December 31, required by the Credit Facility. In the event Caterpillar or Cat Financial does not meet one or more of their respective financial covenants under the Credit Facility in the future (and are unable to obtain a consent or waiver), the syndicate of banks may terminate the commitments allocated to the party that does not meet its covenants. Additionally, in such event, certain of Cat Financial's other lenders under other loan agreements where similar financial covenants or cross default provisions are applicable, may, at their election, choose to pursue remedies under those loan agreements, including accelerating the repayment of outstanding borrowings. At December 31, 2018, there were no borrowings under the Credit Facility. Our total credit commitments and available credit as of December 31, 2018 were: ##TABLE_START          December 31, 2018 (Millions of dollars)  Consolidated  Machinery, Energy  Transportation  Financial Products Credit lines available:       Global credit facilities  $ 10,500  $ 2,750  $ 7,750 Other external  4,577    4,577 Total credit lines available  15,077  2,750  12,327 Less: Commercial paper outstanding  (4,759 )    (4,759 ) Less: Utilized credit  (1,172 )    (1,172 ) Available credit  $ 9,146  $ 2,750  $ 6,396        ##TABLE_END The other consolidated credit lines with banks as of December 31, 2018 totaled $4.58 billion. These committed and uncommitted credit lines, which may be eligible for renewal at various future dates or have no specified expiration date, are used primarily by our subsidiaries for local funding requirements. Caterpillar or Cat Financial may guarantee subsidiary borrowings under these lines.  We receive debt ratings from the major credit rating agencies. Moodys rates our debt as low-A, while Fitch and SP maintain a mid-A debt rating. This split rating has not had a material impact on our borrowing costs or our overall financial health. However, a downgrade of our credit ratings by any of the major credit rating agencies would result in increased borrowing costs and could make access to certain credit markets more difficult. In the event economic conditions deteriorate such that access to debt markets becomes unavailable, MET's operations would rely on cash flow from operations, use of existing cash balances, borrowings from Cat Financial and access to our Credit Facility. Our Financial Products' operations would rely on cash flow from its existing portfolio, existing cash balances, access to our Credit Facility and other credit line facilities of Cat Financial and potential borrowings from Caterpillar. In addition, we maintain a support agreement with Cat Financial, which requires Caterpillar to remain the sole owner of Cat Financial and may, under certain circumstances, require Caterpillar to make payments to Cat Financial should Cat Financial fail to maintain certain financial ratios. Machinery, Energy  Transportation  Net cash provided by operating activities was $6.35 billion in 2018, compared with $5.46 billion in 2017. The increase was primarily due to higher profit in 2018 adjusted for non-cash items. Profit in 2017 included a non-cash charge related to U.S. tax reform legislation enacted in December 2017. The most significant driver of higher profit was an increase in sales volume during 2018. This improvement was mostly offset by higher working capital requirements to support increasing production volumes and higher short-term incentive compensation payments. Within working capital, changes to accounts payable, inventories and customer advances unfavorably impacted cash flow, but were partially offset by changes to accounts receivable. Net cash used for investing activities in 2018 was $1.19 billion, compared with net cash used of $727 million in 2017. The change was primarily due to the acquisition of ECM S.p.A. and Downer Freight Rail in 2018 and increased capital expenditures. Net cash used for financing activities during 2018 was $5.47 billion, compared with net cash used of $2.58 billion in 2017. The change was primarily due to the repurchase of $3.80 billion of Caterpillar common stock in 2018, partially offset by lower payments on debt in 2018, as 2017 included the early retirement of $900 million of debt due in December 2018 and a long-term debt maturity of $500 million.  Our priorities for cash deployment have not changed. While our short-term priorities for the use of cash may vary from time to time as business needs and conditions dictate, our long-term cash deployment strategy is focused on the following priorities. Our top priority is to maintain a strong financial position in support of a Mid-A rating. Next, we intend to fund operational requirements and commitments. Then, we intend to fund priorities that profitably grow the company and return capital to shareholders through dividend growth and share repurchases. Additional information on cash deployment is as follows:  Strong financial position   Our top priority is to maintain a strong financial position in support of a Mid-A rating. We track a diverse group of financial metrics that focus on liquidity, leverage, cash flow and margins aligned with our cash deployment actions and the various methodologies used by the major credit rating agencies. Operational excellence and commitments   Capital expenditures were $1.22 billion during 2018, compared to $916 million in 2017. We expect MET's capital expenditures in 2019 to be about $1.4 billion. Contributions to our pension and OPEB plans were $1.35 billion and $1.61 billion in 2018 and 2017, respectively. Both years included a $1.0 billion discretionary contribution to our U.S. pension plans. We expect to make approximately $315 million of contributions to our pension and OPEB plans in 2019.  Fund strategic growth initiatives and return capital to shareholders   We intend to fund initiatives that drive long-term profitable growth that will be focused in the areas of expanded offerings and services, including acquisitions. In 2018, we acquired ECM S.p.A. and Downer Freight Rail. Each quarter, our Board of Directors reviews the company's dividend for the applicable quarter. The Board evaluates the financial condition of the company and considers the economic outlook, corporate cash flow, the company's liquidity needs, and the health and stability of global credit markets to determine whether to maintain or change the quarterly dividend. Dividends paid totaled $1.95 billion in 2018, representing 78 cents per share paid in the first and second quarter, and 86 cents per share paid in the third quarter and fourth quarter. In January 2014, the Board of Directors approved an authorization to repurchase up to $10 billion of Caterpillar common stock (the 2014 Authorization), which expired on December 31, 2018. As of January 1, 2018, $5.47 billion remained available under the 2014 Authorization, and in 2018, we repurchased $3.80 billion of Caterpillar common stock. In July 2018, the Board of Directors approved a new share repurchase authorization of up to $10 billion of Caterpillar common stock effective January 1, 2019, with no expiration. Our share repurchase plans are subject to the companys cash deployment priorities and are evaluated on an ongoing basis; however, we plan to consistently repurchase common stock with the intent to, at a minimum, offset the impact of dilution over time. The timing and amount of future repurchases may vary depending on operating cash flow, market conditions and investing priorities. Caterpillar's basic shares outstanding as of December 31, 2018 were approximately 576 million.  Financial Products  Financial Products operating cash flow was $1.52 billion in 2018, compared with $1.35 billion in 2017. Net cash used for investing activities was $2.78 billion in 2018, compared with $596 million in 2017. The change was primarily due to the impact of portfolio related activity. Net cash provided by financing activities in 2018 was $1.26 billion, compared with net cash used for financing activities of $1.82 billion in 2017. The change was primarily due to higher portfolio funding requirements and a lower dividend payment to Machinery, Energy  Transportation. Contractual obligations  The company has committed cash outflow related to long-term debt, operating lease agreements, postretirement benefit obligations, purchase obligations, interest on long-term debt and other long-term contractual obligations. As of December 31, 2018 , minimum payments for these obligations were:  ##TABLE_START (Millions of dollars)   2020-2021  2022-2023  After 2023  Total Long-term debt:           Machinery, Energy  Transportation (excluding capital leases)  $  $ 1,374  $  $ 6,189  $ 8,153 Machinery, Energy  Transportation-capital leases      Financial Products  5,823  11,330  4,224  1,490  22,867 Total long-term debt 1  5,833  12,767  4,828  7,711  31,139 Operating leases                 Postretirement benefit obligations 2    1,200  2,850  5,045 Purchase obligations:           Accounts payable 3  7,051        7,051 Purchase orders 4  6,451        6,451 Other contractual obligations 5        Total purchase obligations  13,769       13,810 Interest on long-term debt 6   1,399   5,792  8,990 Other long-term obligations 7       2,161 Total contractual obligations  $ 21,607  $ 15,971  $ 7,439  $ 16,900  $ 61,917 ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START 1  Amounts exclude unamortized discounts, a non-cash settlement for a capital lease, debt issuance costs, and fair value adjustments. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START 2  Amounts represent expected contributions to our pension and other postretirement benefit plans through 2028, offset by expected Medicare Part D subsidy receipts. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START 3  Amount represents invoices received and recorded as liabilities in 2018, but scheduled for payment in 2019. These represent short-term obligations made in the ordinary course of business. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START 4  Amount represents contractual obligations for material and services on order at December 31, 2018 but not yet delivered. These represent short-term obligations made in the ordinary course of business. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START 5  Amounts represent long-term commitments entered into with key suppliers for minimum purchases quantities. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START 6  Amounts represent estimated contractual interest payments on long-term debt, including capital lease interest payments. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START 7  Amounts represent contractual obligations primarily for logistics services agreements related to our former third party logistics business, software license and development contracts, IT consulting contracts and outsourcing contracts for benefit plan administration and software system support, and estimated income tax payments for mandatory deemed repatriation as a result of U.S. tax reform. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START      ##TABLE_ENDThe total amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits for uncertain tax positions, including positions impacting only the timing of tax benefits, was $1,796 million at December 31, 2018. Payment of these obligations would result from settlements with taxing authorities. Due to the difficulty in determining the timing of settlements, these obligations are not included in the table above. We do not expect to make a tax payment related to these obligations within the next year that would significantly impact liquidity. Off-balance sheet arrangements We are a party to certain off-balance sheet arrangements, primarily in the form of guarantees. Information related to guarantees appears in Note 21  Guarantees and product warranty of Part II, Item 8 Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES  The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts. The more significant estimates include: residual values for leased assets, fair values for goodwill impairment tests, warranty liability, stock-based compensation, reserves for product liability and insurance losses, postretirement benefits, post-sale discounts, credit losses and income taxes. We have incorporated many years of data into the determination of each of these estimates and we have not historically experienced significant adjustments. These assumptions are reviewed at least annually with the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors. Following are the methods and assumptions used in determining our estimates and an indication of the risks inherent in each.  Residual values for leased assets  The residual values for Cat Financials leased assets, which are an estimate of the market value of leased equipment at the end of the lease term, are based on an analysis of historical wholesale market sales prices, projected forward on a level trend line without consideration for inflation or possible future pricing action. At the inception of the lease, residual values are estimated with consideration of the following critical factors: market size and demand, any known significant market/product trends, total expected hours of usage, machine configuration, application, location, model changes, quantities, past remarketing experience, third-party residual guarantees and contractual customer purchase options. Many of these factors are gathered in an application survey that is completed prior to quotation. The lease agreement also clearly defines applicable return conditions and remedies for non-compliance, to ensure that the leased equipment will be in good operating condition upon return. Model changes and updates, as well as market strength and product acceptance, are monitored and adjustments are made to residual values in accordance with the significance of any such changes. Remarketing sales staff works closely with customers and dealers to manage the sale of lease returns and the recovery of residual exposure. During the term of the equipment on operating leases, we evaluate our depreciation on a regular basis taking into consideration expected residual values at lease termination. Adjustments to depreciation expense reflecting revised estimates of expected residual values at the end of the lease terms are recorded prospectively on a straight-line basis. For finance leases, residual value adjustments are recognized through a reduction of finance revenue. We evaluate the carrying value of equipment on operating leases for potential impairment when we determine a triggering event has occurred. When a triggering event occurs, a test for recoverability is performed by comparing projected undiscounted future cash flows to the carrying value of the equipment on operating leases. If the test for recoverability identifies a possible impairment, the fair value of the equipment on operating leases is measured in accordance with the fair value measurement framework. An impairment charge is recognized for the amount by which the carrying value of the equipment on operating leases exceeds its estimated fair value. At December 31, 2018, the aggregate residual value of equipment on operating leases was $2.21 billion. Without consideration of other factors such as third-party residual guarantees or contractual customer purchase options, a 10% non-temporary decrease in the market value of our equipment subject to operating leases would reduce residual value estimates and result in the recognition of approximately $80 million of additional annual depreciation expense. Fair values for goodwill impairment tests  We test goodwill for impairment annually, at the reporting unit level, and whenever events or circumstances make it more likely than not that an impairment may have occurred, such as a significant adverse change in the business climate or a decision to sell all or a portion of a reporting unit. We perform our annual goodwill impairment test as of October 1 and monitor for interim triggering events on an ongoing basis. Goodwill is reviewed for impairment utilizing either a qualitative assessment or a quantitative goodwill impairment test. If we choose to perform a qualitative assessment and determine the fair value more likely than not exceeds the carrying value, no further evaluation is necessary. For reporting units where we perform the quantitative goodwill impairment test, we compare the fair value of each reporting unit, which we primarily determine using an income approach based on the present value of discounted cash flows, to the respective carrying value, which includes goodwill. If the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying value, the goodwill is not considered impaired. Beginning in 2017, if the carrying value is higher than the fair value, the difference would be recognized as an impairment loss. Prior to 2017, a two-step process was used. For reporting units where we performed the two-step process, the first step required us to compare the fair value of each reporting unit, which we primarily determined using an income approach based on the present value of discounted cash flows, to the respective carrying value, which includes goodwill. If the fair value of the reporting unit exceeded its carrying value, the goodwill was not considered impaired. If the carrying value was higher than the fair value, there was an indication that an impairment may have existed and the second step was required. In step two, the implied fair value of goodwill was calculated as the excess of the fair value of a reporting unit over the fair values assigned to its assets and liabilities. If the implied fair value of goodwill was less than the carrying value of the reporting unit's goodwill, the difference was recognized as an impairment loss. The impairment test process requires valuation of the respective reporting unit, which we primarily determine using an income approach based on a discounted five year forecasted cash flow with a year-five residual value. The residual value is computed using the constant growth method, which values the forecasted cash flows in perpetuity. The income approach is supported by a reconciliation of our calculated fair value for Caterpillar to the company's market capitalization. The assumptions about future cash flows and growth rates are based on each reporting unit's long-term forecast and are subject to review and approval by senior management. A reporting units discount rate is a risk-adjusted weighted average cost of capital, which we believe approximates the rate from a market participant's perspective. The estimated fair value could be impacted by changes in market conditions, interest rates, growth rates, tax rates, costs, pricing and capital expenditures. The fair value determination is categorized as Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy due to its use of internal projections and unobservable measurement inputs. Our annual impairment tests completed in the fourth quarter of 2018 indicated the fair value of each reporting unit was substantially above its respective carrying value, including goodwill. Caterpillars market capitalization has remained significantly above the net book value of the Company. An unfavorable change in our expectations for the financial performance of our reporting units, particularly long-term growth and profitability, would reduce the fair value of our reporting units. The demand for our equipment and related parts is highly cyclical and significantly impacted by commodity prices, although the impact may vary by reporting unit. The energy and mining industries are major users of our products, including the coal, iron ore, gold, copper, oil and natural gas industries. Decisions to purchase our products are dependent upon the performance of those industries, which in turn are dependent in part on commodity prices. Lower commodity prices or industry specific circumstances that have a negative impact to the valuation assumptions may reduce the fair value of our reporting units. Should such events occur and it becomes more likely than not that a reporting unit's fair value has fallen below its carrying value, we will perform an interim goodwill impairment test(s), in addition to the annual impairment test. Future impairment tests may result in a goodwill impairment, depending on the outcome of the quantitative impairment test. A goodwill impairment would be reported as a non-cash charge to earnings.  Warranty liability  At the time a sale is recognized, we record estimated future warranty costs. The warranty liability is determined by applying historical claim rate experience to the current field population and dealer inventory. Generally, historical claim rates are based on actual warranty experience for each product by machine model/engine size by customer or dealer location (inside or outside North America). Specific rates are developed for each product shipment month and are updated monthly based on actual warranty claim experience. Warranty costs may differ from those estimated if actual claim rates are higher or lower than our historical rates.  Stock-based compensation  We use a lattice-based option-pricing model to calculate the fair value of our stock options and stock appreciation rights (SARs). The calculation of the fair value of the awards using the lattice-based option-pricing model is affected by our stock price on the date of grant as well as assumptions regarding the following:  ##TABLE_START  Volatility is a measure of the amount by which the stock price is expected to fluctuate each year during the expected term of the award and is based on historical Caterpillar stock price movement and current implied volatilities from traded options on Caterpillar stock. The implied volatilities from traded options are impacted by changes in market conditions. An increase in the volatility would result in an increase in our expense. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  The expected term represents the period of time that awards granted are expected to be outstanding and is an output of the lattice-based option-pricing model. In determining the expected term of the award, future exercise and forfeiture patterns are estimated from Caterpillar employee historical exercise behavior. These patterns are also affected by the vesting conditions of the award. Changes in the future exercise behavior of employees or in the vesting period of the award could result in a change in the expected term. An increase in the expected term would result in an increase to our expense. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  The weighted-average dividend yield is based on Caterpillars historical dividend yields. As holders of stock options and SARs do not receive dividend payments, this could result in employees retaining the award for a longer period of time if dividend yields decrease or exercising the award sooner if dividend yields increase. A decrease in the dividend yield would result in an increase in our expense. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  The risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at time of grant. As the risk-free interest rate increases, the expected term increases, resulting in an increase in our expense. ##TABLE_END  Beginning in 2018, the fair value of Restricted Stock Units (RSUs) and Performance-based Restricted Stock Units (PRSUs) is determined as the closing stock price on the date of grant, as holders of these awards are credited with dividend equivalent units on each date that a cash dividend is paid to holders of Common Stock. Prior to 2018, RSUs and PRSUs were not credited dividend equivalent units and the fair value was determined by reducing the stock price on the date of grant by the present value of the estimated dividends to be paid during the vesting period. The estimated dividends were based on Caterpillars quarterly dividend per share at the time of grant.  Stock-based compensation expense is recognized based on the grant date fair value. Forfeitures are accounted for in the period they occur as a reduction to expense. Stock-based compensation expense for PRSUs is based on the probable number of shares expected to vest. Changes in the expected probability of achieving performance targets in future periods may result in an increase or decrease in our expense.  Product liability and insurance loss reserve  We determine these reserves based upon reported claims in process of settlement and actuarial estimates for losses incurred but not reported. Loss reserves, including incurred but not reported reserves, are based on estimates and ultimate settlements may vary significantly from such estimates due to increased claims frequency or severity over historical levels.  Postretirement benefits  Primary actuarial assumptions were determined as follows: ##TABLE_START  The assumed discount rate is used to discount future benefit obligations back to todays dollars. The U.S. discount rate is based on a benefit cash flow-matching approach and represents the rate at which our benefit obligations could effectively be settled as of our measurement date, December 31. The benefit cash flow-matching approach involves analyzing Caterpillars projected cash flows against a high quality bond yield curve, calculated using a wide population of corporate Aa bonds available on the measurement date. A similar approach is used to determine the assumed discount rate for our most significant non-U.S. plans. In estimating the service and interest cost components of net periodic benefit cost, we utilize a full yield curve approach in determining a discount rate. This approach applies the specific spot rates along the yield curve used in the determination of the benefit obligation to the relevant projected cash flows. ##TABLE_END Discount rates are sensitive to changes in interest rates. A decrease in the discount rate would increase our obligation and future expense. ##TABLE_START  The expected long-term rate of return on plan assets is based on our estimate of long-term passive returns for equities and fixed income securities weighted by the allocation of our plan assets. Based on historical performance, we increase the passive returns due to our active management of the plan assets. This rate is impacted by changes in general market conditions, but because it represents a long-term rate, it is not significantly impacted by short-term market swings. Changes in our allocation of plan assets would also impact this rate. For example, a shift to more fixed income securities would lower the rate. A decrease in the rate would increase our expense. The expected return on plan assets is calculated using the fair value of plan assets as of our measurement date, December 31. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  The expected rate of compensation increase is used to develop benefit obligations using projected pay at retirement. It represents average long-term salary increases. This rate is influenced by our long-term compensation policies. An increase in the rate would increase our obligation and expense. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  The assumed health care trend rate represents the rate at which health care costs are assumed to increase and is based on historical and expected experience. Changes in our projections of future health care costs due to general economic conditions and those specific to health care (e.g., technology driven cost changes) will impact this trend rate. An increase in the trend rate would increase our obligation and expense. ##TABLE_END The effects of actual results differing from our assumptions and the effects of changing assumptions are considered actuarial gains or losses. We recognize actuarial gains or losses immediately through earnings upon the annual remeasurement in the fourth quarter, or on an interim basis as triggering events warrant remeasurement. See Note 12 for further information regarding the accounting for postretirement benefits.  Post-sale discount reserve  We provide discounts to dealers through merchandising programs. We have numerous programs that are designed to promote the sale of our products. The most common dealer programs provide a discount when the dealer sells a product to a targeted end user. The amount of accrued post-sale discounts was $1,544 million and $1,426 million as of December 31, 2018 and 2017 , respectively. The reserve represents discounts that we expect to pay on previously sold units and is reviewed at least quarterly. The reserve is adjusted if discounts paid differ from those estimated. Historically, those adjustments have not been material.  Credit loss reserve  The allowance for credit losses is an estimate of the losses inherent in our finance receivable portfolio and includes consideration of accounts that have been individually identified as impaired, as well as pools of finance receivables where it is probable that certain receivables in the pool are impaired but the individual accounts cannot yet be identified. In identifying and measuring impairment, management takes into consideration past loss experience, known and inherent risks in the portfolio, adverse situations that may affect the borrowers ability to repay, estimated value of underlying collateral and current economic conditions. Accounts are identified for individual review based on past-due status and information available about the customer, such as financial statements, news reports and published credit ratings, as well as general information regarding industry trends and the economic environment in which our customers operate. The allowance for credit losses attributable to finance receivables that are individually evaluated and determined to be impaired is based on the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the receivables effective interest rate, the fair value of the collateral for collateral-dependent receivables or the observable market price of the receivable. In determining collateral value, we estimate the current fair market value of the collateral less selling costs. We also consider credit enhancements such as additional collateral and contractual third-party guarantees. The allowance for credit losses attributable to the remaining accounts not yet individually identified as impaired is estimated based on loss forecast models utilizing probabilities of default, our estimate of the loss emergence period and the estimated loss given default. In addition, qualitative factors not able to be fully captured in our loss forecast models including industry trends, macroeconomic factors and model imprecision are considered in the evaluation of the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses. These qualitative factors are subjective and require a degree of management judgment. While management believes it has exercised prudent judgment and applied reasonable assumptions, there can be no assurance that in the future, changes in economic conditions or other factors would not cause changes in the financial health of our customers. If the financial health of our customers deteriorates, the timing and level of payments received could be impacted and therefore, could result in a change to our estimated losses. Income taxes  We are subject to the income tax laws of the many jurisdictions in which we operate. These tax laws are complex, and the manner in which they apply to our facts is sometimes open to interpretation. In establishing the provision for income taxes, we must make judgments about the application of these inherently complex tax laws. Our income tax positions and analysis are based on currently enacted tax law. Future changes in tax law or related interpretations could significantly impact the provision for income taxes, the amount of taxes payable, and the deferred tax asset and liability balances. Changes in tax law are reflected in the period of enactment with related interpretations considered in the period received. On January 15, 2019, the U.S. Treasury issued final regulations providing additional guidance related to the calculation of the mandatory deemed repatriation of non-U.S. earnings. We are currently evaluating the impact of these regulations and will recognize any resulting adjustments in the first quarter of 2019. Despite our belief that our tax return positions are consistent with applicable tax laws, we believe that taxing authorities could challenge certain positions. Settlement of any challenge can result in no change, a complete disallowance, or some partial adjustment reached through negotiations or litigation. We record tax benefits for uncertain tax positions based upon managements evaluation of the information available at the reporting date. To be recognized in the financial statements, a tax benefit must be at least more likely than not of being sustained based on technical merits. The benefit for positions meeting the recognition threshold is measured as the largest benefit more likely than not of being realized upon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information. Significant judgment is required in making these determinations and adjustments to unrecognized tax benefits may be necessary to reflect actual taxes payable upon settlement. Adjustments related to positions impacting the effective tax rate affect the provision for income taxes. Adjustments related to positions impacting the timing of deductions impact deferred tax assets and liabilities. For tax years 2007 to 2012 including the impact of a loss carryback to 2005, the IRS has proposed to tax in the United States profits earned from certain parts transactions by Caterpillar SARL (CSARL), based on the IRS examination teams application of substance-over-form or assignment-of-income judicial doctrines. CSARL is primarily taxable locally in Switzerland. We are vigorously contesting the proposed increases to tax and penalties for these years of approximately $2.3 billion. We believe that the relevant transactions complied with applicable tax laws and did not violate judicial doctrines. The purchase of parts by CSARL from unrelated parties and the subsequent sale of those parts to unrelated dealers outside the United States have substantial legal, commercial, and economic consequences for the parties involved. Therefore, we have concluded that the largest amount of benefit that is more likely than not to be sustained related to this position is the entire benefit. As a result, no amount related to these IRS adjustments is reflected in unrecognized tax benefits. We have filed U.S. income tax returns on this same basis for years after 2012. We currently believe the ultimate disposition of this matter will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position, liquidity or results of operations. Deferred tax assets generally represent tax benefits for tax deductions or credits available in future tax returns. Certain estimates and assumptions are required to determine whether it is more likely than not that all or some portion of the benefit of a deferred tax asset will not be realized. In making this assessment, management analyzes the trend of U.S. GAAP earnings and estimates the impact of future taxable income, reversing temporary differences and available prudent and feasible tax planning strategies. We give less weight in this analysis to mark-to-market adjustments to remeasure our pension and OPEB plans as we do not consider these adjustments indicative of ongoing earnings trends. Should a change in facts or circumstances lead to a change in judgment about the ultimate realizability of a deferred tax asset, we record or adjust the related valuation allowance in the period that the change in facts and circumstances occurs, along with a corresponding increase or decrease in the provision for income taxes. OTHER MATTERS  ENVIRONMENTAL AND LEGAL MATTERS The  Company is regulated by federal, state and international environmental laws governing our use, transport and disposal of substances and control of emissions. In addition to governing our manufacturing and other operations, these laws often impact the development of our products, including, but not limited to, required compliance with air emissions standards applicable to internal combustion engines. We have made, and will continue to make, significant research and development and capital expenditures to comply with these emissions standards. We are engaged in remedial activities at a number of locations, often with other companies, pursuant to federal and state laws. When it is probable we will pay remedial costs at a site, and those costs can be reasonably estimated, the investigation, remediation, and operating and maintenance costs are accrued against our earnings. Costs are accrued based on consideration of currently available data and information with respect to each individual site, including available technologies, current applicable laws and regulations, and prior remediation experience. Where no amount within a range of estimates is more likely, we accrue the minimum. Where multiple potentially responsible parties are involved, we consider our proportionate share of the probable costs. In formulating the estimate of probable costs, we do not consider amounts expected to be recovered from insurance companies or others. We reassess these accrued amounts on a quarterly basis. The amount recorded for environmental remediation is not material and is included in Accrued expenses. We believe there is no more than a remote chance that a material amount for remedial activities at any individual site, or at all the sites in the aggregate, will be required. On January 7, 2015, the Company received a grand jury subpoena from the U.S. District Court for the Central District of Illinois. The subpoena requests documents and information from the Company relating to, among other things, financial information concerning U.S. and non-U.S. Caterpillar subsidiaries (including undistributed profits of non-U.S. subsidiaries and the movement of cash among U.S. and non-U.S. subsidiaries). The Company has received additional subpoenas relating to this investigation requesting additional documents and information relating to, among other things, the purchase and resale of replacement parts by Caterpillar Inc. and non-U.S. Caterpillar subsidiaries, dividend distributions of certain non-U.S. Caterpillar subsidiaries, and Caterpillar SARL and related structures. On March 2-3, 2017, agents with the Department of Commerce, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and the Internal Revenue Service executed search and seizure warrants at three facilities of the Company in the Peoria, Illinois area, including its former corporate headquarters. The warrants identify, and agents seized, documents and information related to, among other things, the export of products from the United States, the movement of products between the United States and Switzerland, the relationship between Caterpillar Inc. and Caterpillar SARL, and sales outside the United States. It is the Companys understanding that the warrants, which concern both tax and export activities, are related to the ongoing grand jury investigation. The Company is continuing to cooperate with this investigation. The Company is unable to predict the outcome or reasonably estimate any potential loss; however, we currently believe that this matter will not have a material adverse effect on the Companys consolidated results of operations, financial position or liquidity. On March 20, 2014, Brazils Administrative Council for Economic Defense (CADE) published a Technical Opinion which named 18 companies and over 100 individuals as defendants, including two subsidiaries of Caterpillar Inc., MGE - Equipamentos e Servios Ferrovirios Ltda. (MGE) and Caterpillar Brasil Ltda. The publication of the Technical Opinion opened CADE's official administrative investigation into allegations that the defendants participated in anticompetitive bid activity for the construction and maintenance of metro and train networks in Brazil. While companies cannot be held criminally liable for anticompetitive conduct in Brazil, criminal charges have been brought against two current employees of MGE and one former employee of MGE involving the same conduct alleged by CADE. The Company has responded to all requests for information from the authorities. The Company is unable to predict the outcome or reasonably estimate the potential loss; however, we currently believe that this matter will not have a material adverse effect on the Company's consolidated results of operations, financial position or liquidity. In addition, we are involved in other unresolved legal actions that arise in the normal course of business. The most prevalent of these unresolved actions involve disputes related to product design, manufacture and performance liability (including claimed asbestos and welding fumes exposure), contracts, employment issues, environmental matters, intellectual property rights, taxes (other than income taxes) and securities laws. The aggregate range of reasonably possible losses in excess of accrued liabilities, if any, associated with these unresolved legal actions is not material. In some cases, we cannot reasonably estimate a range of loss because there is insufficient information regarding the matter. However, we believe there is no more than a remote chance that any liability arising from these matters would be material. Although it is not possible to predict with certainty the outcome of these unresolved legal actions, we believe that these actions will not individually or in the aggregate have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations, financial position or liquidity.  RETIREMENT BENEFITS We recognize mark-to-market gains and losses immediately through earnings upon the remeasurement of our pension and OPEB plans. Mark-to-market gains and losses represent the effects of actual results differing from our assumptions and the effects of changing assumptions. Changes in discount rates and differences between the actual return on plan assets and the expected return on plan assets generally have the largest impact on mark-to-market gains and losses. We recognized expense of $415 million, $342 million and $957 million in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively, related to our defined benefit pension and OPEB plans. The increase in expense in 2018 compared to 2017 was primarily due to higher net mark-to-market losses in 2018 compared to 2017. This was partially offset by a higher expected return on plan assets and curtailment gains compared to curtailment and termination charges in 2017. The decrease in expense in 2017 compared to 2016 was primarily due to lower net mark-to-market losses in 2017 compared to 2016. This was partially offset by an unfavorable change in amortization of prior service credits, curtailment and termination charges and a lower expected return on plan assets. The primary factors that resulted in mark-to-market losses for 2018, 2017 and 2016 are described below. The net mark-to-market losses were included in Other income (expense) in the Results of Operations. ##TABLE_START  2018 net mark-to-market loss of $495 million - Primarily due to the difference between the actual return on plan assets compared to the expected return on plan assets (U.S. pension plans had an actual rate of return of negative 5.4 percent compared to an expected rate of return of 6.3 percent). This was partially offset by higher discount rates at the end of 2018 compared to the end of 2017. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  2017 net mark-to-market loss of $301 million - Primarily due to lower discount rates at the end of 2017 compared to the end of 2016 and changes in our mortality assumption (discussed below). This was partially offset by the difference between the actual return on plan assets compared to the expected return on plan assets (U.S. pension plans had an actual rate of return of 15.5 percent compared to an expected rate of return of 6.7 percent). ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  2016 net mark-to-market loss of $985 million - Primarily due to lower discount rates at the end of 2016 compared to the end of 2015 and changes in our U.S. mortality assumption (discussed below). This was partially offset by the difference between the actual return on plan assets compared to the expected return on plan assets (U.S. pension plans had an actual rate of return of 7.8 percent compared to an expected rate of return of 6.9 percent). ##TABLE_END In the fourth quarter of 2017, the company reviewed and made changes to the mortality assumptions primarily for our U.S. pension plans which resulted in an overall increase in the life expectancy of plan participants. As of December 31, 2017 these changes resulted in an increase in our Liability for postemployment benefits of approximately $290 million. In the fourth quarter of 2016, the company adopted new mortality improvement scales released by the Society of Actuaries for our U.S. pension and OPEB plans. As of December 31, 2016, this resulted in an increase in our Liability for postemployment benefits of approximately $200 million. In the first quarter of 2017, we announced the closure of our Gosselies, Belgium facility. This announcement impacted certain employees that participated in a defined benefit pension plan and resulted in a net loss of $20 million in the first quarter of 2017 for curtailment and termination benefits. We expect our total defined benefit pension and OPEB expense (excluding the impact of mark-to-market gains and losses) to increase approximately $260 million in 2019. This increase is primarily due to a lower expected return on plan assets (U.S. pension plans have an expected rate of return of 5.9 percent in 2019 compared to 6.3 percent in 2018). In general, our strategy for both the U.S. and the non-U.S. pensions includes ongoing alignment of our investments to our liabilities, while reducing risk in our portfolio. For our U.S. pension plans, our year-end 2018 asset allocation was 70 percent fixed income, 27 percent equities and 3 percent other. Our current U.S. pension target asset allocation is 70 percent fixed income and 30 percent equities. The target allocation is revisited periodically to ensure it reflects our overall objectives. The U.S. plans are rebalanced to within the appropriate target asset allocation ranges on a monthly basis. The year-end 2018 asset allocation for our non-U.S. pension plans was 78 percent fixed income, 13 percent equities, 5 percent real estate and 4 percent other. The 2018 weighted-average target allocation for our non-U.S. pension plans was also 78 percent fixed income, 13 percent equities, 5 percent real estate and 4 percent other. The target allocations for each plan vary based upon local statutory requirements, demographics of the plan participants and funded status. The frequency of rebalancing for the non-U.S. plans varies depending on the plan. Contributions to our pension and OPEB plans were $1.4 billion and $1.6 billion in 2018 and 2017, respectively. Both years included a $1.0 billion discretionary contribution to our U.S. pension plans. We expect to make approximately $315 million of contributions to our pension and OPEB plans in 2019. We believe we have adequate resources to fund both pension and OPEB plans. Effective January 1, 2018, we adopted new accounting guidance issued by the FASB related to the presentation of net periodic pension costs and net periodic postretirement benefit costs. The change in presentation was applied retrospectively to prior years. For further information see Note 1J - \"Operations and summary of significant accounting policies - New Accounting Guidance\" of Part II, Item 8 \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\" Actuarial assumptions have a significant impact on both pension and OPEB expenses. The effects of a one percentage point change in our primary actuarial assumptions on 2018 benefit costs and year-end obligations are included in the table below. ##TABLE_START      ##TABLE_ENDPostretirement Benefit Plan Actuarial Assumptions Sensitivity  The effects of a one percentage-point change in our primary actuarial assumptions on 2018 pension and OPEB costs and obligations are as follows:  ##TABLE_START   2018 Benefit Cost  Year-end Benefit Obligation (Millions of dollars)  One percentage- point increase  One percentage- point decrease  One percentage- point increase  One percentage- point decrease U.S. Pension benefits:         Assumed discount rate  $  $ (85 )  $ (1,625 )  $ 1,970 Expected rate of compensation increase   (2 )   (5 ) Expected long-term rate of return on plan assets  (129 )      Non-U.S. Pension benefits:         Assumed discount rate   (11 )  (560 )  Expected rate of compensation increase   (6 )   (36 ) Expected long-term rate of return on plan assets  (42 )      Other postretirement benefits:         Assumed discount rate   (12 )  (318 )  Expected rate of compensation increase         Expected long-term rate of return on plan assets  (4 )      Assumed health care cost trend rate   (11 )   (117 )          ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START Primary Actuarial Assumptions                      U.S. Pension Benefits  Non-U.S. Pension Benefits  Other Postretirement Benefits           Weighted-average assumptions used to determine benefit obligations, end of year:                   Discount rate  4.2 %  3.5 %  4.0 %  2.5 %  2.4 %  2.5 %  4.2 %  3.6 %  4.0 % Rate of compensation increase  4.0 %  4.0 %  4.0 %  3.0 %  4.0 %  4.0 %  4.0 %  4.0 %  4.0 %                    Weighted-average assumptions used to determine net cost:                   Discount rate used to measure service cost  3.7 %  4.2 %  4.5 %  2.3 %  2.4 %  2.9 %  3.5 %  3.9 %  4.2 % Discount rate used to measure interest cost  3.2 %  3.3 %  3.4 %  2.2 %  2.3 %  2.8 %  3.2 %  3.3 %  3.3 % Expected rate of return on plan assets  6.3 %  6.7 %  6.9 %  5.2 %  5.9 %  6.1 %  7.5 %  7.5 %  7.5 % Rate of compensation increase  4.0 %  4.0 %  4.0 %  4.0 %  4.0 %  3.6 %  4.0 %  4.0 %  4.0 %                    Health care cost trend rates at year-end:                   Health care trend rate assumed for next year  6.1 %  6.1 %  6.6 % Rate that the cost trend rate gradually declines to  5.0 %  5.0 %  5.0 % Year that the cost trend rate reaches ultimate rate                       ##TABLE_ENDSENSITIVITY  Foreign Exchange Rate Sensitivity  Machinery, Energy  Transportation operations use foreign currency forward and option contracts to manage unmatched foreign currency cash inflow and outflow. Our objective is to minimize the risk of exchange rate movements that would reduce the U.S. dollar value of our foreign currency cash flow. Our policy allows for managing anticipated foreign currency cash flow for up to five years. Based on the anticipated and firmly committed cash inflow and outflow for our Machinery, Energy  Transportation operations for the next 12 months and the foreign currency derivative instruments in place at year-end, a hypothetical 10 percent weakening of the U.S. dollar relative to all other currencies would adversely affect our expected 2019 cash flow for our Machinery, Energy  Transportation operations by approximately $250 million. Last year similar assumptions and calculations yielded a potential $200 million adverse impact on 2018 cash flow. We determine our net exposures by calculating the difference in cash inflow and outflow by currency and adding or subtracting outstanding foreign currency derivative instruments. We multiply these net amounts by 10 percent to determine the sensitivity.  Since our policy for Financial Products operations is to hedge the foreign exchange risk when the currency of our debt portfolio does not match the currency of our receivable portfolio, a 10 percent change in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to all other currencies would not have a material effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flow. Neither our policy nor the effect of a 10 percent change in the value of the U.S. dollar has changed from that reported at the end of last year. The effect of the hypothetical change in exchange rates ignores the effect this movement may have on other variables, including competitive risk. If it were possible to quantify this competitive impact, the results would probably be different from the sensitivity effects shown above. In addition, it is unlikely that all currencies would uniformly strengthen or weaken relative to the U.S. dollar. In reality, some currencies may weaken while others may strengthen. Our primary exposure (excluding competitive risk) is to exchange rate movements in the Japanese yen, British pound, Indian rupee, Swiss franc and Australian dollar.  Interest Rate Sensitivity  For our Machinery, Energy  Transportation operations, we have the option to use interest rate contracts to lower the cost of borrowed funds by attaching fixed-to-floating interest rate contracts to fixed-rate debt, and by entering into forward rate agreements on future debt issuances. A hypothetical 100 basis point adverse move in interest rates along the entire interest rate yield curve would have a minimal impact to the 2019 pre-tax earnings of Machinery, Energy  Transportation. Last year, similar assumptions and calculations yielded a minimal impact to 2018 pre-tax earnings.  For our Financial Products operations, we use interest rate derivative instruments primarily to meet our match-funding objectives and strategies. We have a match-funding policy whereby the interest rate profile (fixed or floating rate) of our debt portfolio is matched to the interest rate profile of our earning asset portfolio (finance receivables and operating leases) within certain parameters. In connection with that policy, we use interest rate derivative instruments to modify the debt structure. Match funding assists us in maintaining our interest rate spreads, regardless of the direction interest rates move.  In order to properly manage sensitivity to changes in interest rates, Financial Products measures the potential impact of different interest rate assumptions on pre-tax earnings. All on-balance sheet positions, including derivative financial instruments, are included in the analysis. The primary assumptions included in the analysis are that there are no new fixed rate assets or liabilities, the proportion of fixed rate debt to fixed rate assets remains unchanged and the level of floating rate assets and debt remain constant. An analysis of the December 31, 2018 balance sheet, using these assumptions, estimates the impact of a 100 basis point immediate and sustained adverse change in interest rates to have a minimal impact on 2019 pre-tax earnings. Last year, similar assumptions and calculations yielded a minimal impact to 2018 pre-tax earnings.  This analysis does not necessarily represent our current outlook of future market interest rate movement, nor does it consider any actions management could undertake in response to changes in interest rates. Accordingly, no assurance can be given that actual results would be consistent with the results of our estimate. NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES The following definitions are provided for the non-GAAP financial measures used in this report. These non-GAAP financial measures have no standardized meaning prescribed by U.S. GAAP and therefore are unlikely to be comparable to the calculation of similar measures for other companies. Management does not intend these items to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the related GAAP measures. We believe it is important to separately quantify the profit impact of several significant items in order for our results to be meaningful to our readers. These items consist of (i) restructuring costs, which are incurred in the current year to generate longer term benefits, (ii) pension and OPEB mark-to-market losses resulting from plan remeasurements, (iii) certain deferred tax valuation allowance adjustments, (iv) U.S. tax reform impact and (v) a gain on the sale of an equity investment. We do not consider these items indicative of earnings from ongoing business activities and believe the non-GAAP measures will provide useful perspective on underlying business results and trends, and a means to assess our period-over-period results. Reconciliations of adjusted operating profit margin to the most directly comparable GAAP measure, operating profit as a percent of sales and revenues are as follows: ##TABLE_START   Three Months Ended December 31,  Twelve Months Ended December 31,      Operating profit as a percent of total sales and revenues  13.1 %  10.8 %  15.2 %  9.8 % Restructuring costs  0.7 %  1.9 %  0.7 %  2.7 % Adjusted operating profit margin  13.8 %  12.7 %  15.9 %  12.5 %          ##TABLE_ENDReconciliations of adjusted profit before taxes to the most directly comparable GAAP measure, consolidated profit before taxes, are as follows: ##TABLE_START   Three Months Ended December 31,  Twelve Months Ended December 31, (millions of dollars)     Profit before taxes  $ 1,367  $ 1,111  $ 7,822  $ 4,082 Restructuring costs  $  $  $  $ 1,256 Mark-to-market losses  $  $  $  $ Gain on sale of equity investment  $   $   $   $ (85 ) Adjusted profit before taxes  $ 1,955  $ 1,657  $ 8,703  $ 5,554          ##TABLE_ENDReconciliations of adjusted profit per share to the most directly comparable GAAP measure, diluted profit per share, are as follows: ##TABLE_START   Three Months Ended December 31,  Twelve Months Ended December 31,      Profit (Loss) per share - diluted  $ 1.78  $ (2.18 )  $ 10.26  $ 1.26 Per share restructuring costs 1  $ 0.13  $ 0.31  $ 0.50  $ 1.68 Per share mark-to-market losses 2  $ 0.66  $ 0.26  $ 0.64  $ 0.26 Per share deferred tax valuation allowance adjustments  $ (0.11 )  $ (0.18 )  $ (0.01 )  $ (0.18 ) Per share U.S. tax reform impact  $ 0.09  $ 3.91  $ (0.17 )  $ 3.95 Per share gain on sale of equity investment 2  $   $   $   $ (0.09 ) Adjusted profit per share  $ 2.55  $ 2.16  $ 11.22  $ 6.88          1 At statutory tax rates. 2017 is prior to consideration of U.S. tax reform.

(company) is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act. Our internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of our financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Our internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.  Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.  Management assessed the effectiveness of the companys internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2018 . In making this assessment, we used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework (2013). Based on our assessment we concluded that, as of December 31, 2018 , the companys internal control over financial reporting was effective based on those criteria.  The effectiveness of the companys internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2018 has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm. Their report appears on pages 66-67.   ##TABLE_START  /s/ D. James Umpleby, III   D. James Umpleby, III   Chief Executive Officer           /s/ Andrew R.J. Bonfield   Andrew R.J.

Opinions on the Financial Statements and Internal Control over Financial Reporting We have audited the accompanying consolidated  statement of financial position of Caterpillar Inc. and its subsidiaries (the Company) as of December 31, 2018 and 2017,  and the related consolidated statements of results of operations, comprehensive income (loss), changes in shareholders equity and cash flow for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2018, including the related notes (collectively referred to as the consolidated  financial statements).  We also have audited the Companys internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2018, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework  (2013)  issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). In our opinion, the consolidated  financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2018  and 2017, and the results of its  operations and its  cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2018  in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2018, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework  (2013)  issued by the COSO. Basis for Opinions The Companys management is responsible for these consolidated  financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Managements Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express opinions on the Companys consolidated  financial statements and on the Companys internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated  financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audits of the consolidated  financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated  financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated  financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the  consolidated  financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions. Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting A companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. /s/PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP Peoria, Illinois February 14, 2019 We have served as the Companys auditor since 1925.  ##TABLE_START STATEMENT 1 Caterpillar Inc.

Operations and summary of significant accounting policies ##TABLE_END  ##TABLE_START A. Nature of operations ##TABLE_END  Information in our financial statements and related commentary are presented in the following categories:  Machinery, Energy  Transportation (MET)  Represents the aggregate total of Construction Industries, Resource Industries, Energy  Transportation and All Other operating segments and related corporate items and eliminations.  Financial Products  Primarily includes the companys Financial Products Segment. This category includes Caterpillar Financial Services Corporation (Cat Financial), Caterpillar Insurance Holdings Inc. (Insurance Services) and their respective subsidiaries.  Our products are sold primarily under the brands Caterpillar, CAT, design versions of CAT and Caterpillar, \"EMD,\" FG Wilson, MaK, MWM, Perkins, Progress Rail, SEM and Solar Turbines.  We conduct operations in our Machinery, Energy  Transportation lines of business under highly competitive conditions, including intense price competition. We place great emphasis on the high quality and performance of our products and our dealers service support. Although no one competitor is believed to produce all of the same types of equipment that we do, there are numerous companies, large and small, which compete with us in the sale of each of our products.  Our machines are distributed principally through a worldwide organization of dealers (dealer network), 47 located in the United States and 121 located outside the United States, serving 193 countries. Reciprocating engines are sold principally through the dealer network and to other manufacturers for use in products. Some of the reciprocating engines manufactured by our subsidiary Perkins Engines Company Limited, are also sold through its worldwide network of 90 distributors covering 177 countries. The FG Wilson branded electric power generation systems primarily manufactured by our subsidiary Caterpillar Northern Ireland Limited are sold through its worldwide network of 150 distributors covering 109 countries. Some of the large, medium speed reciprocating engines are also sold under the MaK brand through a worldwide network of 20 distributors covering 130 countries. Our dealers do not deal exclusively with our products; however, in most cases sales and servicing of our products are the dealers principal business. Some products, primarily turbines and locomotives, are sold directly to end customers through sales forces employed by the company. At times, these employees are assisted by independent sales representatives.  The Financial Products line of business also conducts operations under highly competitive conditions. Financing for users of Caterpillar products is available through a variety of competitive sources, principally commercial banks and finance and leasing companies. We offer various financing plans designed to increase the opportunity for sales of our products and generate financing income for our company. A significant portion of Financial Products activity is conducted in North America, with additional offices in Latin America, Asia/Pacific, Europe, Africa and Middle East. ##TABLE_START B. Basis of presentation ##TABLE_END  The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Caterpillar Inc. and its subsidiaries where we have a controlling financial interest. Investments in companies where our ownership exceeds 20 percent and we do not have a controlling interest or where the ownership is less than 20 percent and for which we have a significant influence are accounted for by the equity method. We consolidate all variable interest entities (VIEs) where Caterpillar Inc. is the primary beneficiary. For VIEs, we assess whether we are the primary beneficiary as prescribed by the accounting guidance on the consolidation of VIEs. The primary beneficiary of a VIE is the party that has both the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the entitys economic performance and the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits that could potentially be significant to the VIE. See Note 21 for further discussion on a consolidated VIE. We have affiliates, suppliers and dealers that are VIEs of which we are not the primary beneficiary. Although we have provided financial support, we do not have the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the economic performance of each entity. Our maximum exposure to loss from VIEs for which we are not the primary beneficiary was as follows: ##TABLE_START   December 31, (Millions of dollars)    Receivables - trade and other  $  $  Receivables - finance    Long-term receivables - finance    Investments in unconsolidated affiliated companies    Guarantees 1     Total  $  $        1 Related contract was terminated during the first quarter of 2018. No payments were made under the guarantee.          ##TABLE_ENDIn addition, Cat Financial has end-user customers that are VIEs of which we are not the primary beneficiary. Although we have provided financial support to these entities and therefore have a variable interest, we do not have the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact their economic performance. Our maximum exposure to loss from our involvement with these VIEs is limited to the credit risk inherently present in the financial support that we have provided. These risks are evaluated and reflected in our financial statements as part of our overall portfolio of finance receivables and related allowance for credit losses. Shipping and handling costs are included in Cost of goods sold in Statement 1. Other operating (income) expenses primarily include Cat Financials depreciation of equipment leased to others, Insurance Services underwriting expenses, (gains) losses on disposal of long-lived assets, long-lived asset impairment charges, legal settlements and accruals, contract termination costs and employee separation charges.  Prepaid expenses and other current assets in Statement 3 primarily include prepaid rent, prepaid insurance, contract assets, right of return assets, prepaid and refundable income tax, assets held for sale, core to be returned for remanufacturing, restricted cash and other short-term investments. Certain amounts for prior years have been reclassified to conform with the current-year financial statement presentation. See Note 1J for more information. In addition, deferred revenue of $233 million was reclassified from Other current liabilities to Customer advances in Statement 3 as of December 31, 2017 to conform to the current period presentation. ##TABLE_START C. Inventories ##TABLE_END  Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Cost is principally determined using the last-in, first-out (LIFO) method. The value of inventories on the LIFO basis represented about 65 percent of total inventories at December 31, 2018 and 2017 .  If the FIFO (first-in, first-out) method had been in use, inventories would have been $2,009 million and $1,934 million higher than reported at December 31, 2018 and 2017 , respectively. ##TABLE_START D. Depreciation and amortization ##TABLE_END  Depreciation of plant and equipment is computed principally using accelerated methods. Depreciation on equipment leased to others, primarily for Financial Products, is computed using the straight-line method over the term of the lease. The depreciable basis is the original cost of the equipment less the estimated residual value of the equipment at the end of the lease term. In 2018 , 2017 and 2016 , Cat Financial depreciation on equipment leased to others was $819 million , $810 million and $841 million , respectively, and was included in Other operating (income) expenses in Statement 1. In 2018 , 2017 and 2016 , consolidated depreciation expense was $2,435 million , $2,555 million and $2,707 million , respectively. Amortization of purchased finite-lived intangibles is computed principally using the straight-line method, generally not to exceed a period of 20 years .  ##TABLE_START E. Foreign currency translation ##TABLE_END  The functional currency for most of our Machinery, Energy  Transportation consolidated companies is the U.S. dollar. The functional currency for most of our Financial Products and affiliates accounted for under the equity method is the respective local currency. Gains and losses resulting from the remeasurement of foreign currency amounts to the functional currency are included in Other income (expense) in Statement 1. Gains and losses resulting from translating assets and liabilities from the functional currency to U.S. dollars are included in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in Statement 3.  ##TABLE_START F. Derivative financial instruments ##TABLE_END  Our earnings and cash flow are subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates and commodity prices. Our Risk Management Policy (policy) allows for the use of derivative financial instruments to prudently manage foreign currency exchange rate, interest rate and commodity price exposures. Our policy specifies that derivatives are not to be used for speculative purposes. Derivatives that we use are primarily foreign currency forward, option and cross currency contracts, interest rate contracts and commodity forward and option contracts. All derivatives are recorded at fair value. See Note 4 for more information. ##TABLE_START G. Income taxes ##TABLE_END  The provision for income taxes is determined using the asset and liability approach taking into account guidance related to uncertain tax positions. Tax laws require items to be included in tax filings at different times than the items are reflected in the financial statements. A current liability is recognized for the estimated taxes payable for the current year. Deferred taxes represent the future tax consequences expected to occur when the reported amounts of assets and liabilities are recovered or paid. Deferred taxes are adjusted for enacted changes in tax rates and tax laws. Valuation allowances are recorded to reduce deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will not be realized. ##TABLE_START H. Goodwill ##TABLE_END  For acquisitions accounted for as a business combination, goodwill represents the excess of the cost over the fair value of the net assets acquired. We are required to test goodwill for impairment, at the reporting unit level, annually and when events or circumstances make it more likely than not that an impairment may have occurred. A reporting unit is an operating segment or one level below an operating segment (referred to as a component) to which goodwill is assigned when initially recorded. We assign goodwill to reporting units based on our integration plans and the expected synergies resulting from the acquisition. Because Caterpillar is a highly integrated company, the businesses we acquire are sometimes combined with or integrated into existing reporting units. When changes occur in the composition of our operating segments or reporting units, goodwill is reassigned to the affected reporting units based on their relative fair values. We perform our annual goodwill impairment test as of October 1 and monitor for interim triggering events on an ongoing basis. Goodwill is reviewed for impairment utilizing either a qualitative assessment or a quantitative goodwill impairment test. If we choose to perform a qualitative assessment and determine the fair value more likely than not exceeds the carrying value, no further evaluation is necessary. For reporting units where we perform the quantitative goodwill impairment test, we compare the fair value of each reporting unit, which we primarily determine using an income approach based on the present value of discounted cash flows, to the respective carrying value, which includes goodwill. If the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying value, the goodwill is not considered impaired. Beginning in 2017, if the carrying value is higher than the fair value, the difference would be recognized as an impairment loss. Prior to 2017, a two-step process was used. For reporting units where we performed the two-step process, the first step required us to compare the fair value of each reporting unit, which we primarily determined using an income approach based on the present value of discounted cash flows, to the respective carrying value, which includes goodwill. If the fair value of the reporting unit exceeded its carrying value, the goodwill was not considered impaired. If the carrying value was higher than the fair value, there was an indication that an impairment may have existed and the second step was required. In step two, the implied fair value of goodwill was calculated as the excess of the fair value of a reporting unit over the fair values assigned to its assets and liabilities. If the implied fair value of goodwill was less than the carrying value of the reporting units goodwill, the difference was recognized as an impairment loss. See Note 10 for further details. ##TABLE_START I. Estimates in financial statements ##TABLE_END  The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts. The more significant estimates include: residual values for leased assets; fair values for goodwill impairment tests; warranty liability; stock-based compensation and reserves for product liability and insurance losses, postretirement benefits, post-sale discounts, credit losses and income taxes. ##TABLE_START J. New accounting guidance ##TABLE_END  Revenue recognition  In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued new revenue recognition guidance to provide a single, comprehensive revenue recognition model for all contracts with customers. Under the new guidance, an entity will recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers at an amount that the entity expects to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services. A five step model has been introduced for an entity to apply when recognizing revenue. The new guidance also includes enhanced disclosure requirements. The guidance was effective January 1, 2018, and was applied to contracts that were not completed at the date of initial application on a modified retrospective basis through a cumulative effect adjustment to retained earnings as of January 1, 2018. The prior period comparative information has not been recasted and continues to be reported under the accounting guidance in effect for those periods. Under the new guidance, sales of certain turbine machinery units changed to a point-in-time recognition model. Under previous guidance, we accounted for these sales under an over-time model following the percentage-of-completion method as the product was manufactured. In addition, under the new guidance we began to recognize an asset for the value of expected replacement part returns and discontinued lease accounting treatment for certain product sales containing residual value guarantees. See Note 2 for additional information. The cumulative effect of initially applying the new revenue recognition guidance to our consolidated financial statements on January 1, 2018 was as follows: ##TABLE_START Consolidated Statement of Financial Position       (Millions of dollars)  Balance as of December 31, 2017  Cumulative Impact from Adopting New Revenue Guidance  Balance as of January 1, 2018 Assets       Receivables - trade and other  $ 7,436  $ (66 )  $ 7,370 Prepaid expenses and other current assets  $ 1,772  $  $ 2,099 Inventories  $ 10,018  $  $ 10,022 Property, plant and equipment - net  $ 14,155  $ (190 )  $ 13,965 Noncurrent deferred and refundable income taxes  $ 1,693  $  $ 1,695        Liabilities       Accrued expenses  $ 3,220  $  $ 3,446 Customer advances  $ 1,426  $  $ 1,472 Other current liabilities  $ 1,742  $ (17 )  $ 1,725 Other liabilities  $ 4,053  $ (166 )  $ 3,887        Shareholders' equity       Profit employed in the business  $ 26,301  $ (12 )  $ 26,289        ##TABLE_ENDThe impact from adopting the new revenue recognition guidance on our consolidated financial statements was as follows: ##TABLE_START Consolidated Statement of Results of Operations  Year Ended December 31, 2018   As Reported  Previous Accounting Guidance  Impact from Adopting New Revenue Guidance (Millions of dollars)       Sales of Machinery, Energy  Transportation  $ 51,822  $ 51,814  $ Cost of goods sold  $ 36,997  $ 37,007  $ (10 ) Other operating (income) expenses  $ 1,382  $ 1,388  $ (6 ) Operating profit  $ 8,293  $ 8,269  $ Consolidated profit before taxes  $ 7,822  $ 7,798  $ Provision (benefit) for income taxes  $ 1,698  $ 1,693  $ Profit of consolidated companies  $ 6,124  $ 6,105  $ Profit of consolidated and affiliated companies  $ 6,148  $ 6,129  $ Profit  $ 6,147  $ 6,128  $        Consolidated Statement of Financial Position  December 31, 2018   As Reported  Previous Accounting Guidance  Impact from Adopting New Revenue Guidance (Millions of dollars)       Assets       Receivables - trade and other  $ 8,802  $ 8,865  $ (63 ) Prepaid expenses and other current assets  $ 1,765  $ 1,405  $ Inventories  $ 11,529  $ 11,523  $ Noncurrent deferred and refundable income taxes  $ 1,439  $ 1,442  $ (3 )        Liabilities       Accrued expenses  $ 3,573  $ 3,341  $ Customer advances  $ 1,243  $ 1,182  $        Shareholders' equity       Profit employed in the business  $ 30,427  $ 30,420  $        ##TABLE_ENDSimplifying the measurement of inventory - In July 2015, the FASB issued accounting guidance which requires that inventory be measured at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Prior to the issuance of the new guidance, inventory was measured at the lower of cost or market. Replacing the concept of market with the single measurement of net realizable value is intended to create efficiencies for preparers. Inventory measured using the last-in, first-out (LIFO) method and the retail inventory method are not impacted by the new guidance. The guidance was effective January 1, 2017, and was applied prospectively. The adoption did not have a material impact on our financial statements. Recognition and measurement of financial assets and financial liabilities - In January 2016, the FASB issued accounting guidance that affects the accounting for equity investments, financial liabilities accounted for under the fair value option and the presentation and disclosure requirements for financial instruments. Under the new guidance, all equity investments in unconsolidated entities (other than those accounted for using the equity method of accounting) will generally be measured at fair value through earnings. There will no longer be an available-for-sale classification for equity securities with readily determinable fair values. For financial liabilities when the fair value option has been elected, changes in fair value due to instrument-specific credit risk will be recognized separately in other comprehensive income. In addition, the FASB clarified guidance related to the valuation allowance assessment when recognizing deferred tax assets resulting from unrealized losses on available-for-sale debt securities. The guidance was effective January 1, 2018, and was applied on a modified retrospective basis through a cumulative effect adjustment to retained earnings as of January 1, 2018. The adoption did not have a material impact on our financial statements. Lease accounting - In February 2016, the FASB issued accounting guidance that revises the accounting for leases. Under the new guidance, lessees are required to recognize a right-of-use asset and a lease liability for substantially all leases. The new guidance will continue to classify leases as either financing or operating, with classification affecting the pattern of expense recognition. The accounting applied by a lessor under the new guidance will be substantially equivalent to current lease accounting guidance. Entities have the option to adopt the new guidance using a modified retrospective approach through a cumulative effect adjustment to retained earnings applied either to the beginning of the earliest period presented or the beginning of the period of adoption. The new guidance was effective January 1, 2019 and will be applied using a modified retrospective approach through a cumulative effect adjustment to retained earnings as of January 1, 2019. The new guidance provides a number of optional practical expedients in transition. We elected the \"package of practical expedients,\" which allows us not to reassess under the new guidance our prior conclusions about lease identification, lease classification and initial direct costs. We did not elect the use-of-hindsight practical expedient. In addition, the new guidance provides practical expedients for an entitys ongoing lessee accounting. We have elected to not separate lease and non-lease components for the majority of our asset classes. We have elected the short-term lease recognition exemption for all leases that qualify which means we will not recognize right-of-use assets or lease liabilities for these leases. The most significant effects of adoption relate to the recognition of right-of-use assets and lease liabilities on our balance sheet for operating leases and providing new disclosures about our leasing activities. We currently expect the right-of-use assets and lease liabilities as of January 1, 2019 will be approximately $750 million . In addition, we will derecognize about $135 million of existing assets and $360 million of debt obligations for a sale-leaseback transaction that qualifies for sale accounting under the new guidance. The gain associated with this change in accounting will be recognized through opening retained earnings as of January 1, 2019. We do not expect the new guidance to have a material impact on our results of operations. Stock-based compensation  - In March 2016, the FASB issued accounting guidance to simplify several aspects of the accounting for share-based payments. The new guidance changes how reporting entities account for certain aspects of share-based payments, including the accounting for income taxes and the classification of the tax impact on the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flow. Under the new guidance, all excess tax benefits and deficiencies during the period are recognized in income (rather than equity) on a prospective basis. The guidance removes the requirement to delay recognition of excess tax benefits until it reduces income taxes currently payable. This change was required to be applied on a modified retrospective basis, resulting in a cumulative-effect adjustment to opening retained earnings in the period of adoption. In addition, Cash flows related to excess tax benefits are now included in Cash provided by operating activities and will no longer be separately classified as a financing activity. This change was adopted retrospectively. The guidance was effective January 1, 2017, and did not have a material impact on our financial statements. Measurement of credit losses on financial instruments  - In June 2016, the FASB issued accounting guidance to introduce a new model for recognizing credit losses on financial instruments based on an estimate of current expected credit losses. The new guidance will apply to loans, accounts receivable, trade receivables, other financial assets measured at amortized cost, loan commitments and other off-balance sheet credit exposures. The new guidance will also apply to debt securities and other financial assets measured at fair value through other comprehensive income. The new guidance is effective January 1, 2020, with early adoption permitted beginning January 1, 2019. We plan to adopt the new guidance effective January 1, 2020. We are in the process of evaluating the effect of the new guidance on our financial statements. Classification for certain cash receipts and cash payments  - In August 2016, the FASB issued accounting guidance related to the presentation and classification of certain transactions in the statement of cash flows where diversity in practice exists. The guidance was effective January 1, 2018, and was applied on a retrospective basis. The adoption did not have a material impact on our financial statements. Tax accounting for intra-entity asset transfers  - In October 2016, the FASB issued accounting guidance that requires the recognition of tax expense from the sales of intra-entity assets in the seller's tax jurisdiction at the time of transfer. The new guidance does not apply to intra-entity transfers of inventory. Under previous guidance, the tax effects of these assets were deferred until the transferred asset was sold to a third party or otherwise recovered through use. The guidance was effective January 1, 2018, and was applied on a modified retrospective basis through a cumulative effect adjustment to retained earnings as of January 1, 2018. The adoption did not have a material impact on our financial statements. Classification of restricted cash  - In November 2016, the FASB issued accounting guidance related to the presentation and classification of changes in restricted cash on the statement of cash flows where diversity in practice exists. The guidance was effective January 1, 2018, and was applied on a retrospective basis. The adoption did not have a material impact on our financial statements. Clarification on the definition of a business  - In January 2017, the FASB issued accounting guidance to clarify the definition of a business with the objective of adding guidance to assist entities with evaluating whether transactions should be accounted for as acquisitions (or disposals) of assets or businesses. The guidance was effective January 1, 2018, with early adoption permitted. We adopted the guidance effective January 1, 2017, and the adoption did not have a material impact on our financial statements. Simplifying the measurement for goodwill - In January 2017, the FASB issued guidance to simplify the accounting for goodwill impairment. The guidance removes Step 2 of the goodwill impairment test, which requires a hypothetical purchase price allocation. A goodwill impairment will now be the amount by which a reporting units carrying value exceeds its fair value, not to exceed the carrying amount of goodwill. The new guidance will be applied prospectively and is effective January 1, 2020, with early adoption permitted beginning January 1, 2017. We adopted the guidance effective January 1, 2017. The adoption did not have a material impact on our financial statements. Presentation of net periodic pension costs and net periodic postretirement benefit costs - In March 2017, the FASB issued accounting guidance that requires an employer to disaggregate the service cost component from the other components of net periodic benefit cost. Service cost is required to be reported in the same line item or items as other compensation costs arising from services rendered by the pertinent employees during the period. The other components of net periodic benefit cost are required to be reported outside the subtotal for income from operations. Additionally, only the service cost component of net periodic benefit costs is eligible for capitalization. The guidance was effective January 1, 2018. We applied the presentation changes retrospectively and the capitalization change prospectively. The adoption primarily resulted in the reclassification of other components of net periodic benefit cost outside of Operating profit in the Consolidated Statement of Results of Operations. ##TABLE_START Consolidated Statement of Results of Operations         Year Ended December 31, 2017 (Millions of dollars)  As Revised  Previously Reported  Effect of Change Cost of goods sold  $ 31,260  $ 31,049  $ Selling, general and administrative expenses  $ 4,999  $ 5,177  $ (178 ) Research and development expenses  $ 1,842  $ 1,905  $ (63 ) Other operating (income) expenses  $ 2,255  $ 2,279  $ (24 ) Total operating costs  $ 41,002  $ 41,056  $ (54 ) Operating profit  $ 4,460  $ 4,406  $ Other income (expense)  $  $  $ (54 )                 Year Ended December 31, 2016  As Revised  Previously Reported  Effect of Change Cost of goods sold  $ 28,044  $ 28,309  $ (265 ) Selling, general and administrative expenses  $ 4,383  $ 4,686  $ (303 ) Research and development expenses  $ 1,853  $ 1,951  $ (98 ) Other operating (income) expenses  $ 1,904  $ 1,902  $ Total operating costs  $ 37,375  $ 38,039  $ (664 ) Operating profit  $ 1,162  $  $ Other income (expense)  $ (518 )  $  $ (664 )        ##TABLE_ENDPremium amortization on purchased callable debt securities - In March 2017, the FASB issued accounting guidance related to the amortization period for certain purchased callable debt securities held at a premium. Securities held at a premium will be required to be amortized to the earliest call date rather than the maturity date. The new standard was effective January 1, 2019, and will be applied on a modified retrospective basis through a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings as of January 1, 2019. We do not expect the adoption to have a material impact on our financial statements. Clarification on stock-based compensation  - In May 2017, the FASB issued accounting guidance to clarify which changes to the terms or conditions of a share-based payment award require an entity to apply modification accounting. The guidance was effective January 1, 2018, and was applied prospectively. The adoption did not have a material impact on our financial statements. Derivatives and hedging  - In August 2017, the FASB issued accounting guidance to better align hedge accounting with a companys risk management activities, simplify the application of hedge accounting and improve the disclosures of hedging arrangements. The new guidance was effective January 1, 2019, and will be applied using a modified retrospective approach through a cumulative effect adjustment to retained earnings as of January 1, 2019. The impact on our financial statements at the time of adoption will primarily be reclassification of our gains (losses) for designated MET foreign exchange contracts from Other income (expense) to components of Operating profit in Statement 1. We do not expect the adoption to have a material impact on our financial statements.  Reclassification of certain tax effects from accumulated other comprehensive income  - In February 2018, the FASB issued accounting guidance to allow a reclassification from accumulated other comprehensive income to retained earnings for stranded tax effects resulting from U.S. tax reform legislation. The guidance was effective January 1, 2019, and we will make the reclassification in the period of adoption. We do not expect the adoption to have a material impact on our financial statements. Defined benefit plan disclosures  - In August 2018, the FASB issued accounting guidance that revises the annual disclosure requirements for employers by removing and adding certain disclosures for these plans. The applicable requirements that were removed include the disclosure of the amount of prior service cost (credit) that will be amortized from Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) into net periodic benefit cost for the next fiscal year and the effect of a one-percentage-point change in the assumed health care cost trend rates on the service and interest cost components of other postretirement benefit cost and on the accumulated postretirement benefit obligations. The new disclosure requirements include the weighted average interest crediting rates for cash balance plans and other plans with promised interest crediting rates and narrative description of the reasons for significant actuarial gains and losses related to changes in benefit plan obligations or assets for the period. The new guidance is required to be applied on a retrospective basis. The guidance is effective January 1, 2020, with early adoption permitted. We plan to adopt the new guidance effective January 1, 2020, and do not expect the adoption to have a material impact on our financial statements. ##TABLE_START 2. Sales and revenue recognition ##TABLE_END A. Sales of Machinery, Energy  Transportation Sales of Machinery, Energy  Transportation are recognized when all the following criteria are satisfied: (i) a contract with an independently owned and operated dealer or an end user exists which has commercial substance; (ii) it is probable we will collect the amount charged to the dealer or end user; and (iii) we have completed our performance obligation whereby the dealer or end user has obtained control of the product. A contract with commercial substance exists once we receive and accept a purchase order under a dealer sales agreement, or once we enter into a contract with an end user. If collectibility is not probable, the sale is deferred and not recognized until collection is probable or payment is received. Control of our products typically transfers when title and risk of ownership of the product has transferred to the dealer or end user. Typically, where product is produced and sold in the same country, title and risk of ownership transfer when the product is shipped. Products that are exported from a country for sale typically transfer title and risk of ownership at the border of the destination country. Our remanufacturing operations are primarily focused on the remanufacture of Cat engines and components and rail related products. In this business, used engines and related components (core) are inspected, cleaned and remanufactured. In connection with the sale of our remanufactured product to dealers, we collect a deposit that is repaid if the dealer returns an acceptable core within a specified time period. Caterpillar owns and has title to the cores when they are returned from dealers. The rebuilt engine or component (the core plus any new content) is then sold as a remanufactured product to dealers and end users. Revenue is recognized pursuant to the same transfer of control criteria as Machinery, Energy  Transportation sales noted above. At the time of sale, the deposit is recognized in Other current liabilities in Statement 3, and the core to be returned is recognized as an asset in Prepaid expenses and other current assets in Statement 3 at the estimated replacement cost (based on historical experience with usable cores). Upon receipt of an acceptable core, we repay the deposit and relieve the liability. The returned core asset is then transferred into inventory. In the event that the deposit is forfeited (i.e., upon failure by the dealer to return an acceptable core in the specified time period), we recognize the core deposit and the cost of the core in Sales and Cost of goods sold, respectively. We provide discounts to dealers through merchandising programs. We have numerous programs that are designed to promote the sale of our products. The most common dealer programs provide a discount when the dealer sells a product to a targeted end user. Generally, the cost of these discounts is estimated for each product by model by geographic region based on historical experience and known changes in merchandising programs. The cost of these discounts is reported as a reduction to the transaction price when the product sale is recognized. A corresponding post-sale discount reserve is accrued in Statement 3, which represents discounts we expect to pay on previously sold units. If discounts paid differ from those estimated, the difference is reported as a change in the transaction price. Except for replacement parts, no right of return exists on the sale of our products. We estimate replacement part returns based on historical experience and recognize a parts return asset in Prepaid expenses and other current assets in Statement 3, which represents our right to recover replacement parts we expect will be returned. We also recognize a refund liability in Other current liabilities in Statement 3 for the refund we expect to pay for returned parts. If actual replacement part returns differ from those estimated, the difference in the estimated replacement part return asset and refund liability is recognized in Cost of goods sold and Sales, respectively. Our standard dealer invoice terms are established by marketing region. Our invoice terms for end user sales are established by the responsible business unit. Payments from dealers are due shortly after the time of sale. When a sale is made to a dealer, the dealer is responsible for payment even if the product is not sold to an end user. Dealers and end users must make payment within the established invoice terms to avoid potential interest costs. Interest at or above prevailing market rates may be charged on any past due balance, and generally our practice is to not forgive this interest. In addition, Cat Financial provides wholesale inventory financing for a dealer's purchase of inventory. Wholesale inventory receivables have varying payment terms and are included in Receivables  trade and other and Long-term receivables  trade and other in Statement 3. See Note 7 for further information. Trade receivables from dealers and end users were $7,743 million and $6,399 million as of December 31, 2018 and January 1, 2018, respectively, and are recognized in Receivables  trade and other in Statement 3. Long-term trade receivables from dealers and end users were $674 million and $639 million as of December 31, 2018 and January 1, 2018, respectively, and are recognized in Long-term receivables  trade and other in Statement 3. We establish a bad debt allowance for Machinery, Energy  Transportation receivables when it becomes probable that the receivable will not be collected. Our allowance for bad debts is not significant. We invoice in advance of recognizing the sale of certain products. Advanced customer payments are recognized as a contract liability in Customer advances and Other liabilities in Statement 3. Long-term customer advances recognized in Other liabilities in Statement 3 were $437 million and $396 million as of December 31, 2018 and January 1, 2018, respectively. We reduce the contract liability when revenue is recognized. During 2018, we recognized $1,294 million of revenue that was recorded as a contract liability at the beginning of 2018. We have elected the practical expedient to not adjust the amount of revenue to be recognized under a contract with a dealer or end user for the effects of time value of money when the timing difference between receipt of payment and recognition of revenue is less than one year. As of December 31, 2018 , we have entered into contracts with dealers and end users for which sales have not been recognized as we have not satisfied our performance obligations and transferred control of the products. The dollar amount of unsatisfied performance obligations for contracts with an original duration greater than one year is $5.8 billion , of which $2.5 billion is expected to be completed and revenue recognized in the twelve months following December 31, 2018 . We have elected the practical expedient to not disclose unsatisfied performance obligations with an original contract duration of one year or less. Contracts with an original duration of one year or less are primarily sales to dealers for machinery, engines and replacement parts. Sales and other related taxes are excluded from the transaction price. Shipping and handling costs associated with outbound freight after control over a product has transferred are accounted for as a fulfillment cost and are included in Cost of goods sold. We provide a standard manufacturers warranty of our products at no additional cost. At the time a sale is recognized, we record estimated future warranty costs. See Note 21 for further discussion of our product warranty liabilities. See Note 23 for further disaggregated sales and revenues information. B. Revenues of Financial Products Revenues of Financial Products are generated primarily from finance revenue on finance receivables and rental payments on operating leases. Finance revenue is recorded over the life of the related finance receivable using the interest method, including the accretion of certain direct origination costs that are deferred. Revenue from rental payments received on operating leases is recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease. Recognition of finance revenue and rental revenue is suspended and the account is placed on non-accrual status when management determines that collection of future income is not probable (generally after 120 days past due). Recognition is resumed, and previously suspended income is recognized, when the account becomes current and collection of remaining amounts is considered probable. See Note 7 for more information. Revenues are presented net of sales and other related taxes. ##TABLE_START 3. Stock-based compensation ##TABLE_END  Our stock-based compensation plans primarily provide for the granting of stock options, stock-settled stock appreciation rights (SARs), restricted stock units (RSUs) and performance-based restricted stock units (PRSUs) to Officers and other key employees, as well as non-employee Directors. Stock options permit a holder to buy Caterpillar stock at the stocks price when the option was granted. SARs permit a holder the right to receive the value in shares of the appreciation in Caterpillar stock that occurred from the date the right was granted up to the date of exercise. RSUs are agreements to issue shares of Caterpillar stock at the time of vesting. PRSUs are similar to RSUs and include performance conditions in the vesting terms of the award.  Our long-standing practices and policies specify that all stock-based compensation awards are approved by the Compensation Committee (the Committee) of the Board of Directors. The award approval process specifies the grant date, value and terms of the award. The same terms and conditions are consistently applied to all employee grants, including Officers. The Committee approves all individual Officer grants. The number of stock-based compensation award units included in an individuals award is determined based on the methodology approved by the Committee. The exercise price methodology approved by the Committee is the closing price of the Company stock on the date of the grant. In June of 2014, shareholders approved the Caterpillar Inc. 2014 Long-Term Incentive Plan (the Plan) under which all new stock-based compensation awards are granted. In June of 2017, the Plan was amended and restated. The Plan initially provided that up to 38,800,000 Common Shares would be reserved for future issuance under the Plan, subject to adjustment in certain events. Subsequent to the shareholder approval of the amendment and restatement of the Plan, an additional 36,000,000 Common Shares became available for all awards under the Plan.  Common stock issued from Treasury stock under the plans totaled 5,590,641 for 2018 , 11,139,748 for 2017 and 4,164,134 for 2016 . The total number of shares authorized for equity awards under the amended and restated Caterpillar Inc. 2014 Long-Term Incentive Plan is 74,800,000 , of which 44,139,162 shares remained available for issuance as of December 31, 2018.  Stock option and RSU awards generally vest according to a three -year graded vesting schedule. One-third of the award will become vested on the first anniversary of the grant date, one-third of the award will become vested on the second anniversary of the grant date and one-third of the award will become vested on the third anniversary of the grant date. PRSU awards generally have a three -year performance period and cliff vest at the end of the period based upon achievement of performance targets established at the time of grant. Upon separation from service, if the participant is 55 years of age or older with more than five years of service, the participant meets the criteria for a \"Long Service Separation.\" Award terms for awards granted in 2016 allow for immediate vesting upon separation of all outstanding options and RSUs with no requisite service period for employees who meet the criteria for a \"Long Service Separation.\" Compensation expense for the 2016 grant was fully recognized immediately on the grant date for these employees. Award terms for the 2018 and 2017 grants allow for continued vesting as of each vesting date specified in the award document for employees who meet the criteria for a \"Long Service Separation\" and fulfill a requisite service period of six months. Compensation expense for eligible employees for the 2018 and 2017 grants was recognized over the period from the grant date to the end date of the six-month requisite service period. For employees who become eligible for a \"Long Service Separation\" subsequent to the end date of the six-month requisite service period and prior to the completion of the vesting period, compensation expense is recognized over the period from the grant date to the date eligibility is achieved. At grant, SARs and option awards have a term life of ten years . For awards granted prior to 2016, if the Long Service Separation criteria are met, the vested options/SARs have a life that is the lesser of ten years from the original grant date or five years from the separation date. For awards granted in 2018, 2017, and 2016, the vested options have a life equal to ten years from the original grant date. Prior to 2017, all outstanding PRSU awards granted to employees eligible for a \"Long Service Separation\" may vest at the end of the performance period based upon achievement of the performance target. Compensation expense for the 2016 PRSU grant was fully recognized immediately on the grant date for these employees. For PRSU awards granted in 2018 and 2017, only a prorated number of shares may vest at the end of the performance period based upon achievement of the performance target, with the proration based upon the number of months of continuous employment during the three -year performance period. Employees with a \"Long Service Separation\" must also fulfill a six-month requisite service period in order to be eligible for the prorated vesting of outstanding PRSU awards granted in 2018 and 2017. Compensation expense for the 2018 and 2017 PRSU grants is being recognized on a straight-line basis over the three -year performance period for all participants.  Accounting guidance on share-based payments requires companies to estimate the fair value of options/SARs on the date of grant using an option-pricing model. The fair value of our option/SAR grants was estimated using a lattice-based option-pricing model. The lattice-based option-pricing model considers a range of assumptions related to volatility, risk-free interest rate and historical employee behavior. Expected volatility was based on historical Caterpillar stock price movement and current implied volatilities from traded options on Caterpillar stock. The risk-free interest rate was based on U.S. Treasury security yields at the time of grant. The weighted-average dividend yield was based on historical information. The expected life was determined from the lattice-based model. The lattice-based model incorporated exercise and post vesting forfeiture assumptions based on analysis of historical data. The following table provides the assumptions used in determining the fair value of the Option/SAR awards for the years ended December 31, 2018 , 2017 and 2016 , respectively. ##TABLE_START  Grant Year    Weighted-average dividend yield 2.7 %  3.4 %  3.2 % Weighted-average volatility 30.2 %  29.2 %  31.1 % Range of volatilities 21.5-33.0%  22.1-33.0%  22.5-33.4% Range of risk-free interest rates 2.02-2.87%  0.81-2.35%  0.62-1.73% Weighted-average expected lives 8 years  8 years  8 years       ##TABLE_END Beginning with the 2018 grant, RSU and PRSU awards are credited with dividend equivalent units on each date that a cash dividend is paid to holders of Common Stock. The fair value of the RSU and PRSU awards granted in 2018 was determined as the closing stock price on the date of the grant. Prior to 2018, RSU and PRSU awards were not credited with dividend equivalent units and the fair value was determined by reducing the stock price on the date of the grant by the present value of the estimated dividends to be paid during the vesting period. The estimated dividends were based on Caterpillar's quarterly divided per share at the time of the grant.

Stock-based compensation expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period for awards with terms that specify cliff or graded vesting and contain only service conditions. Stock-based compensation expense for PRSUs is based on the probable number of shares expected to vest and is recognized primarily on a straight-line basis. Before tax, stock-based compensation expense for 2018 , 2017 and 2016 was $197 million , $206 million and $218 million , respectively, with a corresponding income tax benefit of $36 million , $40 million and $61 million , respectively. The amount of stock-based compensation expense capitalized for the years ended December 31, 2018 , 2017 and 2016 did not have a significant impact on our financial statements.  At December 31, 2018 , there was $180 million of total unrecognized compensation cost from stock-based compensation arrangements granted under the plans, which is related to non-vested stock-based awards. The compensation expense is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of approximately 1.8 years . We currently use shares in treasury stock to satisfy share award exercises.  The cash tax benefits realized from stock awards exercised for 2018 , 2017 and 2016 were $103 million , $205 million and $104 million , respectively. We use the direct only method and tax law ordering approach to calculate the tax effects of stock-based compensation.  ##TABLE_START 4. Derivative financial instruments and risk management ##TABLE_END  Our earnings and cash flow are subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates and commodity prices. Our Risk Management Policy (policy) allows for the use of derivative financial instruments to prudently manage foreign currency exchange rate, interest rate and commodity price exposures. Our policy specifies that derivatives are not to be used for speculative purposes. Derivatives that we use are primarily foreign currency forward, option and cross currency contracts, interest rate contracts and commodity forward and option contracts. Our derivative activities are subject to the management, direction and control of our senior financial officers. Risk management practices, including the use of financial derivative instruments, are presented to the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors at least annually.  All derivatives are recognized in Statement 3 at their fair value. On the date the derivative contract is entered into, we designate the derivative as (1) a hedge of the fair value of a recognized asset or liability (fair value hedge), (2) a hedge of a forecasted transaction or the variability of cash flow (cash flow hedge) or (3) an undesignated instrument. Changes in the fair value of a derivative that is qualified, designated and highly effective as a fair value hedge, along with the gain or loss on the hedged recognized asset or liability that is attributable to the hedged risk, are recorded in current earnings. Changes in the fair value of a derivative that is qualified, designated and highly effective as a cash flow hedge are recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) (AOCI), to the extent effective, in Statement 3 until they are reclassified to earnings in the same period or periods during which the hedged transaction affects earnings. Changes in the fair value of undesignated derivative instruments and the ineffective portion of designated derivative instruments are reported in current earnings. Cash flows from designated derivative financial instruments are classified within the same category as the item being hedged on Statement 5. Cash flows from undesignated derivative financial instruments are included in the investing category on Statement 5.  We formally document all relationships between hedging instruments and hedged items, as well as the risk-management objective and strategy for undertaking various hedge transactions. This process includes linking all derivatives that are designated as fair value hedges to specific assets and liabilities in Statement 3 and linking cash flow hedges to specific forecasted transactions or variability of cash flow.  We also formally assess, both at the hedges inception and on an ongoing basis, whether the designated derivatives that are used in hedging transactions are highly effective in offsetting changes in fair values or cash flow of hedged items. When a derivative is determined not to be highly effective as a hedge or the underlying hedged transaction is no longer probable, we discontinue hedge accounting prospectively, in accordance with the derecognition criteria for hedge accounting.  ##TABLE_START A. Foreign currency exchange rate risk ##TABLE_END  Foreign currency exchange rate movements create a degree of risk by affecting the U.S. dollar value of sales made and costs incurred in foreign currencies. Movements in foreign currency rates also affect our competitive position as these changes may affect business practices and/or pricing strategies of non-U.S.-based competitors. Additionally, we have balance sheet positions denominated in foreign currencies, thereby creating exposure to movements in exchange rates.  Our Machinery, Energy  Transportation operations purchase, manufacture and sell products in many locations around the world. As we have a diversified revenue and cost base, we manage our future foreign currency cash flow exposure on a net basis. We use foreign currency forward and option contracts to manage unmatched foreign currency cash inflow and outflow. Our objective is to minimize the risk of exchange rate movements that would reduce the U.S. dollar value of our foreign currency cash flow. Our policy allows for managing anticipated foreign currency cash flow for up to five years . As of December 31, 2018 , the maximum term of these outstanding contracts was approximately 51 months .  We generally designate as cash flow hedges at inception of the contract any Australian dollar, Brazilian real, British pound, Canadian dollar, Chinese yuan, Indian rupee, Japanese yen, Mexican peso, Singapore dollar or Thailand baht forward or option contracts that meet the requirements for hedge accounting and the maturity extends beyond the current quarter-end. Designation is performed on a specific exposure basis to support hedge accounting. The remainder of Machinery, Energy  Transportation foreign currency contracts are undesignated.  As of December 31, 2018 , $8 million of deferred net losses, net of tax, included in equity (AOCI in Statement 3), are expected to be reclassified to current earnings (Other income (expense) in Statement 1) over the next twelve months when earnings are affected by the hedged transactions. The actual amount recorded in Other income (expense) will vary based on exchange rates at the time the hedged transactions impact earnings.  In managing foreign currency risk for our Financial Products operations, our objective is to minimize earnings volatility resulting from conversion and the remeasurement of net foreign currency balance sheet positions, and future transactions denominated in foreign currencies. Our policy allows the use of foreign currency forward, option and cross currency contracts to offset the risk of currency mismatch between our assets and liabilities, and exchange rate risk associated with future transactions denominated in foreign currencies. Our foreign currency forward and option contracts are primarily undesignated. We designate fixed-to-fixed cross currency contracts as cash flow hedges to protect against movements in exchange rates on foreign currency fixed rate assets and liabilities.  ##TABLE_START B. Interest rate risk ##TABLE_END  Interest rate movements create a degree of risk by affecting the amount of our interest payments and the value of our fixed-rate debt. Our practice is to use interest rate contracts to manage our exposure to interest rate changes.  Our Machinery, Energy  Transportation operations generally use fixed-rate debt as a source of funding. Our objective is to minimize the cost of borrowed funds. Our policy allows us to enter into fixed-to-floating interest rate contracts and forward rate agreements to meet that objective. We designate fixed-to-floating interest rate contracts as fair value hedges at inception of the contract, and we designate certain forward rate agreements as cash flow hedges at inception of the contract. Financial Products operations has a match-funding policy that addresses interest rate risk by aligning the interest rate profile (fixed or floating rate) of Cat Financials debt portfolio with the interest rate profile of their receivables portfolio within predetermined ranges on an ongoing basis. In connection with that policy, we use interest rate derivative instruments to modify the debt structure to match assets within the receivables portfolio. This matched funding reduces the volatility of margins between interest-bearing assets and interest-bearing liabilities, regardless of which direction interest rates move.  Our policy allows us to use fixed-to-floating, floating-to-fixed and floating-to-floating interest rate contracts to meet the match-funding objective. We designate fixed-to-floating interest rate contracts as fair value hedges to protect debt against changes in fair value due to changes in the benchmark interest rate. We designate most floating-to-fixed interest rate contracts as cash flow hedges to protect against the variability of cash flows due to changes in the benchmark interest rate. We have, at certain times, liquidated fixed-to-floating and floating-to-fixed interest rate contracts at both Machinery, Energy  Transportation and Financial Products. The gains or losses associated with these contracts at the time of liquidation are amortized into earnings over the original term of the previously designated hedged item.  ##TABLE_START C. Commodity price risk ##TABLE_END  Commodity price movements create a degree of risk by affecting the price we must pay for certain raw material. Our policy is to use commodity forward and option contracts to manage the commodity risk and reduce the cost of purchased materials.  Our Machinery, Energy  Transportation operations purchase base and precious metals embedded in the components we purchase from suppliers. Our suppliers pass on to us price changes in the commodity portion of the component cost. In addition, we are subject to price changes on energy products such as natural gas and diesel fuel purchased for operational use.  Our objective is to minimize volatility in the price of these commodities. Our policy allows us to enter into commodity forward and option contracts to lock in the purchase price of a portion of these commodities within a five -year horizon. All such commodity forward and option contracts are undesignated. The location and fair value of derivative instruments reported in Statement 3 are as follows: ##TABLE_START  Consolidated Statement of Financial Position Location  Asset (Liability) Fair Value (Millions of dollars)   Years ended December 31,     Designated derivatives      Foreign exchange contracts      Machinery, Energy  Transportation Receivables  trade and other  $  $ Machinery, Energy  Transportation Long-term receivables  trade and other    Machinery, Energy  Transportation Accrued expenses  (26 )  (14 ) Machinery, Energy  Transportation Other liabilities  (9 )  (2 ) Financial Products Receivables  trade and other    Financial Products Long-term receivables  trade and other   Financial Products Accrued expenses  (9 )  (57 ) Interest rate contracts      Financial Products Receivables  trade and other    Financial Products Long-term receivables  trade and other   Financial Products Accrued expenses  (40 )  (2 )    $  $ (53 )       Undesignated derivatives      Foreign exchange contracts      Machinery, Energy  Transportation Receivables  trade and other  $  $ Machinery, Energy  Transportation Accrued expenses  (21 )  (9 ) Financial Products Receivables  trade and other   Financial Products Long-term receivables  trade and other    Financial Products Accrued expenses  (14 )  (9 ) Commodity contracts      Machinery, Energy  Transportation Receivables  trade and other   Machinery, Energy  Transportation Accrued expenses  (31 )      $ (43 )  $       ##TABLE_ENDThe total notional amounts of the derivative instruments are as follows: ##TABLE_START  Years ended December 31, (Millions of dollars)        Machinery, Energy  Transportation  $ 1,834  $ 3,190 Financial Products  $ 10,210  $ 3,691      ##TABLE_ENDThe notional amounts of the derivative financial instruments do not represent amounts exchanged by the parties.

See Note 10 for further discussion. ##TABLE_END Included in the line item above labeled \"Non-U.S. subsidiaries taxed at other than the U.S. rate\" are the effects of local and U.S. taxes related to earnings of non-U.S. subsidiaries, changes in the amount of unrecognized tax benefits associated with these earnings, losses at non-U.S. subsidiaries without local tax benefits due to valuation allowances, and other permanent differences between tax and U.S. GAAP results. Although not individually significant by jurisdiction, pre-tax permanent differences due to nondeductible net foreign exchange gains/losses of non-U.S. subsidiaries were approximately $180 million of net losses in 2018 , $160 million of net gains in 2017, and $130 million of net losses in 2016 . Included in the line item above labeled \"Valuation Allowances\" for 2018 is a decrease in the valuation allowance for U.S. state deferred tax assets resulting in a $63 million non-cash benefit, net of federal deferred tax adjustment at 21 percent , along with a decrease in the valuation allowance for a non-U.S. subsidiary of $25 million . The primary driver of the decrease in the U.S. state valuation allowance was improved U.S. GAAP profits expected to recur in certain state jurisdictions. This compares to a decrease of $111 million in 2017 and an increase of $141 million in 2016 to the provision for income taxes related to changes in the valuation allowance for U.S. state deferred tax assets, net of federal deferred tax adjustment at 35 percent . Also included was a charge of $59 million to correct for an error which resulted in an understatement of the valuation allowance offsetting deferred tax assets for prior years. This error had the effect of overstating profit by $17 million and $33 million million for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Management has concluded that the error was not material to any period presented. We have completed our accounting for the income tax effects of U.S. tax reform legislation and included measurement period adjustments in 2018 of $104 million to reduce the provisionally estimated charge of $ 2.371 billion recognized during the fourth quarter of 2017. A $154 million benefit revised the estimated impact of the write-down of U.S. net deferred tax assets to reflect the reduction in the U.S. corporate tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent . This benefit primarily related to the decision to make an additional discretionary pension contribution of $1.0 billion to U.S. pension plans in 2018 which was treated as deductible on the 2017 U.S. tax return. A $50 million charge revised the estimated cost of a mandatory deemed repatriation of non-U.S. earnings, including changes in the deferred tax liability related to the amount of earnings considered not indefinitely reinvested as well as the amount of unrecognized tax benefits and state tax liabilities associated with these tax positions. The impacts of U.S. tax reform on the financial statements were based on enacted law and related guidance received as of December 31, 2018. On January 15, 2019, the U.S. Treasury issued final regulations providing additional guidance related to the calculation of the mandatory deemed repatriation of non-U.S. earnings. We are currently evaluating the impact of these regulations and will recognize any resulting adjustments in the first quarter of 2019. As a result of U.S. tax reform legislation, distributions of profits from non-U.S. subsidiaries are not expected to cause a significant incremental U.S. tax impact in the future. However, these distributions may be subject to non-U.S. withholding taxes if profits are distributed from certain jurisdictions. Undistributed profits of non-U.S. subsidiaries of approximately $14 billion are considered indefinitely reinvested. Determination of the amount of unrecognized deferred tax liability related to indefinitely reinvested profits is not feasible primarily due to our legal entity structure and the complexity of U.S. and local tax laws. ##TABLE_START The components of profit (loss) before taxes were:         Years ended December 31, (Millions of dollars)    U.S.  $ 2,131  $  $ (2,053 ) Non-U.S.  5,691  3,842  2,192   $ 7,822  $ 4,082  $        ##TABLE_END Profit before taxes, as shown above, is based on the location of the entity to which such earnings are attributable.

In total, we have established a valuation allowance of $192 million related to certain of these carryforwards. At December 31, 2018, approximately $500 million of U.S. foreign tax credits were available for carryforward. These credits expire in 2028.

We recognized a net provision for interest and penalties of $42 million , $38 million and $34 million during the years ended December 31, 2018 , 2017 and 2016 , respectively. The total amount of interest and penalties accrued was $190 million and $157 million as of December 31, 2018 and 2017 , respectively.  On January 31, 2018, we received a Revenue Agent's Report from the IRS indicating the end of the field examination of our U.S. income tax returns for 2010 to 2012. In the audits of 2007 to 2012 including the impact of a loss carryback to 2005, the IRS has proposed to tax in the United States profits earned from certain parts transactions by Caterpillar SARL (CSARL), based on the IRS examination teams application of the substance-over-form or assignment-of-income judicial doctrines. We are vigorously contesting the proposed increases to tax and penalties for these years of approximately $2.3 billion . We believe that the relevant transactions complied with applicable tax laws and did not violate judicial doctrines. We have filed U.S. income tax returns on this same basis for years after 2012. Based on the information currently available, we do not anticipate a significant change to our unrecognized tax benefits for this position within the next 12 months. We currently believe the ultimate disposition of this matter will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position, liquidity or results of operations. With the exception of a loss carryback to 2005, tax years prior to 2007 are generally no longer subject to U.S. tax assessment. In our major non-U.S. jurisdictions including Australia, Brazil, China, Germany, Japan, Mexico, Switzerland, Singapore and the U.K., tax years are typically subject to examination for three to ten years . Due to the uncertainty related to the timing and potential outcome of audits, we cannot estimate the range of reasonably possible change in unrecognized tax benefits in the next 12 months. ##TABLE_START 7.

Accordingly, this presentation should not be regarded as a forecast of future cash collections. Please refer to Note 18 and Table III for fair value information.  ##TABLE_START C. Allowance for credit losses ##TABLE_END  The allowance for credit losses is an estimate of the losses inherent in Cat Financials finance receivable portfolio and includes consideration of accounts that have been individually identified as impaired, as well as pools of finance receivables where it is probable that certain receivables in the pool are impaired but the individual accounts cannot yet be identified. In identifying and measuring impairment, management takes into consideration past loss experience, known and inherent risks in the portfolio, adverse situations that may affect the borrowers ability to repay, estimated value of underlying collateral and current economic conditions. Accounts are identified for individual review based on past-due status and information available about the customer, such as financial statements, news reports and published credit ratings, as well as general information regarding industry trends and the economic environment in which Cat Financials customers operate. The allowance for credit losses attributable to finance receivables that are individually evaluated and determined to be impaired is based on the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the receivables' effective interest rate, the fair value of the collateral for collateral-dependent receivables or the observable market price of the receivable. In determining collateral value, Cat Financial estimates the current fair market value of the collateral less selling costs. Cat Financial also considers credit enhancements such as additional collateral and contractual third-party guarantees. The allowance for credit losses attributable to the remaining accounts not yet individually identified as impaired is estimated based on loss forecast models utilizing probabilities of default, our estimate of the loss emergence period and the estimated loss given default. In addition, qualitative factors not able to be fully captured in the loss forecast models including industry trends, macroeconomic factors and model imprecision are considered in the evaluation of the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses. These qualitative factors are subjective and require a degree of management judgment. Cat Financials allowance for credit losses is segregated into two portfolio segments:  ##TABLE_START  Customer - Finance receivables with end-user customers. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  Dealer - Finance receivables with Caterpillar dealers. ##TABLE_END A portfolio segment is the level at which the Company develops a systematic methodology for determining its allowance for credit losses.  Cat Financial further evaluates portfolio segments by the class of finance receivables, which is defined as a level of information (below a portfolio segment) in which the finance receivables have the same initial measurement attribute and a similar method for assessing and monitoring credit risk. Typically, Cat Financials finance receivables within a geographic area have similar credit risk profiles and methods for assessing and monitoring credit risk. Cat Financials classes, which align with management reporting for credit losses, are as follows:  ##TABLE_START  North America - Finance receivables originated in the United States and Canada. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  Europe - Finance receivables originated in Europe, Africa, Middle East and the Commonwealth of Independent States. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  Asia Pacific - Finance receivables originated in Australia, New Zealand, China, Japan, Southeast Asia and India. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  Mining - Finance receivables related to large mining customers worldwide and project financing in various countries. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  Latin America - Finance receivables originated in Mexico, Central and South American countries. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  Caterpillar Power Finance - Finance receivables related to marine vessels with Caterpillar engines worldwide and Caterpillar electrical power generation, gas compression and co-generation systems and non-Caterpillar equipment that is powered by these systems worldwide. ##TABLE_END An analysis of the allowance for credit losses was as follows: ##TABLE_START (Millions of dollars)  December 31, 2018   Customer  Dealer  Total Allowance for Credit Losses:       Balance at beginning of year  $  $  $ Receivables written off  (235 )    (235 ) Recoveries on receivables previously written off     Provision for credit losses    Other  (15 )    (15 ) Balance at end of year  $  $  $        Individually evaluated for impairment  $  $  $ Collectively evaluated for impairment    Ending Balance  $  $  $        Recorded Investment in Finance Receivables:       Individually evaluated for impairment  $  $  $ Collectively evaluated for impairment  18,152  3,338  21,490 Ending Balance  $ 19,010  $ 3,416  $ 22,426        ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START (Millions of dollars)  December 31, 2017   Customer  Dealer  Total Allowance for Credit Losses:       Balance at beginning of year  $  $  $ Receivables written off  (157 )    (157 ) Recoveries on receivables previously written off     Provision for credit losses   (1 )  Other     Balance at end of year  $  $  $        Individually evaluated for impairment  $  $   $ Collectively evaluated for impairment    Ending Balance  $  $  $        Recorded Investment in Finance Receivables:       Individually evaluated for impairment  $  $   $ Collectively evaluated for impairment  18,226  3,464  21,690 Ending Balance  $ 19,168  $ 3,464  $ 22,632        ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START        ##TABLE_ENDCredit quality of finance receivables  At origination, Cat Financial evaluates credit risk based on a variety of credit quality factors including prior payment experience, customer financial information, credit-rating agency ratings, loan-to-value ratios and other internal metrics. On an ongoing basis, Cat Financial monitors credit quality based on past-due status and collection experience as there is a meaningful correlation between the past-due status of customers and the risk of loss. In determining past-due status, Cat Financial considers the entire recorded investment in finance receivable past due when any installment is over 30 days past due.

See Note 24 for details on these acquisitions. Finite-lived intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives and tested for impairment if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset may be impaired. In 2016 , gross customer relationship intangibles of $96 million and related accumulated amortization of $27 million as well as gross intellectual property intangibles of $111 million and related accumulated amortization of $48 million from the Resource Industries segment were impaired. The fair value of these intangibles was determined to be insignificant based on an income approach using expected cash flows. The fair value determination is categorized as Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy due to its use of internal projections and unobservable measurement inputs. The total impairment of $132 million was a result of restructuring activities and is included in Other operating (income) expense in Statement 1. See Note 25 for information on restructuring costs. Amortization expense related to intangible assets was $331 million , $323 million and $326 million for 2018 , 2017 and 2016 , respectively. As of December 31, 2018 , amortization expense related to intangible assets is expected to be: ##TABLE_START (Millions of dollars)      Thereafter $  $  $  $  $  $            ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START B. Goodwill ##TABLE_END  In 2018, we acquired net assets with related goodwill of $127 million in the Energy  Transportation segment. We recorded goodwill of $109 million related to the acquisition of ECM S.p.A. and $18 million related to the acquisition of Downer Freight Rail. See Note 24 for details on these acquisitions. There were no goodwill impairments during 2018 or 2017 . The annual impairment test completed in the fourth quarter of 2016 indicated that the fair value of the Surface Mining  Technology reporting unit was below its carrying value requiring the second step of the goodwill impairment test process. The fair value of Surface Mining  Technology was determined primarily using an income approach based on a discounted ten year cash flow. We assigned the fair value to Surface Mining  Technologys assets and liabilities using various valuation techniques that required assumptions about royalty rates, dealer attrition, technological obsolescence and discount rates. The resulting implied fair value of goodwill was below the carrying value. Accordingly, we recognized a goodwill impairment charge of $595 million , which resulted in goodwill of $629 million remaining for Surface Mining  Technology as of October 1, 2016. The fair value determination is categorized as Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy due to its use of internal projections and unobservable measurement inputs. There was a $17 million tax benefit associated with this impairment charge. The changes in carrying amount of goodwill by reportable segment for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 were as follows: ##TABLE_START (Millions of dollars)  December 31, 2017  Acquisitions  Other Adjustments 1  December 31, 2018 Construction Industries         Goodwill  $  $   $ (1 )  $ Impairment  (22 )      (22 ) Net goodwill     (1 )  Resource Industries         Goodwill  4,232    (60 )  4,172 Impairment  (1,175 )      (1,175 ) Net goodwill  3,057    (60 )  2,997 Energy  Transportation         Goodwill  2,806   (51 )  2,882 All Other 2         Goodwill      Consolidated total         Goodwill  7,397   (110 )  7,414 Impairment  (1,197 )      (1,197 ) Net goodwill  $ 6,200  $  $ (110 )  $ 6,217            December 31, 2016  Acquisitions  Other Adjustments 1  December 31, 2017 Construction Industries         Goodwill  $  $   $  $ Impairment  (22 )      (22 ) Net goodwill      Resource Industries         Goodwill  4,110     4,232 Impairment  (1,175 )      (1,175 ) Net goodwill  2,935     3,057 Energy  Transportation         Goodwill  2,756     2,806 All Other 2         Goodwill     (1 )  Consolidated total         Goodwill  7,217     7,397 Impairment  (1,197 )      (1,197 ) Net goodwill  $ 6,020  $   $  $ 6,200 ##TABLE_END1 Other adjustments are comprised primarily of foreign currency translation. 2 Includes All Other operating segments (See Note 23). ##TABLE_START      ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START 11. Investments in debt and equity securities ##TABLE_END  We have investments in certain debt and equity securities, primarily at Insurance Services, which are recorded at fair value and are primarily included in Other assets in Statement 3. Debt securities have been classified as available-for-sale and the unrealized gains and losses arising from the revaluation of these debt securities are included, net of applicable deferred income taxes, in equity (Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in Statement 3). Realized gains and losses on sales of debt investments are generally determined using the specific identification method and are included in Other income (expense) in Statement 1. Beginning January 1, 2018, we adopted new accounting guidance issued by the FASB resulting in the unrealized gains and losses arising from the revaluation of these equity securities to be included in Other income (expense) in Statement 1. Prior to January 1, 2018, the unrealized gains and losses arising from revaluation of the available-for-sale equity securities and the Real Estate Investment Trust were included, net of applicable deferred income taxes, in equity (Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in Statement 3).

Postemployment benefit plans ##TABLE_END  We provide defined benefit pension plans, defined contribution plans and/or other postretirement benefit plans (retirement health care and life insurance) to employees in many of our locations throughout the world. Our defined benefit pension plans provide a benefit based on years of service and/or the employees average earnings near retirement. Our defined contribution plans allow employees to contribute a portion of their salary to help save for retirement, and in most cases, we provide a matching contribution. The benefit obligation related to our non-U.S. defined benefit pension plans are for employees located primarily in Europe, Japan and Brazil. For other postretirement benefits (OPEB), substantially all of our benefit obligation is for employees located in the United States.  Our U.S. defined benefit pension plans for support and management employees were frozen for certain employees on December 31, 2010, and will freeze for remaining employees on December 31, 2019. On the respective transition dates employees move to a retirement benefit that provides a frozen pension benefit and a 401(k) plan that will include a matching contribution and a new annual employer contribution. In the first quarter of 2017, we announced the closure of our Gosselies, Belgium facility. This announcement impacted certain employees that participated in a defined benefit pension plan and resulted in a net loss of $20 million in the first quarter of 2017 for curtailment and termination benefits. All curtailments and termination benefits were recognized in Other income (expense) in Statement 1. ##TABLE_START A.

The U.S. discount rate is based on a benefit cash flow-matching approach and represents the rate at which our benefit obligations could effectively be settled as of our measurement date, December 31. The benefit cash flow-matching approach involves analyzing Caterpillars projected cash flows against a high quality bond yield curve, calculated using a wide population of corporate Aa bonds available on the measurement date. A similar process is used to determine the assumed discount rate for our most significant non-U.S. plans. This rate is sensitive to changes in interest rates. A decrease in the discount rate would increase our obligation and future expense. ##TABLE_START B.

The current U.S. pension target asset allocation is 70 percent fixed income and 30 percent equities. This target allocation will be revisited periodically to ensure it reflects our overall objectives. The non-U.S. pension weighted-average target allocations are 78 percent fixed income, 13 percent equities, 5 percent real estate and 4 percent other. The target allocations for each plan vary based upon local statutory requirements, demographics of plan participants and funded status. The non-U.S. plan assets are primarily invested in non-U.S. securities.  Our target allocation for the other postretirement benefit plans is 70 percent equities and 30 percent fixed income.  The U.S. plans are rebalanced to within the appropriate target asset allocation ranges on a monthly basis. The frequency of rebalancing for the non-U.S. plans varies depending on the plan. As a result of our diversification strategies, there are no significant concentrations of risk within the portfolio of investments.  The use of certain derivative instruments is permitted where appropriate and necessary for achieving overall investment policy objectives. The plans do not engage in derivative contracts for speculative purposes.  The accounting guidance on fair value measurements specifies a fair value hierarchy based upon the observability of inputs used in valuation techniques (Level 1, 2 and 3). See Note 18 for a discussion of the fair value hierarchy.  Fair values are determined as follows:  ##TABLE_START  Equity securities are primarily based on valuations for identical instruments in active markets. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Fixed income securities are primarily based upon models that take into consideration such market-based factors as recent sales, risk-free yield curves and prices of similarly rated bonds. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Real estate is stated at the funds net asset value or at appraised value. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Cash, short-term instruments and other are based on the carrying amount, which approximates fair value, or the funds net asset value. ##TABLE_ENDThe fair value of the pension and other postretirement benefit plan assets by category is summarized below:  ##TABLE_START   December 31, 2018 (Millions of dollars)  Level 1  Level 2  Level 3  Measured at NAV  Total Assets at Fair Value U.S. Pension           Equity securities:           U.S. equities  $ 1,971  $   $  $  $ 2,161 Non-U.S. equities  1,279       1,280            Fixed income securities:           U.S. corporate bonds    6,371    6,484 Non-U.S. corporate bonds    1,332      1,332 U.S. government bonds         U.S. governmental agency mortgage-backed securities         Non-U.S. government bonds                    Real estate                    Cash, short-term instruments and other       Total U.S. pension assets  $ 3,452  $ 8,765  $  $  $ 12,697 ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START   December 31, 2017 (Millions of dollars)  Level 1  Level 2  Level 3  Measured at NAV  Total Assets at Fair Value U.S. Pension           Equity securities:           U.S. equities  $ 2,745  $   $  $  $ 2,930 Non-U.S. equities  1,573       1,588            Fixed income securities:           U.S. corporate bonds    5,886    5,995 Non-U.S. corporate bonds    1,165      1,165 U.S. government bonds         U.S. governmental agency mortgage-backed securities         Non-U.S. government bonds                    Real estate                    Cash, short-term instruments and other       Total U.S. pension assets  $ 4,491  $ 8,397  $  $  $ 13,416            ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START   December 31, 2018 (Millions of dollars)  Level 1  Level 2  Level 3  Measured at NAV  Total Assets at Fair Value Non-U.S. Pension           Equity securities:           U.S. equities  $  $   $   $   $ Non-U.S. equities        Global equities 1                   Fixed income securities:           U.S. corporate bonds         Non-U.S. corporate bonds        U.S. government bonds         Non-U.S. government bonds    1,721      1,721 Global fixed income 1                   Real estate                    Cash, short-term instruments and other 2        Total non-U.S. pension assets  $  $ 3,270  $   $  $ 4,025 ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START   December 31, 2017 (Millions of dollars)  Level 1  Level 2  Level 3  Measured at NAV  Total Assets at Fair Value Non-U.S. Pension           Equity securities:           U.S. equities  $  $   $   $  $ Non-U.S. equities       1,363 Global equities 1                   Fixed income securities:           U.S. corporate bonds         Non-U.S. corporate bonds       U.S. government bonds         Non-U.S. government bonds    1,229      1,229 Global fixed income 1                   Real estate                    Cash, short-term instruments and other 2        Total non-U.S. pension assets  $  $ 2,375  $  $ 1,290  $ 4,305 1 Includes funds that invest in both U.S. and non-U.S. securities. 2 Includes funds that invest in multiple asset classes, hedge funds and other.            ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START   December 31, 2018 (Millions of dollars)  Level 1  Level 2  Level 3  Measured at NAV  Total Assets at Fair Value Other Postretirement Benefits           Equity securities:           U.S. equities  $  $  $   $   $ Non-U.S. equities                    Fixed income securities:           U.S. corporate bonds         Non-U.S. corporate bonds         U.S. government bonds         U.S. governmental agency mortgage-backed securities         Non-U.S. government bonds                    Cash, short-term instruments and other       Total other postretirement benefit assets  $  $  $   $  $ ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START   December 31, 2017 (Millions of dollars)  Level 1  Level 2  Level 3  Measured at NAV  Total Assets at Fair Value Other Postretirement Benefits           Equity securities:           U.S. equities  $  $  $   $   $ Non-U.S. equities                    Fixed income securities:           U.S. corporate bonds        Non-U.S. corporate bonds         U.S. government bonds         U.S. governmental agency mortgage-backed securities         Non-U.S. government bonds                    Cash, short-term instruments and other        Total other postretirement benefit assets  $  $  $   $  $            ##TABLE_ENDBelow are roll-forwards of assets measured at fair value using Level 3 inputs for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 .

For pension plans in which all or almost all of the plan's participants are inactive and other postretirement benefit plans in which all or almost all of the plan's participants are fully eligible for benefits under the plan, prior service cost (credit) is amortized using the straight-line method over the remaining life expectancy of those participants. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START 3  Actuarial loss (gain) represents the effects of actual results differing from our assumptions and the effects of changing assumptions. We recognize actuarial loss (gain) immediately through earnings upon the annual remeasurement in the fourth quarter, or on an interim basis as triggering events warrant remeasurement. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START 4  The service cost component of net periodic pension and other postretirement benefits cost (benefit) is included in Operating costs in Statement 1. All other components of net periodic pension and other postretirement benefits cost (benefit) are included in Other income (expense) in Statement 1. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START 5  The weighted-average rates for 2019 are 5.9 percent and 3.8 percent for U.S. and non-U.S. pension plans, respectively. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START      ##TABLE_ENDThe discount rates used in the determination of our service and interest cost components are determined by utilizing a full yield curve approach which applies specific spot rates along the yield curve used in the determination of the benefit obligation to the relevant projected cash flows.  Our U.S. expected long-term rate of return on plan assets is based on our estimate of long-term passive returns for equities and fixed income securities weighted by the allocation of our pension assets. Based on historical performance, we increase the passive returns due to our active management of the plan assets. To arrive at our expected long-term return, the amount added for active management was 0.75 percent for 2018 , 0.80 percent for 2017 and 0.90 percent for 2016 . A similar process is used to determine this rate for our non-U.S. plans.  The assumed health care trend rate represents the rate at which health care costs are assumed to increase. We assumed a weighted-average increase of 6.1 percent in our calculation of 2018 benefit expense. We expect a weighted-average increase of 6.1 percent during 2019. The 2019 rates are assumed to decrease gradually to the ultimate health care trend rate of 5 percent in 2025 . This rate represents 3 percent general inflation plus 2 percent additional health care inflation. Assumed health care cost trend rates have a significant effect on the amounts reported for the health care plans. A one-percentage-point change in assumed health care cost trend rates would have had the following effects: ##TABLE_START (Millions of dollars)  One-percentage- point increase  One-percentage- point decrease Effect on 2018 service and interest cost components of other postretirement benefit cost  $  $ (11 ) Effect on accumulated postretirement benefit obligation  $  $ (117 ) ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START F. Other postemployment benefit plans ##TABLE_END  We offer long-term disability benefits, continued health care for disabled employees, survivor income benefit insurance and supplemental unemployment benefits to substantially all U.S. employees. ##TABLE_START G. Defined contribution plans ##TABLE_END  We have both U.S. and non-U.S. employee defined contribution plans to help employees save for retirement. Our primary U.S. 401(k) plan allows eligible employees to contribute a portion of their cash compensation to the plan on a tax-deferred basis. Employees with frozen defined benefit pension accruals are eligible for matching contributions equal to 100 percent of employee contributions to the plan up to 6 percent of cash compensation and an annual employer contribution that ranges from 3 to 5 percent of cash compensation (depending on years of service and age). Employees that are still accruing benefits under a defined benefit pension plan are eligible for matching contributions equal to 50 percent of employee contributions up to 6 percent of cash compensation. These 401(k) plans include various investment funds, including a non-leveraged employee stock ownership plan (ESOP). As of December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017 , the ESOP held 17.2 million and 17.7 million shares, respectively. All of the shares held by the ESOP were allocated to participant accounts. Dividends paid to participants are automatically reinvested into company shares unless the participant elects to have all or a portion of the dividend paid to the participant. Various other U.S. and non-U.S. defined contribution plans generally allow eligible employees to contribute a portion of their cash compensation to the plans, and in most cases, we provide a matching contribution to the funds.

Information on our Credit Facility is as follows:  ##TABLE_START  The 364 -day facility of $3.15 billion (of which $0.82 billion is available to MET) expires in September 2019. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  The three -year facility, as amended and restated in September 2018, of $2.73 billion (of which $0.72 billion is available to MET) expires in September 2021. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  The five -year facility, as amended and restated in September 2018, of $4.62 billion (of which $1.21 billion is available to MET) expires in September 2023. ##TABLE_END Other consolidated credit lines with banks as of December 31, 2018 totaled $4.58 billion . These committed and uncommitted credit lines, which may be eligible for renewal at various future dates or have no specified expiration date, are used primarily by our subsidiaries for local funding requirements. Caterpillar or Cat Financial may guarantee subsidiary borrowings under these lines. At December 31, 2018 , Caterpillar's consolidated net worth was $14.07 billion , which was above the $9.00 billion required under the Credit Facility. The consolidated net worth is defined as the consolidated shareholder's equity including preferred stock but excluding the pension and other postretirement benefits balance within Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). At December 31, 2018 , Cat Financial's covenant interest coverage ratio was 1.56 to 1 . This is above the 1.15 to 1 minimum ratio, calculated as (1) profit excluding income taxes, interest expense and net gain/(loss) from interest rate derivatives to (2) interest expense calculated at the end of each calendar quarter for the rolling four quarter period then most recently ended, required by the Credit Facility. In addition, at December 31, 2018 , Cat Financial's six-month covenant leverage ratio was 7.69 to 1 and year-end covenant leverage ratio was 8.33 to 1 . This is below the maximum ratio of debt to net worth of 10 to 1 , calculated (1) on a monthly basis as the average of the leverage ratios determined on the last day of each of the six preceding calendar months and (2) at each December 31, required by the Credit Facility. In the event Caterpillar or Cat Financial does not meet one or more of their respective financial covenants under the Credit Facility in the future (and are unable to obtain a consent or waiver), the syndicate of banks may terminate the commitments allocated to the party that does not meet its covenants. Additionally, in such event, certain of Cat Financial's other lenders under other loan agreements where similar financial covenants or cross default provisions are applicable, may, at their election, choose to pursue remedies under those loan agreements, including accelerating the repayment of outstanding borrowings. At December 31, 2018 , there were no borrowings under the Credit Facility.  ##TABLE_START 16.

For 2017, no outstanding SARs and stock options were excluded from the computation of diluted earnings per share because all outstanding SARs and stock options had a dilutive effect. SARs and stock options to purchase 32.1 million common shares were outstanding in 2016 , which were not included in the computation of diluted earnings per share because the effect would have been antidilutive. In January 2014, the Board of Directors approved an authorization to repurchase up to $10.0 billion of Caterpillar common stock, which expired on December 31, 2018. In July 2018, the Board approved a new share repurchase authorization of up to $10.0 billion of Caterpillar common stock effective January 1, 2019, with no expiration. During 2018, we repurchased 27.7 million shares of Caterpillar common stock at an aggregate cost of $3.8 billion . These purchases were made through a combination of accelerated stock repurchase agreements with third-party financial institutions and open market transactions.  We did not purchase any Caterpillar common stock during 2017 or 2016.  ##TABLE_START 17.

Fair value measurements ##TABLE_END  The guidance on fair value measurements defines fair value as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants. This guidance also specifies a fair value hierarchy based upon the observability of inputs used in valuation techniques. Observable inputs (highest level) reflect market data obtained from independent sources, while unobservable inputs (lowest level) reflect internally developed market assumptions. In accordance with this guidance, fair value measurements are classified under the following hierarchy:  ##TABLE_START  Level 1   Quoted prices for identical instruments in active markets. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  Level 2  Quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active; and model-derived valuations in which all significant inputs or significant value-drivers are observable in active markets. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  Level 3  Model-derived valuations in which one or more significant inputs or significant value-drivers are unobservable. ##TABLE_END  When available, we use quoted market prices to determine fair value, and we classify such measurements within Level 1. In some cases where market prices are not available, we make use of observable market based inputs to calculate fair value, in which case the measurements are classified within Level 2. If quoted or observable market prices are not available, fair value is based upon valuations in which one or more significant inputs are unobservable, including internally developed models that use, where possible, current market-based parameters such as interest rates, yield curves and currency rates. These measurements are classified within Level 3. Fair value measurements are classified according to the lowest level input or value-driver that is significant to the valuation. A measurement may therefore be classified within Level 3 even though there may be significant inputs that are readily observable.  Fair value measurement includes the consideration of nonperformance risk. Nonperformance risk refers to the risk that an obligation (either by a counterparty or Caterpillar) will not be fulfilled. For financial assets traded in an active market (Level 1 and certain Level 2), the nonperformance risk is included in the market price. For certain other financial assets and liabilities (certain Level 2 and Level 3), our fair value calculations have been adjusted accordingly.  Investments in debt and equity securities We have investments in certain debt and equity securities, primarily at Insurance Services, that are recorded at fair value. Fair values for our U.S. treasury bonds and large capitalization value and smaller company growth equity securities are based upon valuations for identical instruments in active markets. Fair values for other government bonds, corporate bonds and mortgage-backed debt securities are based upon models that take into consideration such market-based factors as recent sales, risk-free yield curves and prices of similarly rated bonds.  In addition, Insurance Services has an equity investment in a real estate investment trust (REIT) which is recorded at fair value based on the net asset value (NAV) of the investment. Beginning January 1, 2018, we adopted new accounting guidance issued by the FASB which resulted in the fair value of the REIT no longer being classified within the fair value hierarchy. Prior to January 1, 2018, the fair value was classified as Level 3. See Note 11 for additional information on our investments in debt and equity securities.  Derivative financial instruments The fair value of interest rate contracts is primarily based on models that utilize the appropriate market-based forward swap curves and zero-coupon interest rates to determine discounted cash flows. The fair value of foreign currency and commodity forward, option and cross currency contracts is based on a valuation model that discounts cash flows resulting from the differential between the contract price and the market-based forward rate. Assets and liabilities measured on a recurring basis at fair value, primarily related to Financial Products, included in Statement 3 as of December 31, 2018 and 2017 are summarized below: ##TABLE_START   December 31, 2018 (Millions of dollars)  Level 1  Level 2  Level 3  Measured at NAV  Total Assets / Liabilities, at Fair Value Assets           Debt securities           Government debt           U.S. treasury bonds  $  $   $   $   $ Other U.S. and non-U.S. government bonds                    Corporate bonds           Corporate bonds         Asset-backed securities                    Mortgage-backed debt securities           U.S. governmental agency         Residential         Commercial         Total debt securities   1,142      1,151 Equity securities           Large capitalization value         Smaller company growth         REIT         Total equity securities                   Total Assets  $  $ 1,142  $   $  $ 1,576            Liabilities           Derivative financial instruments, net  $   $  $   $   $ Total Liabilities  $   $  $   $   $            ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START   December 31, 2017 (Millions of dollars)  Level 1  Level 2  Level 3  Total Assets / Liabilities, at Fair Value Assets         Debt securities         Government debt         U.S. treasury bonds  $  $   $   $ Other U.S. and non-U.S. government bonds                Corporate bonds         Corporate bonds       Asset-backed securities                Mortgage-backed debt securities         U.S. governmental agency       Residential       Commercial       Total debt securities      Equity securities         Large capitalization value       Smaller company growth       REIT       Total equity securities      Total Assets  $  $  $  $ 1,439          Liabilities         Derivative financial instruments, net  $   $  $   $ Total Liabilities  $   $  $   $          ##TABLE_ENDIn addition to the amounts above, Cat Financial impaired loans are subject to measurement at fair value on a nonrecurring basis and are classified as Level 3 measurements. A loan is considered impaired when management determines that collection of contractual amounts due is not probable. In these cases, an allowance for credit losses may be established based either on the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the receivables' effective interest rate, the fair value of the collateral for collateral-dependent receivables, or the observable market price of the receivable. In determining collateral value, Cat Financial estimates the current fair market value of the collateral less selling costs. Cat Financial had impaired loans with a fair value of $469 million and $341 million for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 , respectively.  ##TABLE_START B. Fair values of financial instruments ##TABLE_END  In addition to the methods and assumptions we use to record the fair value of financial instruments as discussed in the Fair value measurements section above, we used the following methods and assumptions to estimate the fair value of our financial instruments:  Cash and short-term investments Carrying amount approximated fair value.  Restricted cash and short-term investments Carrying amount approximated fair value. Restricted cash and short-term investments are included in prepaid expenses and other current assets in Statement 3.  Finance receivables Fair value was estimated by discounting the future cash flows using current rates, representative of receivables with similar remaining maturities.  Wholesale inventory receivables Fair value was estimated by discounting the future cash flows using current rates, representative of receivables with similar remaining maturities.  Short-term borrowings Carrying amount approximated fair value.  Long-term debt Fair value for fixed and floating rate debt was estimated based on quoted market prices. Guarantees The fair value of guarantees is based upon our estimate of the premium a market participant would require to issue the same guarantee in a stand-alone arms-length transaction with an unrelated party. If quoted or observable market prices are not available, fair value is based upon internally developed models that utilize current market-based assumptions.  Please refer to the table below for the fair values of our financial instruments.  ##TABLE_START TABLE IIIFair Values of Financial Instruments        (Millions of dollars)  Carrying Amount  Fair Value  Carrying Amount  Fair Value  Fair Value Levels  Reference Assets at December 31,             Cash and short-term investments  $ 7,857  $ 7,857  $ 8,261  $ 8,261   Statement 3 Restricted cash and short-term investments       Statement 3 Investments in debt and equity securities  1,576  1,576  1,439  1,439  1, 2  3  Notes 11  19 Finance receivablesnet (excluding finance leases 1 )  14,714  14,798  15,452  15,438   Notes 7  19 Wholesale inventory receivablesnet (excluding finance leases 1 )  1,050  1,025  1,153  1,123   Notes 7  19 Foreign currency contractsnet         Notes 4  19 Interest rate swapsnet         Notes 4  19 Commodity contractsnet         Notes 4  19              Liabilities at December 31,             Short-term borrowings  5,723  5,723  4,837  4,837   Note 13 Long-term debt (including amounts due within one year):             Machinery, Energy  Transportation  8,015  9,046  7,935  9,863   Note 14 Financial Products  22,815  22,684  22,106  22,230   Note 14 Foreign currency contractsnet         Notes 4  19 Interest rate swapsnet         Notes 4  19 Commodity contractsnet         Notes 4  19 Guarantees       Note 21 ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START 1  Total excluded items have a net carrying value at December 31, 2018 and 2017 of $7,463 million and $7,063 million , respectively. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START      ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START 19. Concentration of credit risk ##TABLE_END  Financial instruments with potential credit risk consist primarily of trade and finance receivables and short-term and long-term investments. Additionally, to a lesser extent, we have a potential credit risk associated with counterparties to derivative contracts.  Trade receivables are primarily short-term receivables from independently owned and operated dealers and customers which arise in the normal course of business. We perform regular credit evaluations of our dealers and customers. Collateral generally is not required, and the majority of our trade receivables are unsecured. We do, however, when deemed necessary, make use of various devices such as security agreements and letters of credit to protect our interests. No single dealer or customer represents a significant concentration of credit risk.  Finance receivables and wholesale inventory receivables primarily represent receivables under installment sales contracts, receivables arising from leasing transactions and notes receivable. We generally maintain a secured interest in the equipment financed. No single customer or dealer represents a significant concentration of credit risk.  Short-term and long-term investments are held with high quality institutions and, by policy, the amount of credit exposure to any one institution is limited. Long-term investments, primarily included in Other assets in Statement 3, are comprised primarily of available-for-sale debt securities and equity securities at Insurance Services.  For derivative contracts, collateral is generally not required of the counterparties or of our company. The company generally enters into International Swaps and Derivatives Association (ISDA) master netting agreements within Machinery, Energy  Transportation and Financial Products that permit the net settlement of amounts owed under their respective derivative contracts. Our exposure to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the counterparties is limited to only those gains that we have recorded, but for which we have not yet received cash payment. The master netting agreements reduce the amount of loss the company would incur should the counterparties fail to meet their obligations. At December 31, 2018 and 2017 , the maximum exposure to credit loss was $131 million and $74 million , respectively, before the application of any master netting agreements. Please refer to Note 18 and Table III above for fair value information.  ##TABLE_START 20. Operating leases ##TABLE_END  We lease certain property, information technology equipment, warehouse equipment, vehicles and other equipment through operating leases. Total rental expense for operating leases was $322 million , $331 million and $375 million for 2018 , 2017 and 2016 , respectively.  Minimum payments for operating leases having initial or remaining non-cancelable terms in excess of one year are:  ##TABLE_START Years ended December 31, (Millions of dollars)      Thereafter  Total $  $  $  $  $  $  $              ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START 21. Guarantees and product warranty ##TABLE_END  Caterpillar dealer performance guarantees We have provided an indemnity to a third-party insurance company for potential losses related to performance bonds issued on behalf of Caterpillar dealers. The bonds have varying terms and are issued to insure governmental agencies against nonperformance by certain dealers. We also provided guarantees to third-parties related to the performance of contractual obligations by certain Caterpillar dealers. These guarantees have varying terms and cover potential financial losses incurred by the third-parties resulting from the dealers nonperformance. In 2016, we provided a guarantee to an end user related to the performance of contractual obligations by a Caterpillar dealer. Under the guarantee, which expires in 2025, non-performance by the Caterpillar dealer could require Caterpillar to satisfy the contractual obligations by providing goods, services or financial compensation to the end user up to an annual designated cap.  Customer loan guarantees We provide loan guarantees to third-party lenders for financing associated with machinery purchased by customers. These guarantees have varying terms and are secured by the machinery. In addition, Cat Financial participates in standby letters of credit issued to third parties on behalf of their customers. These standby letters of credit have varying terms and beneficiaries and are secured by customer assets. Supplier consortium performance guarantees We have provided guarantees to a customer in Brazil and a customer in Europe related to the performance of contractual obligations by supplier consortiums to which our Caterpillar subsidiaries are members. The guarantees cover potential damages incurred by the customers resulting from the supplier consortiums' non-performance. The damages are capped except for failure of the consortiums to meet certain obligations outlined in the contract in the normal course of business. The guarantees will expire when the supplier consortiums perform all their contractual obligations, which are expected to be completed in 2022 for the customer in Europe and 2025 for the customer in Brazil. Third party logistics business lease guarantees We have provided guarantees to third-party lessors for certain properties leased by a third party logistics business, formerly Caterpillar Logistics Services LCC, in which we sold our equity interest in 2015. The guarantees are for the possibility that the third party logistics business would default on real estate lease payments. The guarantees were granted at lease inception and generally will expire at the end of the lease terms. We have dealer performance guarantees and third party performance guarantees that do not limit potential payment to end users related to indemnities and other commercial contractual obligations. In addition, we have entered into contracts involving industry standard indemnifications that do not limit potential payment. For these unlimited guarantees, we are unable to estimate a maximum potential amount of future payments that could result from claims made. No significant loss has been experienced or is anticipated under any of these guarantees. At both December 31, 2018 and 2017 , the related liability was $8 million . The maximum potential amount of future payments (undiscounted and without reduction for any amounts that may possibly be recovered under recourse or collateralized provisions) we could be required to make under the guarantees at December 31 are as follows:  ##TABLE_START (Millions of dollars)   Caterpillar dealer performance guarantees  $ 1,244  $ 1,313 Customer loan guarantees   Supplier consortium performance guarantees   Third party logistics business lease guarantees   Other guarantees   Total guarantees  $ 1,978  $ 2,105      ##TABLE_END Cat Financial provides guarantees to repurchase certain loans of Caterpillar dealers from a special-purpose corporation (SPC) that qualifies as a variable interest entity. The purpose of the SPC is to provide short-term working capital loans to Caterpillar dealers. This SPC issues commercial paper and uses the proceeds to fund its loan program. Cat Financial has a loan purchase agreement with the SPC that obligates Cat Financial to purchase certain loans that are not paid at maturity. Cat Financial receives a fee for providing this guarantee, which provides a source of liquidity for the SPC. Cat Financial is the primary beneficiary of the SPC as its guarantees result in Cat Financial having both the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the SPCs economic performance and the obligation to absorb losses, and therefore Cat Financial has consolidated the financial statements of the SPC. As of December 31, 2018 and 2017 , the SPCs assets of $1,149 million and $1,107 million , respectively, were primarily comprised of loans to dealers, and the SPCs liabilities of $1,148 million and $1,106 million , respectively, were primarily comprised of commercial paper. The assets of the SPC are not available to pay Cat Financial's creditors. Cat Financial may be obligated to perform under the guarantee if the SPC experiences losses. No loss has been experienced or is anticipated under this loan purchase agreement.  Cat Financial is party to agreements in the normal course of business with selected customers and Caterpillar dealers in which they commit to provide a set dollar amount of financing on a pre-approved basis. They also provide lines of credit to certain customers and Caterpillar dealers, of which a portion remains unused as of the end of the period. Commitments and lines of credit generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses. It has been Cat Financial's experience that not all commitments and lines of credit will be used. Management applies the same credit policies when making commitments and granting lines of credit as it does for any other financing.  Cat Financial does not require collateral for these commitments/lines, but if credit is extended, collateral may be required upon funding. The amount of the unused commitments and lines of credit for dealers as of December 31, 2018 and 2017 was $11,853 million and $10,933 million , respectively. The amount of the unused commitments for customers as of December 31, 2018 and 2017 was $815 million and $715 million , respectively.  Our product warranty liability is determined by applying historical claim rate experience to the current field population and dealer inventory. Generally, historical claim rates are based on actual warranty experience for each product by machine model/engine size by customer or dealer location (inside or outside North America). Specific rates are developed for each product shipment month and are updated monthly based on actual warranty claim experience.  ##TABLE_START (Millions of dollars)    Warranty liability, January 1  $ 1,419  $ 1,258  Reduction in liability (payments)  (783 )  (860 )  Increase in liability (new warranties)   1,021  Warranty liability, December 31  $ 1,391  $ 1,419        ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START      ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START 22. Environmental and legal matters ##TABLE_END The Company is regulated by federal, state and international environmental laws governing our use, transport and disposal of substances and control of emissions. In addition to governing our manufacturing and other operations, these laws often impact the development of our products, including, but not limited to, required compliance with air emissions standards applicable to internal combustion engines. We have made, and will continue to make, significant research and development and capital expenditures to comply with these emissions standards. We are engaged in remedial activities at a number of locations, often with other companies, pursuant to federal and state laws. When it is probable we will pay remedial costs at a site, and those costs can be reasonably estimated, the investigation, remediation, and operating and maintenance costs are accrued against our earnings. Costs are accrued based on consideration of currently available data and information with respect to each individual site, including available technologies, current applicable laws and regulations, and prior remediation experience. Where no amount within a range of estimates is more likely, we accrue the minimum. Where multiple potentially responsible parties are involved, we consider our proportionate share of the probable costs. In formulating the estimate of probable costs, we do not consider amounts expected to be recovered from insurance companies or others. We reassess these accrued amounts on a quarterly basis. The amount recorded for environmental remediation is not material and is included in Accrued expenses. We believe there is no more than a remote chance that a material amount for remedial activities at any individual site, or at all the sites in the aggregate, will be required. On January 7, 2015, the Company received a grand jury subpoena from the U.S. District Court for the Central District of Illinois. The subpoena requests documents and information from the Company relating to, among other things, financial information concerning U.S. and non-U.S. Caterpillar subsidiaries (including undistributed profits of non-U.S. subsidiaries and the movement of cash among U.S. and non-U.S. subsidiaries). The Company has received additional subpoenas relating to this investigation requesting additional documents and information relating to, among other things, the purchase and resale of replacement parts by Caterpillar Inc. and non-U.S. Caterpillar subsidiaries, dividend distributions of certain non-U.S. Caterpillar subsidiaries, and Caterpillar SARL and related structures. On March 2-3, 2017, agents with the Department of Commerce, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and the Internal Revenue Service executed search and seizure warrants at three facilities of the Company in the Peoria, Illinois area, including its former corporate headquarters. The warrants identify, and agents seized, documents and information related to, among other things, the export of products from the United States, the movement of products between the United States and Switzerland, the relationship between Caterpillar Inc. and Caterpillar SARL, and sales outside the United States. It is the Companys understanding that the warrants, which concern both tax and export activities, are related to the ongoing grand jury investigation. The Company is continuing to cooperate with this investigation. The Company is unable to predict the outcome or reasonably estimate any potential loss; however, we currently believe that this matter will not have a material adverse effect on the Companys consolidated results of operations, financial position or liquidity. On March 20, 2014, Brazils Administrative Council for Economic Defense (CADE) published a Technical Opinion which named 18 companies and over 100 individuals as defendants, including two subsidiaries of Caterpillar Inc., MGE - Equipamentos e Servios Ferrovirios Ltda. (MGE) and Caterpillar Brasil Ltda. The publication of the Technical Opinion opened CADE's official administrative investigation into allegations that the defendants participated in anticompetitive bid activity for the construction and maintenance of metro and train networks in Brazil. While companies cannot be held criminally liable for anticompetitive conduct in Brazil, criminal charges have been brought against two current employees of MGE and one former employee of MGE involving the same conduct alleged by CADE. The Company has responded to all requests for information from the authorities. The Company is unable to predict the outcome or reasonably estimate the potential loss; however, we currently believe that this matter will not have a material adverse effect on the Company's consolidated results of operations, financial position or liquidity. In addition, we are involved in other unresolved legal actions that arise in the normal course of business. The most prevalent of these unresolved actions involve disputes related to product design, manufacture and performance liability (including claimed asbestos and welding fumes exposure), contracts, employment issues, environmental matters, intellectual property rights, taxes (other than income taxes) and securities laws. The aggregate range of reasonably possible losses in excess of accrued liabilities, if any, associated with these unresolved legal actions is not material. In some cases, we cannot reasonably estimate a range of loss because there is insufficient information regarding the matter. However, we believe there is no more than a remote chance that any liability arising from these matters would be material. Although it is not possible to predict with certainty the outcome of these unresolved legal actions, we believe that these actions will not individually or in the aggregate have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations, financial position or liquidity. ##TABLE_START 23. Segment information ##TABLE_END  ##TABLE_START A. Basis for segment information ##TABLE_END  Our Executive Office is comprised of a Chief Executive Officer (CEO), four Group Presidents, a Chief Financial Officer (CFO), a General Counsel  Corporate Secretary and a Chief Human Resources Officer. The Group Presidents and CFO are accountable for a related set of end-to-end businesses that they manage. The General Counsel  Corporate Secretary leads the Law, Security and Public Policy Division. The Chief Human Resources Officer leads the Human Resources Organization. The CEO allocates resources and manages performance at the Group President/CFO level. As such, the CEO serves as our Chief Operating Decision Maker and operating segments are primarily based on the Group President/CFO reporting structure.  Three of our operating segments, Construction Industries, Resource Industries and Energy  Transportation are led by Group Presidents. One operating segment, Financial Products, is led by the CFO who also has responsibility for Corporate Services. Corporate Services is a cost center primarily responsible for the performance of certain support functions globally and to provide centralized services; it does not meet the definition of an operating segment. One Group President leads two smaller operating segments that are included in the All Other operating segments. The Law, Security and Public Policy Division and the Human Resources Organization are cost centers and do not meet the definition of an operating segment. Segment information for 2017 and 2016 has been recast due to our adoption of new accounting guidance issued by the FASB related to the presentation of net periodic pension costs and net periodic postretirement benefit costs. Prior service cost (credits) is no longer included in segment profit. See Note 1J for additional information.  B.  Description of segments  We have six operating segments, of which four are reportable segments. Following is a brief description of our reportable segments and the business activities included in the All Other operating segments:  Construction Industries : A segment primarily responsible for supporting customers using machinery in infrastructure, forestry and building construction applications. Responsibilities include business strategy, product design, product management and development, manufacturing, marketing and sales and product support. The product portfolio includes asphalt pavers, backhoe loaders, compactors, cold planers, compact track and multi-terrain loaders, mini, small, medium and large track excavators, forestry excavators, feller bunchers, harvesters, knuckleboom loaders, motor graders, pipelayers, road reclaimers, site prep tractors, skidders, skid steer loaders, telehandlers, small and medium track-type tractors, track-type loaders, utility vehicles, wheel excavators, compact, small and medium wheel loaders and related parts and work tools. Inter-segment sales are a source of revenue for this segment. Resource Industries :  A segment primarily responsible for supporting customers using machinery in mining, quarry and aggregates, waste and material handling applications. Responsibilities include business strategy, product design, product management and development, manufacturing, marketing and sales and product support. The product portfolio includes large track-type tractors, large mining trucks, hard rock vehicles, longwall miners, electric rope shovels, draglines, hydraulic shovels, rotary drills, large wheel loaders, off-highway trucks, articulated trucks, wheel tractor scrapers, wheel dozers, landfill compactors, soil compactors, hard rock continuous mining systems, select work tools, machinery components, electronics and control systems and related parts. In addition to equipment, Resource Industries also develops and sells technology products and services to provide customers fleet management, equipment management analytics and autonomous machine capabilities. Resource Industries also manages areas that provide services to other parts of the company, including integrated manufacturing and research and development. Inter-segment sales are a source of revenue for this segment. Energy  Transportation : A segment primarily responsible for supporting customers using reciprocating engines, turbines, diesel-electric locomotives and related parts across industries serving Oil and Gas, Power Generation, Industrial and Transportation applications, including marine and rail-related businesses. Responsibilities include business strategy, product design, product management and development, manufacturing, marketing and sales and product support of turbine machinery and integrated systems and solutions and turbine-related services, reciprocating engine-powered generator sets, integrated systems used in the electric power generation industry, reciprocating engines and integrated systems and solutions for the marine and oil and gas industries; reciprocating engines supplied to the industrial industry as well as Cat machinery; the remanufacturing of Caterpillar engines and components and remanufacturing services for other companies; the business strategy, product design, product management and development, manufacturing, remanufacturing, leasing and service of diesel-electric locomotives and components and other rail-related products and services and product support of on-highway vocational trucks for North America. Inter-segment sales are a source of revenue for this segment.  Financial Products Segment : Provides financing alternatives to customers and dealers around the world for Caterpillar products, as well as financing for vehicles, power generation facilities and marine vessels that, in most cases, incorporate Caterpillar products. Financing plans include operating and finance leases, installment sale contracts, working capital loans and wholesale financing plans. The segment also provides insurance and risk management products and services that help customers and dealers manage their business risk. Insurance and risk management products offered include physical damage insurance, inventory protection plans, extended service coverage for machines and engines, and dealer property and casualty insurance. The various forms of financing, insurance and risk management products offered to customers and dealers help support the purchase and lease of our equipment. The segment also earns revenues from Machinery, Energy  Transportation, but the related costs are not allocated to operating segments.  All Other operating segments :  Primarily includes activities such as: business strategy, product management and development, manufacturing of filters and fluids, undercarriage, ground engaging tools, fluid transfer products, precision seals, rubber sealing and connecting components primarily for Cat products; parts distribution; integrated logistics solutions, distribution services responsible for dealer development and administration including a wholly owned dealer in Japan, dealer portfolio management and ensuring the most efficient and effective distribution of machines, engines and parts; digital investments for new customer and dealer solutions that integrate data analytics with state-of-the-art digital technologies while transforming the buying experience. Results for the All Other operating segments are included as a reconciling item between reportable segments and consolidated external reporting.  C.  Segment measurement and reconciliations  There are several methodology differences between our segment reporting and our external reporting. The following is a list of the more significant methodology differences:  ##TABLE_START  Machinery, Energy  Transportation segment net assets generally include inventories, receivables, property, plant and equipment, goodwill, intangibles, accounts payable and customer advances. Liabilities other than accounts payable and customer advances are generally managed at the corporate level and are not included in segment operations. Financial Products Segment assets generally include all categories of assets. ##TABLE_END  ##TABLE_START  Segment inventories and cost of sales are valued using a current cost methodology. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  Goodwill allocated to segments is amortized using a fixed amount based on a 20 year useful life. This methodology difference only impacts segment assets; no goodwill amortization expense is included in segment profit. In addition, only a portion of goodwill for certain acquisitions made in 2011 or later has been allocated to segments. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  The present value of future lease payments for certain Machinery, Energy  Transportation operating leases is included in segment assets. The estimated financing component of the lease payments is excluded. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  Currency exposures for Machinery, Energy  Transportation are generally managed at the corporate level and the effects of changes in exchange rates on results of operations within the year are not included in segment profit. The net difference created in the translation of revenues and costs between exchange rates used for U.S. GAAP reporting and exchange rates used for segment reporting is reported as a methodology difference. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  Stock-based compensation expense is not included in segment profit. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  Postretirement benefit expenses are split; segments are generally responsible for service costs, with the remaining elements of net periodic benefit cost included as a methodology difference. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  Machinery, Energy  Transportation segment profit is determined on a pretax basis and excludes interest expense and most other income/expense items. Financial Products Segment profit is determined on a pretax basis and includes other income/expense items. ##TABLE_END Reconciling items are created based on accounting differences between segment reporting and our consolidated external reporting. Please refer to pages 141 to 146 for financial information regarding significant reconciling items. Most of our reconciling items are self-explanatory given the above explanations. For the reconciliation of profit, we have grouped the reconciling items as follows:  ##TABLE_START  Corporate costs: These costs are related to corporate requirements primarily for compliance and legal functions for the benefit of the entire organization. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  Restructuring costs: Primarily costs for employee separation, long-lived asset impairments and contract terminations. These costs are included in Other operating (income) expenses except for defined-benefit plan curtailment losses and special termination benefits, which are included in Other income (expense). Restructuring costs also include other exit-related costs primarily for accelerated depreciation, inventory write-downs, equipment relocation and project management costs and LIFO inventory decrement benefits from inventory liquidations at closed facilities, all of which are primarily included in Cost of goods sold. A table, Reconciliation of Restructuring costs on page 143, has been included to illustrate how segment profit would have been impacted by the restructuring costs. See Note 25 for more information. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  Methodology differences: See previous discussion of significant accounting differences between segment reporting and consolidated external reporting. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  Timing: Timing differences in the recognition of costs between segment reporting and consolidated external reporting. For example, certain costs are reported on the cash basis for segment reporting and the accrual basis for consolidated external reporting. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START Segment Information (Millions of

On January 2, 2018, we acquired 100 percent of the equity in privately held ECM S.p.A. (ECM). Headquartered in Pistoia, Italy, ECM designs, manufactures, sells and services advanced signal systems for the rail industry. The ECM acquisition was executed to expand our presence in the international freight and transit industries through a combination of broad product offerings and strong reputation in the signaling market. The purchase price for the acquisition was $225 million , consisting of $249 million paid at closing, net of $25 million of cash acquired and $1 million of debt assumed. The transaction was financed with available cash. Tangible assets as of the acquisition date were $109 million , recorded at their fair values, and primarily included cash of $25 million , receivables of $28 million , inventories of $29 million , and property, plant and equipment of $17 million . Finite-lived intangible assets acquired of $112 million included customer relationships, developed technology and trade names. The finite lived intangible assets are being amortized on a straight-line basis over a weighted-average amortization period of approximately 13 years . Liabilities assumed as of the acquisition date were $79 million , recorded at their fair values, and primarily included accounts payable of $38 million and net deferred tax liabilities of $29 million . Goodwill of $109 million , non-deductible for income tax purposes, represented the excess of the consideration transferred over the net assets recognized and represented the estimated future economic benefits arising from other assets acquired that could not be individually identified and separately recognized. Factors that contributed to a purchase price resulting in the recognition of goodwill include ECMs strategic fit into our rail product portfolio, the opportunity to provide a complete line-up of signaling and train control systems and the acquired assembled workforce. The results of the acquired business for the period from the acquisition date are included in the accompanying consolidated financial statements and reported in the Energy  Transportation segment in Note 23. Assuming this transaction had been made at the beginning of any period presented, the consolidated pro forma results would not be materially different from reported results. Downer Freight Rail On January 2, 2018, we completed the acquisition of certain assets and liabilities of the Downer Freight Rail business (Downer Freight Rail). Headquartered in North Ryde, Australia, Downer Freight Rail provides a full suite of rolling stock, aftermarket parts and services throughout Australia. The acquisition was executed to strengthen our existing Rail footprint in Australia, which currently includes rolling stock maintenance facilities, as well as infrastructure and signaling facilities. The purchase price for the acquisition was $97 million . The transaction was financed with available cash. Tangible assets as of the acquisition date were $86 million , recorded at their fair values, and primarily included receivables of $23 million , inventories of $40 million , and property, plant and equipment of $15 million . Finite-lived customer relationship intangible assets acquired were $6 million . The finite lived intangible assets are being amortized on a straight-line basis over an amortization period of 15 years . Liabilities assumed as of the acquisition date were $14 million , which represented their fair values. Goodwill of $18 million , not expected to be deducted for income tax purposes, represented the excess of the consideration transferred over the net assets recognized and represented the estimated future economic benefits arising from other assets acquired that could not be individually identified and separately recognized. Factors that contributed to a purchase price resulting in the recognition of goodwill include Downer Freight Rails strategic fit into our rail product portfolio, the opportunity to expand our aftermarket parts and maintenance service portfolio in Australia and the acquired assembled workforce. The results of the acquired business for the period from the acquisition date are included in the accompanying consolidated financial statements and reported in the Energy  Transportation segment in Note 23. Assuming this transaction had been made at the beginning of any period presented, the consolidated pro forma results would not be materially different from reported results. Kemper Valve  Fittings Corp. On December 15, 2016, we acquired 100 percent of the equity in privately held Kemper Valve  Fittings Corp. (Kemper). Kemper is headquartered in Island Lake, Illinois and designs, manufactures, sells, and services high pressure flow iron to the well service segment of the Oil  Gas industry. This acquisition provides Caterpillar with a new product offering which complements its existing products in the Oil  Gas industry. The purchase price, net of $12 million of acquired cash, consisted of $92 million paid at closing, $1 million paid in 2017, and $8 million paid in 2018. In addition, there is contingent consideration with a fair value of $38 million as of the acquisition date which is comprised of two components: 1) our expected use of a charitable contribution carry forward for U.S. tax purposes acquired from Kemper which has an estimated maximum payment of $20 million and 2) a specified industry performance index price target during the period from January 1, 2017 to December 31, 2021 which is capped at $20 million per year. As of December 31, 2018, $10 million was paid related to the use of the charitable contribution carry forward for U.S. tax purposes with an additional $10 million paid in January of 2019. No amounts were paid through 2018 for the contingent consideration related to the specified industry performance index price target, which continues to be remeasured each reporting period at its estimated fair value with any adjustment included in Other operating (income) expenses in Statement 1. The transaction was financed with available cash. Tangible assets as of the acquisition date were $147 million , recorded at their fair values, and included cash of $12 million , receivables of $7 million , short term investments of $3 million , net deferred tax assets of $21 million , inventories of $63 million , and property, plant and equipment of $41 million . Finite-lived intangible assets acquired of $8 million included customer relationships, developed technology and trade names. The finite lived intangible assets are being amortized on a straight-line basis over an amortization period of 10 years . Liabilities assumed as of the acquisition date were $6 million , which represented their fair values. Goodwill of $1 million , non-deductible for income tax purposes, represented the excess of the consideration transferred over the net assets recognized and represented the estimated future economic benefits arising from other assets acquired that could not be individually identified and separately recognized. The results of the acquired business for the period from the acquisition date are included in the accompanying consolidated financial statements and reported in the Energy  Transportation segment in Note 23. Assuming this transaction had been made at the beginning of any period presented, the consolidated pro forma results would not be materially different from reported results. 25. Restructuring costs  Our accounting for employee separations is dependent upon how the particular program is designed. For voluntary programs, eligible separation costs are recognized at the time of employee acceptance unless the acceptance requires explicit approval by the company. For involuntary programs, eligible costs are recognized when management has approved the program, the affected employees have been properly notified and the costs are estimable. Restructuring costs for 2018, 2017 and 2016 were as follows: ##TABLE_START        (Millions of dollars)    Employee separations 1  $  $  $ Contract terminations 1    Long-lived asset impairments 1    Defined benefit plan curtailments and termination benefits 2  (8 )   Other 3    Total restructuring costs  $  $ 1,256  $ 1,019        1 Recognized in Other operating (income) expenses.       2 Recognized in Other income (expense). 3 Represents costs related to our restructuring programs, primarily for accelerated depreciation, project management costs, equipment relocation and inventory write-downs, and also LIFO inventory decrement benefits from inventory liquidations at closed facilities, all of which are primarily included in Cost of goods sold.        ##TABLE_ENDThe restructuring costs in 2018 were primarily related to ongoing facility closures across the company. In 2017, about half of the restructuring costs were related to the closure of the facility in Gosselies, Belgium, within Construction Industries, and the remainder was related to other restructuring actions across the company. The restructuring costs in 2016 were primarily related to actions in Resource Industries in response to continued weakness in the mining industry. In addition, costs in 2016 resulted from our decision to discontinue production of on-highway vocational trucks within Energy  Transportation and other restructuring actions across the company. Restructuring costs are a reconciling item between Segment profit and Consolidated profit before taxes. See Note 23 for more information. The following table summarizes the 2017 and 2018 employee separation activity: ##TABLE_START (Millions of dollars)  Liability balance at December 31, 2016 $ Increase in liability (separation charges) Reduction in liability (payments) (423 ) Liability balance at December 31, 2017 $ Increase in liability (separation charges) Reduction in liability (payments) (276 ) Liability balance at December 31, 2018 $   ##TABLE_END Most of the remaining liability balance as of December 31, 2018 is expected to be paid in 2019. In March 2017, Caterpillar informed Belgian authorities of the decision to proceed to a collective dismissal, which led to the closure of the Gosselies site, impacting about 2,000 employees. Production of Caterpillar products at the Gosselies site ended during the second quarter of 2017. The other operations and functions at the Gosselies site were phased out by the end of the second quarter of 2018. The program concluded in 2018, and we incurred a total of $647 million of restructuring costs (primarily in 2017) under the program. Those costs were primarily related to employee separation costs, long-lived asset impairments, and other costs which were partially offset by a LIFO inventory decrement benefit. Restructuring costs for the year ended December 31, 2016 were $1,019 million . Throughout 2016, we initiated the following restructuring plans: ##TABLE_START  In February 2016, we made the decision to discontinue production of on-highway vocational trucks. Based on the business climate in the truck industry and a thorough evaluation of the business, the company decided it would withdraw from this market. We recognized $104 million of restructuring costs, primarily related to long-lived asset impairments and sales discounts. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  In the second half of 2016, we took additional restructuring actions in Resource Industries, including ending the production of track drills; pursuing strategic alternatives related to room and pillar products; consolidation of two product development divisions; and additional actions in response to ongoing weakness in the mining industry. For the year ended December 31, 2016, we incurred $369 million of restructuring costs for these plans primarily related to long-lived asset impairments, employee separation costs and inventory write-downs. ##TABLE_END In September 2015, we announced a large scale restructuring plan (the Plan) including a voluntary retirement enhancement program for qualifying U.S. employees, several voluntary separation programs outside of the U.S., additional involuntary programs throughout the company and manufacturing facility consolidations and closures that occurred through 2018. The largest action among those included in the Plan was related to our European manufacturing footprint which led to the Gosselies, Belgium, facility, closure as discussed above. We incurred $121 million , $817 million and $281 million of restructuring costs associated with these actions in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Total restructuring costs incurred since inception of the Plan were $1,788 million . The remaining costs of approximately $50 million related to the Plan are expected to be recognized in 2019. 26.
