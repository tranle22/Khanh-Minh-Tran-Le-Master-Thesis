BUSINESS ##TABLE_END Overview We are a leading provider of enterprise cloud computing applications. We provide a comprehensive customer and collaboration relationship management, or CRM, service to businesses of all sizes and industries worldwide and we provide a technology platform for customers and developers to build and run business applications. We were incorporated in Delaware in February 1999, and founded on the simple concept of delivering enterprise business applications via the Internet or cloud. Cloud computing refers to the use of Internet-based computing, storage and connectivity technology for a variety of different services. We introduced our first service in February 2000. Since then, we have augmented our CRM service with new editions and enhanced features. We have also introduced other enterprise cloud computing applications on our Force.com platform to customers and developers so they can build complementary applications to extend beyond CRM. Additionally, we have introduced our AppExchange directory of enterprise cloud computing applications that are integrated with our CRM service and in most cases have been developed on our platform by third parties. Our principal executive offices are located in San Francisco, California and our principal website address is www.salesforce.com . Our office address is The Landmark @ One Market, Suite 300, San Francisco, California 94105. We designed and developed our offering to be an easy-to-use and intuitive solution that can be deployed rapidly, customized easily and integrated with other software applications. We deliver our service through any of the market-leading Web browsers. Customers who use our CRM services and platform are able to avoid much of the expense and complexity of traditional enterprise software development and implementations. As a result, our customers incur less risk and lower upfront costs and benefit from increased productivity.  We market our service to businesses on a subscription basis, primarily through our direct sales efforts and indirectly through partners. Through our Force.com platform and developer tools and our AppExchange, we also encourage third parties to develop additional functionality and applications that run on our platform, but which are sold separately from, or in conjunction with, our CRM service. Cloud Computing Cloud computing fundamentally changes the way enterprise business software applications are developed and deployed. Application developers no longer need to create and manage their own infrastructure of servers, storage, network devices, operating system software and development tools in order to create a business application. Instead, the entire infrastructure is managed by third parties who specialize in infrastructure management, and developers simply use an Internet browser to access the development environment. Application users can gain access to a variety of business applications via an Internet browser or mobile device, and are able to take advantage of a robust, secure, scalable and highly available application at a relatively low cost, without the cost and complexity of managing the application. Our vision of enterprise cloud computing is based on a multi-tenancy technology architecture and a subscription service business model. With multi-tenancy, multiple customers share application, platform and infrastructure services provided by the vendor. Subscriptions allow customers to pay a set amount over a contract period versus the relatively high upfront costs associated with traditional software. Cloud Applications (formerly referred to as Software-as-a-Service or SaaS) Cloud applications enable businesses to subscribe to a wide variety of application services that are developed specifically for, and delivered over, the Internet on an as-needed basis with little or no implementation services required and without the need to install and manage third-party software in-house. Historically, only large businesses could afford to make investments in enterprise resource planning and CRM applications to gain an enterprise-wide view of business information and automate and improve basic processes. However, cloud applications are available to businesses of all sizes and across all industries. Multi-tenant architecture enables cloud vendors like us to leverage a common infrastructure and software code base across all of our customers who benefit from access to the most current release of the application, automated upgrades, more rapid innovation and the economies of a shared infrastructure. We believe the shift to cloud applications provides significant benefits even beyond those associated with multi-tenant infrastructure. Businesses are able to realize many of the benefits offered by traditional enterprise software vendors, such as a comprehensive set of features and functionality and the ability to customize and integrate with other applications, while at the same time reducing the risks and lowering the total costs associated with owning enterprise software. As a result, we believe the continued emergence of cloud applications is bringing about a fundamental transformation in the enterprise software industry as businesses are offered the choice of replacing their purchased software with subscriptions to a wide range of application services. Cloud Platforms (formerly referred to as Platform-as-a-Service or PaaS) We believe that cloud applications and their related success in the market are the most widely understood segment of enterprise cloud computing. However, enterprise cloud computing also includes building cloud applications on an application development platform. This market is called the cloud platform market. Application developers use cloud platform technology to build both custom applications for individual businesses or vertical industries, and horizontal applications to address standard business processes that can be sold to a broad range of potential customers. Application developers include corporate information technology  (IT) departments that typically develop applications for a companys internal use and independent software vendors (ISVs) that develop applications to sell to customers. Traditionally, these developers have needed to purchase, install, test and maintain complex software and hardware infrastructure to develop and deliver their applications. This requirement resulted in more time and resources being spent maintaining infrastructure and less time and resources being available to actually develop applications, with a resulting reduction in innovation and productivity levels. Cloud platforms enable corporate IT developers and ISVs to leverage the benefits of a multi-tenant platform for developing new applications. Cloud platforms allow developers to build applications with a browser and an Internet connection, just as cloud applications allow users to use applications through a browser. In addition, developers typically pay no upfront costs when building cloud applications, with costs only to be incurred at the point of application deployment. Our Solution Our CRM applications help companies better record, track, manage, analyze and share information regarding sales, customer service and support, and marketing operations. Our Force.com cloud computing platform, which was introduced in 2007, allows customers and partners to more extensively customize and integrate our applications or build entirely new cloud applications beyond CRM without having to invest in new software, hardware and related infrastructure. These newly developed applications, which are hosted and run on our infrastructure, can then be used for internal operations or sold to third parties. We also offer the AppExchange, an online directory for cloud applications, where customers can browse, test-drive and deploy applications from salesforce.com and our partners. Since we introduced the AppExchange directory in 2006, more than 800 applications developed mostly by our partners have been posted to the directory. Substantially all of our subscription and support revenue comes from subscriptions to our core CRM application services, all of which include the customization benefits of the Force.com platform. In order for customers to install and run custom applications, whether built by themselves or by our partners, they must be a subscriber to our service. By subscribing to our service, our customers do not have to make large and potentially risky upfront investments in software, hardware, implementation services and IT staff as they would with traditional software solutions. We believe that our service enables businesses to rapidly achieve the benefits of higher productivity, and lower their total cost of ownership for their business application. Key advantages of our solution include: ##TABLE_START    Secure, scalable and reliable delivery platform. The delivery platform for our service has been designed to provide our customers with high levels of performance, reliability, and security. We have built, and continue to invest in, a comprehensive security infrastructure, including firewalls, intrusion detection systems, and encryption for transmissions over the Internet, which we monitor and test on a regular basis. In addition, all of our customers data is replicated in near real-time to help protect the data and ensure service continuity in the event of a major disaster. We built and maintain a multi-tenant application architecture that has been designed to enable our service to scale securely, reliably, and cost-effectively. Our multi-tenant application architecture maintains the integrity and separation of customer data while still permitting all customers to use the same application functionality simultaneously. Our architecture also enables customers to segment access privileges across their user base. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    Rapid deployment. Our service can be deployed rapidly since our customers do not have to spend time procuring, installing or maintaining the servers, storage, networking equipment, security products, or other infrastructure hardware and software necessary to ensure a scalable and reliable service. We also offer consulting, training services, and online resources to assist customers in rapidly deploying and optimizing their use of our service. ##TABLE_END  ##TABLE_START    Ea se of integration. Our platform is designed to enable IT professionals to integrate our service with existing applications quickly and seamlessly. Our Force.com platform provides a set of application programming interfaces, or APIs, that enable customers and independent developers to both integrate our service with existing third-party, custom, and legacy applications and write their own application services that integrate with our service. For example, many of our customers use the Force.com API to move customer-related data from custom-developed and legacy applications into our service on a periodic basis to provide greater visibility into their activities. Other customers and partners have, for example, developed their own talent management solutions and procurement solutions on the Force.com platform. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    Rapid development of applications using the Force.com platform . Our customers and third party developers can develop applications rapidly because of the ease of use and the benefits of a multi-tenant platform. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    Lower total cost of ownership. We enable customers to achieve significant upfront savings relative to the traditional enterprise software model. Customers benefit from the predictability of their future costs since they pay for the service on a per subscriber basis for the term of the subscription contract. All upgrades are included in our service, so customers are not burdened or disrupted by the periodic need to perform system upgrades. Because we implement all upgrades on our servers, new features and functionality automatically become part of our service on the release date and therefore benefit all of our customers immediately. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    Increasing innovation. By providing infrastructure and development environments on demand, we provide developers the opportunity to create new and innovative applications without having to invest in hardware and distribution. A developer with an idea for a new application can log onto our platform, develop, host and support their system on Force.com and make the application accessible for a fee to our customers. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    High levels of user adoption. We have designed our service to be intuitive and easy to use. Since our service contains many tools and features recognizable to users of popular websites such as those of Amazon, eBay, and Google, it has a more familiar user interface than typical enterprise CRM applications. As a result, our users do not require substantial training on how to use and benefit from our service. We conduct extensive surveys of our users to gauge their experiences with our service so that we may determine potential areas of improvement. In addition, because of the nature of our service, we receive constant, automated feedback as to which features customers use or dont use, allowing us to improve our service based on this information. ##TABLE_END Our Strategy Our objective is to be the leading provider of CRM application services. We also want to be the leading cloud computing platform on which our customers and partners build applications. Key elements of our strategy include: ##TABLE_START    Strengthening our existing CRM applications and extending into new functional areas within CRM. We designed our service to easily accommodate new features and functions. We intend to continue to add CRM features and functionality to our core service that we will make available to customers at no additional charge. We offer advanced editions for an additional subscription fee to customers that require enhanced CRM capabilities. We have a growing portfolio of applications that serve different customer segments and markets. We also regularly evaluate and execute acquisition or investment opportunities in complementary businesses, joint ventures, services and technologies in an effort to strengthen and extend our service CRM offerings. We expect to continue to make such investments and acquisitions in the future. ##TABLE_END  ##TABLE_START    Pursuing new customers and new territories aggressively. We believe that our cloud application and platform offerings provide significant value for businesses of any size. As a result, we will continue to aggressively target businesses of all sizes, primarily through our direct sales force. We have steadily increased and plan to continue to increase the number of direct sales professionals we employ, and we intend to develop additional distribution channels for our service. We have created several editions of our service to address the distinct requirements of businesses of different sizes. We also believe that there is a substantial market opportunity for our service outside of North America. We plan to continue to aggressively market to customers outside of North America by recruiting local sales and support professionals and by building partnerships that help us add customers in these regions. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    Deepening relationships with our existing customer base. We believe there is significant opportunity to leverage our relationships with existing customers. As the customer realizes the benefits of our service, we aim to either upgrade our customers to higher premium priced editions or sell more subscriptions by targeting additional functional areas and business units within the customer organization and ultimately pursuing enterprise-wide deployments. We aim to have our customers renew their subscriptions at the end of their contractual terms and run customer success and other programs in an effort to secure renewals of existing customers. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    Continuing to lead the industry transformation to cloud computing . We believe that the market transformation to cloud applications and platforms is a growing trend in the information technology industry. We enable customers of all sizes to benefit from the capabilities of enterprise software applications. We believe we have established a leadership position in this new enterprise cloud computing industry both as a successful vendor of CRM application services and also as an enabler for third parties to create their own cloud applications through our platform. We seek to extend our leadership position in this industry by continuing to innovate and bringing new application and platform services and value-added technologies to market, as well as by providing the tools needed by third parties to develop their own cloud applications on our platform. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    Encouraging the development of third-party applications on our Force.com cloud computing platform . Our Force.com cloud computing platform enables existing customers, ISVs and third-party developers to develop and deliver cloud applications they have built in our multi-tenant environment. It is a platform on which applications can be created, tested, published, and run. In addition, these applications can be listed on the AppExchange, our online marketplace of cloud applications, or sold by ISVs. We believe the ecosystem of cloud developers and ISVs will address the business requirements of both current and potential customers. ##TABLE_END The Salesforce CRM Service Our comprehensive array of services enable customers and subscribers to systematically record, store, analyze, share, and act upon business data and to help businesses manage customer accounts, track sales leads, evaluate marketing campaigns, and provide post-sales service. We also enable companies to generate reports and summaries of this data and share them with authorized individuals across functional areas. Most of the features of our service can be accessed through a variety of devices, including laptop computers and mobile devices. Additionally, our service is highly configurable in a short amount of time, enabling our customers to tailor its appearance, policy settings, language, workflow, reports, and other characteristics without the use of significant IT resources or consultants. During fiscal 2010, our services were marketed under the two brands, the Sales Cloud and the Service Cloud: ##TABLE_START    Sales Cloud . The sales force automation features of our application services are marketed under our Sales Cloud brand. Through the Sales Cloud, users are able to be more productive through the automation of manual and repetitive tasks and access to better and more organized data about their current customers and prospects. Our customers are also able establish a system and process for recording, tracking, and sharing information about sales opportunities, sales leads, sales forecasts, the ##TABLE_END  ##TABLE_START  sales process, and closed business, as well as managing sales territories. Our customers are also better able to manage unstructured information such as sales collateral, presentations, price lists, and video assets. In addition, the Sales Cloud encompasses partner relationship management functionality (including channel management and partner portals) and marketing automation (including campaigns, ROI tracking, and Google AdWords integration). ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    Service Cloud. Our customer service and support automation features are marketed under our Service Cloud brand. Through the Service Cloud, companies are able to maintain better relationships with their existing customers and more efficiently address a variety of service and support needs, such as advice about products and services, requests for repairs, complaints about faulty goods, and the need for additional goods and services. Using the Service Cloud, customers can leverage our complete cloud-computing platform to deliver a comprehensive solution for their customer service interactions across every service channel: call centers with phone, email, and chat; Web portals for self-service and customer collaboration; and community interactions within social networks. ##TABLE_END As of January 31, 2010, we offered five principal editions of our service for a fee: Contact Manager Edition, Group Edition, Professional Edition, Enterprise Edition, and Unlimited Edition. We derived over 90 percent of our revenues from subscriptions to, and support for, our service in fiscal 2010. ##TABLE_START    Contact Manager Edition. Contact Manager Edition, which is limited to five subscribers, is targeted primarily at individuals and small businesses that seek basic contact and customer management. Users can track customer contacts and manage tasks and activities. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    Group Edition. Group Edition, which is also limited to five subscribers, is targeted primarily at small businesses and workgroups that seek a basic sales force automation solution. Users can share important customer data and manage their customer relationsfrom the start of the sales cycle to closing the deal to providing basic customer service. In addition to everything available in Contact Manager Edition, Group Edition offers access to opportunities, accounts, contacts, tasks and basic reports. Using the Force.com platform, customers can further extend and customize Group Edition by adding additional custom tabs and/or a custom application. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    Professional Edition. Professional Edition is targeted primarily at medium-sized and large businesses that need a robust and complete CRM solution but do not need some of the more advanced administrative features and integration capabilities. Professional Edition offers companies a comprehensive CRM suite that business users can use to manage every aspect of the customer lifecycle. In addition to everything available in Group Edition, it provides users more advanced CRM functionality such as: forecasts, lead management, contract management, solutions, and online case capture. Professional Edition also comes with standard, easy-to-use customization, security and sharing, integration, and administration tools to facilitate any small to mid-sized deployment. Using the Force.com platform, Professional Edition customers have more flexibility than Group Edition customers to further extend and customize their service by adding more custom applications, custom tabs, and/or custom objects. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    Enterprise Edition. Enterprise Edition is designed to meet the complex business needs of large organizations with many divisions or departments. In addition to all of the functionality available in Professional Edition, Enterprise Edition offers customers: ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    advanced CRM functionality, such as territory management that uses a rule-based territory assignment engine to categorize accounts and users into territories, products, and schedules that track revenue and quantity by opportunities; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    multi-divisional sharing and permissions such as profile-based departmental security and sharing; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    workflow and business process control such as workflow automation tasks; and ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    enterprise customization and integration tools that can support large-scale deployments, such as APIs for back-office integration that enable companies to readily integrate Salesforce CRM with ##TABLE_END  ##TABLE_START  ERP applications and other data sources. Customers also have greater flexibility and control to fully extend and customize our service by adding more custom applications, custom tabs, and/or custom objects. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    Unlimited Edition. Unlimited Edition is our most fully featured edition, with exclusive features available only in Unlimited Edition and bundled add-on features included at a significant cost saving over the total price of the individual features. In addition to all of the functionality available in Enterprise Edition, Unlimited Edition includes unlimited installations from the AppExchange, increased customization and extension possibilities that customers can implement on their own, including Force.com sandbox (described below), mobile accessibility, Premier Support with Administration, and additional storage. ##TABLE_END Each of the editions described above entitles customers to our standard customer support services. For advanced customers with more complex business needs, we provide additional levels of fee-based customer support. In addition to the five paying editions, we continue to innovate and develop additional products and services as optional add-on subscriptions to better meet different customers needs. Examples include: ##TABLE_START    Offline and mobile accessibility allows customers to view and modify their CRM data, such as accounts, contacts, opportunities, tasks, and events, while in the field. Offline and mobile accessibility is included in all Enterprise and Unlimited Edition service subscriptions. Customers of Professional Edition can choose to subscribe to either or both as an add-on service. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    Force.coms sandbox enables customers to test new customizations or features before deploying them. Customers can use sandbox to install, modify, and test applications downloaded from the AppExchange or to create a development environment for building and testing integrations and internally built applications. Additionally, customers may use sandbox as an exact replica of their production Salesforce CRM systems for employee-training purposes. Customers of Professional Edition and Enterprise Edition can choose to subscribe to sandbox as an add-on service. ##TABLE_END Force.com Platform The Force.com cloud computing platform, which is marketed under our Custom Cloud brand, enhances the attractiveness of our service, particularly to enterprise customers. The Force.com platform provides a feature set and technology environment for building business applications, including data models and objects to manage data, a workflow engine for managing collaboration of data between users, a user interface model to handle forms and other interactions, and a Web services API for programmatic access and integration. The Force.com platform provides the tools and infrastructure required to: ##TABLE_START    deploy our application service for CRM; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    customize and integrate existing enterprise software applications; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    create and deploy new business applications that are pre-integrated with our service and leverage the same user interface or customize the user interface specific to customer requirements; and ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    sample and deploy applications built by third parties from the AppExchange. ##TABLE_END The AppExchange We offer the AppExchange, an online directory that provides customers a way to browse, test-drive, share, and install applications developed on our Force.com platform. Partners and developers can offer their applications on the AppExchange directory. This directory gives our users a way to find and install applications to expand their use of the Force.com platform to areas that are complementary to or extend beyond CRM.  When installing an enterprise cloud computing application built by a third-party partner or developer, customers authorize the third-party provider access to their data. Because they are built, managed and provisioned by third parties, we do not warrant the functionality, security and integrity of the data transmission or processing. Professional Services We offer consulting and implementation services and training that complement our enterprise cloud computing CRM application service. Consulting and Implementation Services We offer consulting and implementation services to our customers to facilitate the adoption of our enterprise cloud computing CRM application and platform services. Consulting services consist of services such as business process mapping, project management services and guidance on best practices in using our service. Implementation services include systems integration, technical architecture and development, configuration and data conversion as well as developing and delivering customized education programs for our customers. Most of our consulting and implementation engagements are billed on a time and materials basis. As the reach of our enterprise cloud computing application services grows, partners and other third party consulting and professional service providers will likely play a more integral part in also providing these consulting and implementation services to our customers. Training  Certification We offer a number of traditional classroom and online educational classes that address topics such as implementing, using, administering and developing on our service. We also offer classes for our partners who implement our service on behalf of our customers. We bill the traditional classroom and some of the online educational classes on a per person, per class basis. There is a selection of online educational classes available at no charge to customers who subscribe to our service. In order to expand our reach to the growing customer base, we have also established an Authorized Training Center program that allows authorized third party training partners to deliver training curricula. Additionally, as the population of administrators, developers, consultants and partners grows, we established a training and examination program for Salesforce certification in specific areas of expertise. Technology, Development and Operations Technology and Development We do not provide software that must be written to different hardware, operating system and database platforms, or that depends upon a customers unique systems environment. Rather, we have optimized our service to run on a specific database and operating system using the tools and platforms best suited to serve our customers. Performance, functional depth and the usability of our service drive our technology decisions and product direction. We built our service as a highly scalable, multi-tenant application written in Java and Oracle PL/SQL. We use commercially available hardware and a combination of proprietary and commercially available software, including database software from Oracle Corporation, to provide our service. The application server is custom- built and runs on a lightweight Java Servlet and Java Server Pages engine. We have custom-built core services such as database connection pooling and user session management tuned to our specific architecture and environment, allowing us to continue to scale our service. We have combined a stateless environment, in which a user is not bound to a single server but can be routed in the most optimal way to any number of servers, with an advanced data caching layer. Our customers can access the service through any Web browser.  Our service treats all customers as logically separate tenants in central applications and databases. As a result, we are able to spread the cost of delivering our service across our user base. In addition, because we do not have to manage thousands of distinct applications with their own business logic and database schemas, we believe that we can scale our business faster than traditional software vendors. Moreover, we can focus our resources on building new functionality to deliver to our customer base as a whole rather than on maintaining an infrastructure to support each of their distinct applications. Our research and development efforts are focused on improving and enhancing the features, functionality and security of our existing service offerings as well as developing new proprietary services such as Force.com. In addition, from time to time we supplement our internal research and development activities with outside development resources and acquired technology. Because of our common, multi-tenant application architecture, we are able to provide all of our customers with a service based on a single version of our application. We are able to upgrade all of our customers at the same time with each release. As a result, we do not have to maintain multiple versions of our application. Operations We currently serve our customers from third-party data center hosting facilities located on the west and east coasts of the United States. Additionally, we recently started serving customers from a new data center hosting facility in Singapore. All of our hosting facilities are currently leased from Equinix, Inc., except for features added through acquisition which are temporarily served through alternate facilities. The Equinix facilities are built to the same critical systems building codes as hospitals and other vital infrastructure. The facilities are secured by around-the-clock guards, biometric access screening and escort-controlled access, and are supported by on-site backup generators in the event of a power failure. As part of our current disaster recovery arrangements, all of our customers data is currently replicated in near real-time. This strategy is designed to both protect our customers data and ensure service continuity in the event of a major disaster. Even with the disaster recovery arrangements, our service could be interrupted. Our agreement with Equinix provides for Equinix to supply space in its secure facilities as well as power. Bandwidth to the Internet is provided by multiple independent companies. We continuously monitor the performance of our service. The monitoring features we have built or licensed include centralized performance consoles, automated load distribution tools and various self-diagnostic tools and programs. In addition we have a data center in San Francisco, which is primarily for internal information technology, development and quality assurance infrastructure. Customers Our revenues are divided among small businesses (companies with fewer than 200 employees), medium-size businesses (200 or more employees and up to $1 billion in annual revenues), and large businesses (over $1 billion in annual revenues). The number of paying subscriptions at each of our customers ranges from one to tens of thousands. None of our customers accounted for more than 5 percent of our revenues in fiscal 2010, 2009, or 2008. Sources of Revenue We generally recognize revenue ratably over the contract terms beginning on the commencement date of each contract. Amounts that have been invoiced are recorded in accounts receivable and in deferred revenue or revenue, depending on whether the revenue recognition criteria have been met. The deferred revenue balance on our Consolidated Balance Sheet does not represent the total contract value of an annual or multi-year, non-cancelable subscription agreements. Unbilled deferred revenue was over $1.0 billion as of January 31, 2010  and over $700.0 million as of January 31, 2009. Unbilled deferred revenue represents future billings under our non-cancelable subscription agreements that have not been invoiced and, accordingly, are not recorded in deferred revenue. We expect that the amount of unbilled deferred revenue may change from year-to-year for several reasons, including the specific timing and duration of large customer subscription agreements, varying billing cycles of non-cancelable subscription agreements, the specific timing of customer renewals, foreign currency fluctuations, the timing of when unbilled deferred revenue is to be recognized as revenue, and changes in customer financial circumstances. For multi-year subscription agreements billed annually, the associated unbilled deferred revenue is typically high at the beginning of the contract period, zero just prior to renewal, and increases if the agreement is renewed. Low unbilled deferred revenue attributable to a particular subscription agreement is often associated with an impending renewal and may not be an indicator of the likelihood of renewal or future revenue from such customer. Accordingly, we expect that the amount of aggregate unbilled deferred revenue will change from year-to-year depending in part upon the number and dollar amount of subscription agreements at particular stages in their renewal cycle. Such fluctuations are not a reliable indicator of future revenues. Sales, Marketing and Customer Support We organize our sales and marketing programs by geographic regions, including North America, Europe, Japan, and the Asia Pacific region other than Japan. Direct Sales We sell subscriptions to our service primarily through our direct sales force comprised of inside sales, which consists of personnel that sell to customers primarily by phone, and field sales personnel, that are primarily based in geographic territories comprising customers and prospects. Both our inside sales and field sales personnel are supported by telesales representatives who are primarily responsible for generating qualifying leads. Our small business, general business and enterprise account executives and account managers focus their efforts on small, medium-size and large enterprises, respectively. Referral and Indirect Sales We have a network of partners who refer customer prospects to us and assist us in selling to these prospects. The network includes consulting firms, other technology vendors, systems integrators and partners in markets where we do not have a large direct sales presence. In return, we typically pay these partners a fee based on the first-year subscription revenue generated by the customers they refer. We expense these fees at the time the customer signs the subscription service contract. We also continue to develop distribution channels for our subscription service. Marketing Our marketing strategy is to continually elevate our brand and generate significant demand for our offerings. We use a variety of marketing programs to target our prospective and current customers, partners, and developers. Our primary marketing activities include: ##TABLE_START    press and industry analyst relations to garner third-party validation and generate positive coverage for our company and product strategy; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    user conferences and launch events, as well as participation in trade shows and industry events, to create customer awareness and prospect enthusiasm; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    search engine marketing and online and print advertising to drive traffic to our Web properties; ##TABLE_END  ##TABLE_START    Web site development to engage and educate prospects and generate interest through product information and demonstrations, free trials, case studies, white papers, and marketing collateral; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    email, direct mail, and phone campaigns to capture leads that can be funneled into our sales organization; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    use of customer testimonials; and ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    sales tools and field marketing events to enable our sales organization to more effectively convert pipeline into completed transactions. ##TABLE_END Customer Service and Support Our global customer support group responds to both business and technical inquires from our customers relating to how to use our products and is available to customers by the web, telephone and email. Basic customer support during business hours is available at no charge to customers who purchase any of our paying editions. Premier customer support includes extended availability and additional services, such as an assigned support representative and/or administrator. Premier customer support is available for a separate fee, or is included in our Unlimited Edition. Additional support services include developer support and partner support. International Sales We generate approximately 30 percent of our total revenues from customers in Europe and Asia Pacific, including Japan. We expect international markets to provide increased opportunities for our applications and services in the future. Our current international efforts are focused on strengthening our direct sales and marketing presence outside of North America, and generating more revenues from these regions. Seasonality Our fourth quarter has historically been our strongest quarter for new business. For a more detailed discussion, see the Seasonal Nature of Deferred Revenue and Accounts Receivable discussion in Managements Discussion and Analysis. Competition The market for enterprise CRM business applications and development platforms is highly competitive, rapidly evolving and fragmented, and subject to changing technology, shifting customer needs and frequent introductions of new products and services. Many prospective customers have invested substantial personnel and financial resources to implement and integrate traditional enterprise software into their businesses, and therefore may be reluctant or unwilling to migrate to an enterprise cloud computing application service. Additionally, third party developers may be reluctant to build application services on our platform since they have invested significantly in other competing technology products. We compete primarily with vendors of packaged CRM software, whose software is installed by the customer directly, and companies offering on-demand CRM applications. We also compete with internally developed applications and face, or expect to face, competition from enterprise software vendors and online service providers who may develop toolsets and products that allow customers to build new applications that run on the customers current infrastructure or as hosted services. Our current principal competitors include: ##TABLE_START    enterprise software application vendors including Microsoft Corporation, Oracle Corporation, and SAP AG; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    on-demand CRM application service providers such as Microsoft Corporation, NetSuite, Inc., Oracle Corporation, RightNow Technologies, Inc. and SAP AG.; ##TABLE_END  ##TABLE_START    enterprise application service providers including IBM Corporation and Oracle Corporation; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    traditional platform development environment companies, including established vendors, such as IBM Corporation, Microsoft Corporation, and Oracle Corporation; and ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    cloud computing development platform companies, including some with whom we are partners, others such as Microsoft Corporation, which has initiated plans to enter this market, and a variety of smaller start up companies that have invested in cloud computing technology. ##TABLE_END We believe that as enterprise software application and platform vendors shift more of their focus to cloud computing, they will be a greater competitive threat. We believe the principal competitive factors in our market include the following: ##TABLE_START    proven track record of customer success; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    speed and ease of implementation; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    product functionality; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    financial stability and viability of the vendor; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    product adoption; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    ease of use and rates of user adoption; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    low total cost of ownership and demonstrable cost-effective benefits for customers; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    performance, security, scalability, flexibility and reliability of the service; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    ease of integration with existing applications; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    quality of customer support; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    availability and quality of implementation, consulting and training services; and ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    vendor reputation and brand awareness. ##TABLE_END Intellectual Property We rely on a combination of trademark, copyright, trade secret and patent laws in the United States and other jurisdictions as well as confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions to protect our proprietary technology and our brand. We also enter into confidentiality and proprietary rights agreements with our employees, consultants and other third parties and control access to software, documentation and other proprietary information. As of January 31, 2010, we have several issued U.S. patents and many pending U.S. and international patent applications. We have received in the past, and may receive in the future, communications from third parties claiming that we have infringed the intellectual property rights of others. The cost to defend or settle these claims could be material to the net income or cash flows or both of a particular quarter. Our technologies may not be able to withstand any third-party claims against their use. The outcome of any litigation is inherently uncertain. Any intellectual property claims, with or without merit, could be time-consuming and expensive to resolve, could divert management attention from executing our business plan and could require us to change our technology, change our business practices and/or pay monetary damages or enter into short- or long-term royalty or licensing agreements which may not be available in the future at the same terms or at all. In addition, many of our subscription agreements require us to indemnify our customers for third-party intellectual property infringement claims, which would increase the cost to us of an adverse ruling on such a claim. Any adverse determination related to intellectual property claims or litigation could prevent us from offering our service to others, or could otherwise adversely affect our operating results or cash flows or both in a particular quarter.  Employees As of January 31, 2010, we had 3,969 employees. None of our employees is represented by a labor union.

RISK FACTORS ##TABLE_END The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones facing us. Other events that we do not currently anticipate or that we currently deem immaterial also may affect our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. Risks Related to Our Business and Industry Defects or disruptions in our service could diminish demand for our service and subject us to substantial liability. Because our service is complex and we have incorporated a variety of new computer hardware and software, both developed in-house and acquired from third party vendors, our service may have errors or defects that users identify after they begin using it that could result in unanticipated downtime for our subscribers and harm our reputation and our business. Internet-based services frequently contain undetected errors when first introduced or when new versions or enhancements are released. We have from time to time found defects in our service and new errors in our existing service may be detected in the future. In addition, our customers may use our service in unanticipated ways that may cause a disruption in service for other customers attempting to access their data. Since our customers use our service for important aspects of their business, any errors, defects, disruptions in service or other performance problems with our service could hurt our reputation and may damage our customers businesses. If that occurs, customers could elect not to renew, or delay or withhold payment to us, we could lose future sales or customers may make warranty or other claims against us, which could result in an increase in our provision for doubtful accounts, an increase in collection cycles for accounts receivable or the expense and risk of litigation. Interruptions or delays in service from our third-party data center hosting facilities could impair the delivery of our service and harm our business. We currently serve our customers from third-party data center hosting facilities located on the west and east coasts of the United States. Additionally, we recently started serving customers from a new data center hosting facility in Singapore. Any damage to, or failure of, our systems generally could result in interruptions in our service. As we continue to add data centers and add capacity in our existing data centers, we may move or transfer our data and our customers data. Despite precautions taken during this process, any unsuccessful data transfers may impair the delivery of our service. Further, any damage to, or failure of, our systems generally could result in interruptions in our service. Interruptions in our service may reduce our revenue, cause us to issue credits or pay penalties, cause customers to terminate their subscriptions and adversely affect our renewal rates and our ability to attract new customers. Our business will also be harmed if our customers and potential customers believe our service is unreliable. As part of our current disaster recovery arrangements, our production environment and all of our customers data is currently replicated in near real-time in a facility located on the east coast. Features added through  acquisition are temporarily served through alternate facilities. We do not control the operation of any of these facilities, and they are vulnerable to damage or interruption from earthquakes, floods, fires, power loss, telecommunications failures and similar events. They may also be subject to break-ins, sabotage, intentional acts of vandalism and similar misconduct. Despite precautions taken at these facilities, the occurrence of a natural disaster or an act of terrorism, a decision to close the facilities without adequate notice or other unanticipated problems at these facilities could result in lengthy interruptions in our service. Even with the disaster recovery arrangements, our service could be interrupted. If our security measures are breached and unauthorized access is obtained to a customers data or our data, our service may be perceived as not being secure, customers may curtail or stop using our service and we may incur significant legal and financial exposure and liabilities. Our service involves the storage and transmission of customers proprietary information, and security breaches could expose us to a risk of loss of this information, litigation and possible liability. These security measures may be breached as a result of third-party action, employee error, malfeasance or otherwise, during transfer of data to additional data centers or at any time, and result in someone obtaining unauthorized access to our data or our customers data. Additionally, third parties may attempt to fraudulently induce employees or customers into disclosing sensitive information such as user names, passwords or other information in order to gain access to our data or our customers data. Because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access, or to sabotage systems, change frequently and generally are not recognized until launched against a target, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures. In addition, our customers may authorize third party technology providers, whose applications are available through our AppExchange directory, to access their customer data. Because we do not control the transmissions between our customers and third-party AppExchange technology providers, or the processing of such data by third-party AppExchange technology providers, we cannot ensure the complete integrity or security of such transmissions or processing. Any security breach could result in a loss of confidence in the security of our service, damage our reputation, lead to legal liability and negatively impact our future sales. Weakened global economic conditions may adversely affect our industry, business and results of operations. Our overall performance depends in part on worldwide economic conditions. The United States and other key international economies have been impacted by falling demand for a variety of goods and services, restricted credit, going concern threats to major multinational companies and medium and small businesses, poor liquidity, reduced corporate profitability, volatility in credit, equity and foreign exchange markets and bankruptcies. These conditions affect the rate of information technology spending and could adversely affect our customers ability or willingness to purchase our enterprise cloud computing application service, delay prospective customers purchasing decisions, reduce the value or duration of their subscription contracts, or affect renewal rates, all of which could adversely affect our operating results. Because we recognize revenue from subscriptions for our service over the term of the subscription, downturns or upturns in sales may not be immediately reflected in our operating results. We generally recognize revenue from customers ratably over the terms of their subscription agreements, which are typically 12 to 24 months, although terms can range from one to 60 months. As a result, most of the revenue we report in each quarter is derived from the recognition of deferred revenue relating to subscription agreements entered into during previous quarters. Consequently, a decline in new or renewed subscriptions in any one quarter may not be immediately reflected in our revenue results for that quarter. Such a decline, however, will negatively affect our revenue in future quarters. Accordingly, the effect of significant downturns in sales and market acceptance of our service, and potential changes in our rate of renewals may not be fully reflected in our results of operations until future periods. Our subscription model also makes it difficult for us to rapidly increase our revenue through additional sales in any period, as revenue from new customers must be  recognized over the applicable subscription term. In addition, we may be unable to adjust our cost structure to reflect the changes in revenues. We cannot accurately predict subscription renewal or upgrade rates and the impact these rates may have on our future revenue and operating results. Our customers have no obligation to renew their subscriptions for our service after the expiration of their initial subscription period, which is typically 12 to 24 months, and in fact, some customers have elected not to renew. In addition, our customers may renew for fewer subscriptions, renew for shorter contract lengths, or renew for lower cost editions of our service. We cannot accurately predict renewal rates, particularly for our enterprise customers who purchase a large number of subscriptions under multi-year contracts and for our small and medium size business customers. Our renewal rates may decline or fluctuate as a result of a number of factors, including customer dissatisfaction with our service, customers ability to continue their operations and spending levels, decreases in the number of users at our customers and deteriorating general economic conditions. If our customers do not renew their subscriptions for our service or reduce the number of paying subscriptions at the time of renewal, our revenue will decline and our business will suffer. Our future success also depends in part on our ability to sell additional features and services, more subscriptions or enhanced editions of our service to our current customers. This may also require increasingly sophisticated and costly sales efforts that are targeted at senior management. Similarly, the rate at which our customers purchase new or enhanced services depends on a number of factors, including general economic conditions. If our efforts to upsell to our customers are not successful, our business may suffer. If we experience significant fluctuations in our rate of anticipated growth and fail to balance our expenses with our revenue forecasts, our results could be harmed. Due to our evolving business model, the unpredictability of new markets that we enter and the unpredictability of future general economic and financial market conditions, we may not be able to accurately forecast our rate of growth. We plan our expense levels and investment on estimates of future revenue and future anticipated rate of growth. We may not be able to adjust our spending quickly enough if the addition of new subscriptions or the renewal rate for existing subscriptions falls short of our expectations. As a result, we expect that our revenues, operating results and cash flows may fluctuate significantly on a quarterly basis. Our recent revenue growth rates may not be sustainable and may decline in the future. We believe that period-to-period comparisons of our revenues, operating results and cash flows may not be meaningful and should not be relied upon as an indication of future performance. We have been and may in the future be sued by third parties for alleged infringement of their proprietary rights. The software and Internet industries are characterized by the existence of a large number of patents, trademarks and copyrights and by frequent litigation based on allegations of infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights. We have received in the past and may receive in the future communications from third parties claiming that we have infringed the intellectual property rights of others. During fiscal 2009, we received a communication from a large technology company alleging that we were infringing some of their patents. We continue to analyze the potential merits of their claims, the potential defenses to such claims and potential counter claims, and the possibility of a license agreement as an alternative to litigation. We are currently in discussions with this company and no litigation has been filed to date. However, there can be no assurance that this claim will not lead to litigation in the future. The resolution of this claim is not expected to have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, but it could be material to the net income or cash flows or both of a particular quarter. We have been, and may in the future be, sued by third parties for alleged infringement of their proprietary rights. Our technologies may not be able to withstand any third-party claims  against their use. The outcome of any litigation is inherently uncertain. Any intellectual property claims, including the one referenced above, with or without merit, could be time-consuming and expensive to resolve, could divert management attention from executing our business plan and could require us to change our technology, change our business practices and/or pay monetary damages or enter into short- or long-term royalty or licensing agreements which may not be available in the future at the same terms or at all. In addition, many of our subscription agreements require us to indemnify our customers for third-party intellectual property infringement claims, which would increase the cost to us of an adverse ruling on such a claim. Any adverse determination related to intellectual property claims or litigation could prevent us from offering our service to others, or could otherwise adversely affect our operating results or cash flows or both in a particular quarter. Our quarterly results can fluctuate and our stock price and the value of your investment could decline substantially. Our quarterly operating results are likely to fluctuate. For example, our fourth quarter has historically been our strongest quarter for new business and renewals. The year-over-year compounding effect of this seasonality in billing patterns and overall new business and renewal activity causes the value of invoices that we generate in the fourth quarter to continually increase in proportion to our billings in the other three quarters of our fiscal year. Additionally, some of the important factors that may cause our revenues, operating results and cash flows to fluctuate from quarter to quarter include: ##TABLE_START    our ability to retain and increase sales to existing customers, attract new customers and satisfy our customers requirements; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    the renewal rates for our service; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    the amount and timing of operating costs and capital expenditures related to the operations and expansion of our business; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    the number of new employees added; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    changes in our pricing policies whether initiated by us or as a result of intense competition; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    the cost, timing and management effort for the introduction of new features to our service; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    the rate of expansion and productivity of our sales force; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    the length of the sales cycle for our service; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    new product and service introductions by our competitors; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    our success in selling our service to large enterprises; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    variations in the revenue mix of editions of our service; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    technical difficulties or interruptions in our service; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    expenses related to increasing our data center capacity and expanding our data centers domestically and internationally; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    changes in foreign currency exchange rates; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    changes in interest rates and our mix of investments, which would impact our return on our investments in cash and marketable securities; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    conditions, particularly sudden changes, in the financial markets have and may continue to impact the value of and access to our investment portfolio; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    changes in the effective tax rates; ##TABLE_END  ##TABLE_START    general economic conditions that may adversely affect either our customers ability or willingness to purchase additional subscriptions or upgrade their service, or delay a prospective customers purchasing decision, or reduce the value of new subscription contracts, or affect renewal rates; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    timing of additional investments in our enterprise cloud computing application service and in our consulting service; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    changes in deferred revenue balances due to the seasonal nature of our customer invoicing, changes in the average duration of our invoices, rate of renewals and the rate of new business growth; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    regulatory compliance costs; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    the timing of customer payments and payment defaults by customers; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    costs associated with acquisitions of companies and technologies; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    extraordinary expenses such as litigation or other dispute-related settlement payments; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    the impact of new accounting pronouncements; and ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    the timing of stock awards to employees and the related adverse financial statement impact of having to expense those stock awards ratably over their vesting schedules. ##TABLE_END Many of these factors are not within our control, and the occurrence of one or more of them might cause our operating results to vary widely. As such, we believe that quarter-to-quarter comparisons of our revenues, operating results and cash flows may not be meaningful and should not be relied upon as an indication of future performance. Additionally, we may also fail to meet or exceed the expectations of securities analysts or investors, and the market price of our common stock. Moreover, our stock price may be based on expectations of our future performance that may be unrealistic or that may not be met. As we acquire companies or technologies in the future, they could prove difficult to integrate, disrupt our business, dilute stockholder value and adversely affect our operating results and the value of your investment. As part of our business strategy, we regularly evaluate investments in, or acquisitions of, complementary businesses, joint ventures, services and technologies, and we expect that periodically we will continue to make such investments and acquisitions in the future. Acquisitions and investments involve numerous risks, including: ##TABLE_START    the potential failure to achieve the expected benefits of the combination or acquisition; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    difficulties in and the cost of integrating operations, technologies, services and personnel; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    diversion of financial and managerial resources from existing operations; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    risk of entering new markets in which we have little or no experience; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    potential write-offs of acquired assets or investments; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    potential loss of key employees; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    inability to generate sufficient revenue to offset acquisition or investment costs; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    the inability to maintain relationships with customers and partners of the acquired business; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    the difficulty of incorporating acquired technology and rights into our products and services and of maintaining quality standards consistent with our brand; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    potential unknown liabilities associated with the acquired businesses; ##TABLE_END  ##TABLE_START    unanticipated expenses related to acquired technology and its integration into existing technology; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    negative impact to our results of operations because of the depreciation and amortization of amounts related to acquired intangible assets, fixed assets and deferred compensation, and the loss of acquired deferred revenue; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    delays in customer purchases due to uncertainty related to any acquisition; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    the need to implement controls, procedures and policies appropriate for a public company at companies that prior to the acquisition lacked such controls, procedures and policies; and ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    challenges caused by distance, language and cultural differences. ##TABLE_END In addition, if we finance acquisitions by issuing equity or convertible debt securities, our existing stockholders may be diluted which could affect the market price of our common stock. Further, if we fail to properly evaluate and execute acquisitions or investments, our business and prospects may be seriously harmed and the value of your investment may decline. We rely on third-party computer hardware and software that may be difficult to replace or which could cause errors or failures of our service. We rely on computer hardware purchased or leased and software licensed from third parties in order to offer our service, including database software from Oracle Corporation. This hardware and software may not continue to be available at reasonable prices or on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. Any loss of the right to use any of this hardware or software could significantly increase our expenses and otherwise result in delays in the provisioning of our service until equivalent technology is either developed by us, or, if available, is identified, obtained and integrated, which could harm our business. Any errors or defects in third-party hardware or software could result in errors or a failure of our service which could harm our business. If the market for our technology delivery model and an enterprise cloud computing application service develops more slowly than we expect, our business could be harmed. The market for enterprise cloud computing application services is not as mature as the market for packaged enterprise software, and it is uncertain whether these services will achieve and sustain high levels of demand and market acceptance. Our success will depend to a substantial extent on the willingness of enterprises, large and small, to increase their use of enterprise cloud computing application services in general, and for CRM in particular. Many enterprises have invested substantial personnel and financial resources to integrate traditional enterprise software into their businesses, and therefore may be reluctant or unwilling to migrate to an enterprise cloud computing application service. Furthermore, some enterprises may be reluctant or unwilling to use enterprise cloud computing application services because they have concerns regarding the risks associated with security capabilities, among other things, of the technology delivery model associated with these services. If enterprises do not perceive the benefits of enterprise cloud computing application services, then the market for these services may not develop at all, or it may develop more slowly than we expect, either of which would significantly adversely affect our operating results. In addition, we may make errors in predicting and reacting to relevant business trends, which could harm our business. Our success also depends on the willingness of third-party developers to build applications that are complementary to our service. Without the development of these applications, both current and potential customers may not find our service sufficiently attractive. In addition, for those customers who authorize third-party technology partners access to their data, we do not warrant the functionality, security and integrity of the data transmission or processing. Despite contract provisions to protect us, customers may look to us to support and warrant the third-party applications, which may expose us to potential claims, liabilities and obligations for applications we did not develop or sell.  The market in which we participate is intensely competitive, and if we do not compete effectively, our operating results could be harmed. The market for enterprise CRM business applications and development platforms is highly competitive, rapidly evolving and fragmented, and subject to changing technology, shifting customer needs and frequent introductions of new products and services. We compete primarily with vendors of packaged CRM software, whose software is installed by the customer directly, and companies offering on-demand CRM applications. We also compete with internally developed applications and face, or expect to face, competition from enterprise software vendors and online service providers who may develop toolsets and products that allow customers to build new applications that run on the customers current infrastructure or as hosted services. Our current principal competitors include: ##TABLE_START    enterprise software application vendors including Microsoft Corporation, Oracle Corporation, and SAP AG; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    on-demand CRM application service providers such as Microsoft Corporation, NetSuite, Inc., Oracle Corporation, RightNow Technologies, Inc. and SAP AG; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    enterprise application service providers including IBM Corporation and Oracle Corporation; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    traditional platform development environment companies, including established vendors, such as IBM Corporation, Microsoft Corporation, and Oracle Corporation; and ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    cloud computing development platform companies, including some with whom we are partners, others such as Microsoft Corporation, which has initiated plans to enter this market, and a variety of smaller start up companies that have invested in cloud computing technology. ##TABLE_END Many of our potential competitors enjoy substantial competitive advantages, such as greater name recognition, longer operating histories and larger marketing budgets, as well as substantially greater financial, technical and other resources. In addition, many of our potential competitors have established marketing relationships and access to larger customer bases, and have major distribution agreements with consultants, system integrators and resellers. As a result, our competitors may be able to respond more quickly and effectively than we can to new or changing opportunities, technologies, standards or customer requirements. Furthermore, because of these advantages, even if our service is more effective than the products that our competitors offer, potential customers might accept competitive products and services in lieu of purchasing our service. For all of these reasons, we may not be able to compete successfully against our current and future competitors. Our efforts to expand our service beyond the CRM market may not succeed and may reduce our revenue growth rate. We derive substantially all of our revenue from subscriptions to our CRM enterprise cloud computing application service, and we expect this will continue for the foreseeable future. The market for our Force.com cloud computing platform is new and it is uncertain whether our efforts will ever result in significant revenue for us. Our efforts to expand our service beyond the CRM market may not succeed and may reduce our revenue growth rate. Supporting our existing and growing customer base could strain our personnel resources and infrastructure, and if we are unable to scale our operations and increase productivity, we may not be able to successfully implement our business plan. Since we were formed in 1999, we have experienced significant growth in our customer base, which has placed a strain on our management, administrative, operational and financial infrastructure. We anticipate that additional investments in our infrastructure and research and development spending will be required to scale our  operations and increase productivity, to address the needs of our customers, to further develop and enhance our service, and to expand into new geographic areas. Our success will depend in part upon the ability of our senior management to manage our projected growth effectively. To do so, we must continue to increase the productivity of our existing employees and to hire, train and manage new employees as needed. To manage the expected domestic and international growth of our operations and personnel, we will need to continue to improve our operational, financial and management controls and our reporting systems and procedures. The additional investments we are making will increase our cost base, which will make it more difficult for us to offset any future revenue shortfalls by reducing expenses in the short term. If we fail to successfully scale our operations and increase productivity, we will be unable to execute our business plan. As more of our sales efforts are targeted at larger enterprise customers, our sales cycle may become more time-consuming and expensive, we may encounter pricing pressure and implementation challenges, and we may have to delay revenue recognition for some complex transactions, all of which could harm our business and operating results. As we target more of our sales efforts at larger enterprise customers, we will face greater costs, longer sales cycles and less predictability in completing some of our sales. In this market segment, the customers decision to use our service may be an enterprise-wide decision and, if so, these types of sales would require us to provide greater levels of education regarding the use and benefits of our service, as well as education regarding privacy and data protection laws and regulations to prospective customers with international operations. In addition, larger customers may demand more customization, integration services and features. As a result of these factors, these sales opportunities may require us to devote greater sales support and professional services resources to individual customers, driving up costs and time required to complete sales and diverting sales and professional services resources to a smaller number of larger transactions, while potentially requiring us to delay revenue recognition on some of these transactions until the technical or implementation requirements have been met. Periodic restructurings of our sales organization can be disruptive and may negatively impact our revenues. We periodically restructure or make other adjustments to our sales organization in response to market opportunities, competitive threats, management changes, product introductions or enhancements, sales performance, increases in sales headcount, cost levels, and other internal and external considerations. In the past, these restructurings sometimes resulted in a temporary lack of focus and reduced productivity; these effects could recur in connection with any future sales restructurings we might undertake and our rate of revenue growth could be negatively affected. If we are not able to develop enhancements and new features to our existing service or acceptable new services that keep pace with technological developments, our business will be harmed. If we are unable to develop enhancements to and new features for our existing service or acceptable new services that keep pace with rapid technological developments, our business will be harmed. The success of enhancements, new features and services depends on several factors, including the timely completion, introduction and market acceptance of the feature or edition. Failure in this regard may significantly impair our revenue growth. In addition, because our service is designed to operate on a variety of network hardware and software platforms using a standard browser, we will need to continuously modify and enhance our service to keep pace with changes in Internet-related hardware, software, communication, browser and database technologies. We may not be successful in either developing these modifications and enhancements or in timely bringing them to market. Furthermore, uncertainties about the timing and nature of new network platforms or technologies, or modifications to existing platforms or technologies, could increase our research and development expenses. Any failure of our service to operate effectively with future network platforms and technologies could reduce the demand for our service, result in customer dissatisfaction and harm our business.  Our business could be adversely affected if our customers are not satisfied with implementation and customization services provided by us or our partners. Our business depends on our ability to satisfy our customers, both with respect to our CRM service and platform and the professional services that customize our CRM service and platform to meet our customers business needs. Professional services may be performed by our own staff, or by a third party or a combination of the two. Our strategy is to work with third parties to increase the breadth of capability and depth of capacity for delivery of these services to our customers. If a customer is not satisfied with the quality of work performed by us or a third party or with the type of services or solutions delivered, then we could incur additional costs to address the situation, the profitability of that work might be impaired, and the customers dissatisfaction with our services could damage our ability to obtain additional work from that customer. In addition, negative publicity related to our customer relationships, regardless of its accuracy, may further damage our business by affecting our ability to compete for new business with current and prospective customers. Any failure to protect our intellectual property rights could impair our ability to protect our proprietary technology and our brand. If we fail to protect our intellectual property rights adequately, our competitors might gain access to our technology, and our business might be harmed. In addition, defending our intellectual property rights might entail significant expense. Any of our trademarks or other intellectual property rights may be challenged by others or invalidated through administrative process or litigation. While we have a few U.S. patents and many U.S. and international patent applications pending, we may be unable to obtain patent protection for the technology covered in our patent applications. In addition, our existing patents and any patents issued in the future may not provide us with competitive advantages, or may be successfully challenged by third parties. Furthermore, legal standards relating to the validity, enforceability and scope of protection of intellectual property rights are uncertain. Effective patent, trademark, copyright and trade secret protection may not be available to us in every country in which our service is available. The laws of some foreign countries may not be as protective of intellectual property rights as those in the U.S., and mechanisms for enforcement of intellectual property rights may be inadequate. Accordingly, despite our efforts, we may be unable to prevent third parties from infringing upon or misappropriating our intellectual property. We might be required to spend significant resources to monitor and protect our intellectual property rights. We may initiate claims or litigation against third parties for infringement of our proprietary rights or to establish the validity of our proprietary rights. Any litigation, whether or not it is resolved in our favor, could result in significant expense to us and divert the efforts of our technical and management personnel. If we fail to develop our brands, our business may suffer. We believe that developing and maintaining awareness of the salesforce.com brand and our other brands is critical to achieving widespread acceptance of our existing and future services and is an important element in attracting new customers. In the past, our efforts to build our brands have involved significant expense. Brand promotion activities may not yield increased revenue, and even if they do, any increased revenue may not offset the expenses we incurred in building our brands. If we fail to successfully promote and maintain our brands, or incur substantial expenses in an unsuccessful attempt to promote and maintain our brands, we may fail to attract enough new customers or retain our existing customers to the extent necessary to realize a sufficient return on our brand-building efforts, and our business could suffer. Sales to customers outside the United States expose us to risks inherent in international sales. Because we sell our service throughout the world, we are subject to risks and challenges that we would otherwise not face if we conducted our business only in the United States. For example, sales in Europe and Asia Pacific together represented approximately 30 percent of our total revenues for the year ended January 31, 2010,  and we intend to continue to expand our international sales efforts. The risks and challenges associated with sales to customers outside the United States include: ##TABLE_START    localization of our service, including translation into foreign languages and associated expenses; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    laws and business practices favoring local competitors; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    compliance with multiple, conflicting and changing governmental laws and regulations, including employment, tax, privacy and data protection laws and regulations; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    treatment of revenue from international sources and changes to tax codes, including being subject to foreign tax laws and being liable for paying withholding income or other taxes in foreign jurisdictions; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    regional data privacy laws that apply to the transmission of our customers data across international borders; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    foreign currency fluctuations and controls; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    different pricing environments; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    different or lesser protection of our intellectual property; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    longer accounts receivable payment cycles and other collection difficulties; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    regional economic conditions; and ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    regional political conditions. ##TABLE_END Any of these factors could negatively impact our business and results of operations. Additionally, our international subscription fees are paid either in U.S. dollars or local currency. As a result, fluctuations in the value of the U.S. dollar and foreign currencies may make our service more expensive for international customers, which could harm our business. Evolving regulation of the Internet may affect us adversely. As Internet commerce continues to evolve, increasing regulation by federal, state or foreign agencies becomes more likely. For example, we believe increased regulation is likely in the area of data privacy, and laws and regulations applying to the solicitation, collection, processing or use of personal or consumer information could affect our customers ability to use and share data, potentially reducing demand for CRM solutions and restricting our ability to store, process and share data with our customers. In addition, taxation of services provided over the Internet or other charges imposed by government agencies or by private organizations for accessing the Internet may also be imposed. Any regulation imposing greater fees for Internet use or restricting information exchange over the Internet could result in a decline in the use of the Internet and the viability of Internet-based services, which could harm our business. Privacy concerns and laws or other domestic or foreign regulations may reduce the effectiveness of our solution and adversely affect our business. Our customers can use our service to store contact and other personal or identifying information regarding their customers and contacts. Federal, state and foreign government bodies and agencies have adopted or are considering adopting laws and regulations regarding the collection, use and disclosure of personal information obtained from consumers and individuals. The costs of compliance with, and other burdens imposed by, such laws and regulations that are applicable to the businesses of our customers may limit the use and adoption of our service and reduce overall demand for it, or lead to significant fines, penalties or liabilities for any noncompliance with such privacy laws. Furthermore, privacy concerns may cause our customers customers to  resist providing the personal data necessary to allow our customers to use our service effectively. Even the perception of privacy concerns, whether or not valid, may inhibit market adoption of our service in certain industries. For example, in the United States regulations such as the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, which protects and restricts the use of consumer credit and financial information, and the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, which regulates the use and disclosure of personal health information, impose significant requirements and obligations on businesses that may affect the use and adoption of our service. The European Union has also adopted a data privacy directive that requires member states to impose restrictions on the collection and use of personal data that, in some respects, are far more stringent, and impose more significant burdens on subject businesses, than current privacy standards in the United States. All of these domestic and international legislative and regulatory initiatives may adversely affect our customers ability to collect and/or use demographic and personal information from their customers, which could reduce demand for our service. Many other jurisdictions have similar stringent privacy laws and regulations. In addition to government activity, privacy advocacy groups and the technology and other industries are considering various new, additional or different self-regulatory standards that may place additional burdens on us. If the gathering of personal information were to be curtailed in this manner, CRM solutions would be less effective, which may reduce demand for our service and harm our business. We are dependent on our management team and development and operations personnel, and the loss of one or more key employees or groups could harm our business and prevent us from implementing our business plan in a timely manner. Our success depends substantially upon the continued services of our executive officers and other key members of management, particularly our Chief Executive Officer. From time to time, there may be changes in our executive management team resulting from the hiring or departure of executives. Such changes in our executive management team may be disruptive to our business. We are also substantially dependent on the continued service of our existing development and operations personnel because of the complexity of our service and technologies. We do not have employment agreements with any of our executive officers, key management, development or operations personnel and, therefore, they could terminate their employment with us at any time. We do not maintain key person life insurance policies on any of our employees. The loss of one or more of our key employees or groups could seriously harm our business. Because competition for our target employees is intense, we may not be able to attract and retain the highly skilled employees we need to support our operations and growing customer base. In the technology industry, there is substantial and continuous competition for engineers with high levels of experience in designing, developing and managing software and Internet-related services, as well as competition for sales executives and operations personnel. We may not be successful in attracting and retaining qualified personnel. We have from time to time experienced, and we expect to continue to experience, difficulty in hiring and retaining highly skilled employees with appropriate qualifications. In addition, job candidates and existing employees often consider the value of the stock awards they receive in connection with their employment. If our stock price performs poorly, it may adversely affect our ability to retain highly skilled employees. In addition, since we expense all stock-based compensation, we may periodically change our stock compensation practices, which may include reducing the number of employees eligible for options or reducing the size of equity awards granted per employee. If we fail to attract new personnel or fail to retain and motivate our current personnel, our business and future growth prospects could be severely harmed.  Our business is subject to changing regulations regarding corporate governance and public disclosure that have increased both our costs and the risk of non-compliance. We are subject to rules and regulations by various governing bodies, including, for example, the Securities and Exchange Commission, which are charged with the protection of investors and the oversight of companies whose securities are publicly traded. Our efforts to comply with new and changing regulations have resulted in and are likely to continue to result in, increased general and administrative expenses and a diversion of management time and attention from revenue-generating activities to compliance activities. Moreover, because these laws, regulations and standards are subject to varying interpretations, their application in practice may evolve over time as new guidance becomes available. This evolution may result in continuing uncertainty regarding compliance matters and additional costs necessitated by ongoing revisions to our disclosure and governance practices. If we fail to address and comply with these regulations and any subsequent changes, our business may be harmed. Unanticipated changes in our effective tax rate could adversely affect our future results. We are subject to income taxes in the United States and various foreign jurisdictions, and our domestic and international tax liabilities are subject to the allocation of expenses in differing jurisdictions. Our effective tax rate could be adversely affected by changes in the mix of earnings and losses in countries with differing statutory tax rates, certain non-deductible expenses arising from share-based compensation, the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities and changes in federal, state or international tax laws and accounting principles. Increases in our effective tax rate could materially affect our net results. In addition, we are subject to income tax audits by many tax jurisdictions throughout the world. Although we believe our income tax liabilities are reasonably estimated and accounted for in accordance with applicable laws and principles, an adverse resolution of one or more uncertain tax positions in any period could have a material impact on the results of operations for that period. Natural disasters and other events beyond our control could materially adversely affect us. Natural disasters or other catastrophic events may cause damage or disruption to our operations, international commerce and the global economy, and thus could have a strong negative effect on us. Our business operations are subject to interruption by natural disasters, fire, power shortages, pandemics and other events beyond our control. Although we maintain crisis management and disaster response plans, such events could make it difficult or impossible for us to deliver our services to our customers, and could decrease demand for our services. The majority of our research and development activities, corporate headquarters, information technology systems, and other critical business operations, are located near major seismic faults in the San Francisco Bay Area. Because we do not carry earthquake insurance for direct quake-related losses, and significant recovery time could be required to resume operations, our financial condition and operating results could be materially adversely affected in the event of a major earthquake or catastrophic event. Risks Relating to Ownership of Our Common Stock and our Convertible Senior Notes due 2015 The market price of our common stock is likely to be volatile and could subject us to litigation. The trading prices of the securities of technology companies have been highly volatile. Accordingly, the market price of our common stock has been and is likely to continue to be subject to wide fluctuations. Factors affecting the market price of our common stock include: ##TABLE_START    variations in our operating results, earnings per share, cash flows from operating activities, deferred revenue, and other financial metrics and non-financial metrics, and how those results compare to analyst expectations; ##TABLE_END  ##TABLE_START    forward looking guidance to industry and financial analysts related to future revenue and earnings per share; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    the net increases in the number of customers, either independently or as compared with published expectations of industry, financial or other analysts that cover our company; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    changes in the estimates of our operating results or changes in recommendations by securities analysts that elect to follow our common stock; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    announcements of technological innovations, new services or service enhancements, strategic alliances or significant agreements by us or by our competitors; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    announcements by us or by our competitors of mergers or other strategic acquisitions, or rumors of such transactions involving us or our competitors; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    announcements of customer additions and customer cancellations or delays in customer purchases; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    recruitment or departure of key personnel; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    disruptions in our service due to computer hardware, software or network problems; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    the economy as a whole, market conditions in our industry, and the industries of our customers; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    trading activity by a limited number of stockholders who together beneficially own a majority of our outstanding common stock; and ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    any other factors discussed herein. ##TABLE_END In addition, if the market for technology stocks or the stock market in general experiences uneven investor confidence, the market price of our common stock could decline for reasons unrelated to our business, operating results or financial condition. The market price of our common stock might also decline in reaction to events that affect other companies within, or outside, our industry even if these events do not directly affect us. Some companies that have experienced volatility in the trading price of their stock have been the subject of securities class action litigation. If we are subject of such litigation, it could result in substantial costs and a diversion of managements attention and resources. The concentration of our capital stock ownership with insiders will likely limit your ability to influence corporate matters. Our executive officers, directors, and several stockholders and their affiliated entities together beneficially own a majority of our outstanding common stock. As a result, these stockholders, if they act together or in a block, could have significant influence over most matters that require approval by our stockholders, including the election of directors and approval of significant corporate transactions, even if other stockholders oppose them. This concentration of ownership might also have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control of our company that other stockholders may view as beneficial. Provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws and Delaware law might discourage, delay or prevent a change of control of our company or changes in our management and, therefore, depress the market price of our common stock. Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that could depress the market price of our common stock by acting to discourage, delay or prevent a change in control of our company or changes in our management that the stockholders of our company may deem advantageous. These provisions among other things: ##TABLE_START    establish a classified board of directors so that not all members of our board are elected at one time; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    permit the board of directors to establish the number of directors; ##TABLE_END  ##TABLE_START    provide that directors may only be removed for cause and only with the approval of 66 2/3 percent of our stockholders; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    require super-majority voting to amend some provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    authorize the issuance of blank check preferred stock that our board could use to implement a stockholder rights plan (also known as a poison pill); ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    eliminate the ability of our stockholders to call special meetings of stockholders; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    prohibit stockholder action by written consent, which requires all stockholder actions to be taken at a meeting of our stockholders; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    provide that the board of directors is expressly authorized to make, alter or repeal our bylaws; and ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    establish advance notice requirements for nominations for election to our board or for proposing matters that can be acted upon by stockholders at annual stockholder meetings. ##TABLE_END In addition, Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law may discourage, delay or prevent a change in control of our company. Section 203 imposes certain restrictions on merger, business combinations and other transactions between us and holders of 15 percent or more of our common stock. Our debt service obligations may adversely affect our financial condition and cash flows from operations. As a result of our sale of $575.0 million of 0.75 percent convertible senior notes in January 2010 (the Notes), we now have long-term debt that we have not had to maintain in the past. Our maintenance of indebtedness could have important consequences because: ##TABLE_START    it may impair our ability to obtain additional financing in the future; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    an increased portion of our cash flows from operations may have to be dedicated towards repaying the principal in 2015; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    it may make us more vulnerable to downturns in our business, our industry or the economy in general. ##TABLE_END Our ability to meet our expenses and debt obligations will depend on our future performance, which will be affected by financial, business, economic, regulatory and other factors. We will not be able to control many of these factors, such as economic conditions and governmental regulations. Our operations may not generate sufficient cash to enable us to service our debt. If we fail to make a payment on our debt, we could be in default on such debt. We expect that the trading price of the Notes will be significantly affected by the market price of our common stock, which may be volatile, the general level of interest rates and our credit quality. The market price of our common stock, as well as the general level of interest rates and our credit quality, will likely significantly affect the trading price of the Notes. Our common stock has experienced significant price and volume fluctuations. We cannot predict whether the market price of our common stock will rise or fall. The market price of our common stock will be influenced by a number of factors, including general market conditions, variations in our operating results, earnings per share, cash flows, deferred revenue, other financial and non-financial metrics and other factors described in greater detail elsewhere in this section, many of which are beyond our control. The market price of our common stock also could be affected by possible sales of common stock by investors who view the Notes as an attractive means of equity participation in us and by hedging or arbitrage  activity involving our common stock that we expect to develop as a result of the issuance of the Notes. The hedging or arbitrage activity could, in turn, affect the trading prices of the Notes. We also cannot predict whether interest rates will rise or fall. During the term of the Notes, interest rates will be influenced by a number of factors, most of which are beyond our control. However, if interest rates increase, the option value of the Notes convertibility feature will increase, but the yield of the Notes will decrease, and if interest rates decrease, the option value of the Notes convertibility feature will decrease, but the yield of the notes will increase. In addition, our credit quality may vary substantially during the term of the Notes and will be influenced by a number of factors, including variations in our cash flows and the amount of indebtedness we have outstanding. Any decrease in our credit quality could negatively impact the trading price of the Notes. We may issue additional shares of our common stock or instruments convertible into shares of our common stock, including in connection with the conversion of the Notes, and thereby materially and adversely affect the market price of our common stock and the trading price of the Notes. We are not restricted from issuing additional shares of our common stock or other instruments convertible into, or exchangeable or exercisable for, shares of our common stock during the life of the Notes. If we issue additional shares of our common stock or instruments convertible into shares of our common stock, it may materially and adversely affect the market price of our common stock and, in turn, the trading price of the Notes. In addition, the conversion of some or all of the Notes may dilute the ownership interests of existing holders of our common stock, and any sales in the public market of any shares of our common stock issuable upon such conversion of the notes could adversely affect prevailing market price of our common stock. In addition, the anticipated conversion of the Notes could depress the market price of our common stock. The Notes and the indenture that will govern the Notes contain limited protections against certain types of important corporate events and may not protect your investment upon the occurrence of such corporate events and will not protect your investment upon the occurrence of other corporate events. The indenture for the Notes does not: ##TABLE_START    require us to maintain any financial ratios or specific levels of net worth, revenues, income, cash flows or liquidity; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    protect holders of the Notes in the event that we experience significant adverse changes in our financial condition or results of operations; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    limit our subsidiaries ability to incur indebtedness that would effectively rank senior to the Notes to the extent of the value of the assets securing the indebtedness; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    limit our ability to incur indebtedness that is equal in right of payment to the Notes; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    limit our ability to incur indebtedness with a maturity date earlier than the maturity date of the Notes; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    restrict our subsidiaries ability to issue securities or incur liability that would be structurally senior to our indebtedness; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    restrict our ability to purchase or prepay our securities; or ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    restrict our ability to make investments or to purchase or pay dividends or make other payments in respect of our common stock or other securities ranking junior to the Notes. ##TABLE_END Furthermore, the indenture for the Notes contains only limited protections in the event of a change in control. We could engage in many types of transactions, such as certain acquisitions, refinancings or recapitalizations, that could substantially affect our capital structure and the value of the Notes and our common  stock, but would not constitute a fundamental change that permits holders to require us to purchase their Notes under the indenture. We may not have the ability to raise the funds necessary to re-pay the Notes. There can be no assurance that we will have sufficient financial resources, or will be able to arrange financing, to pay the fundamental change purchase price if holders submit their Notes for purchase by us upon the occurrence of a fundamental change or to pay the amount of cash due if holders surrender their Notes for conversion. In addition, agreements governing any future debt may restrict our ability to make each of the required cash payments even if we have sufficient funds to make them. Furthermore, our ability to purchase the Notes or to pay cash upon the conversion of the Notes may be limited by law or regulatory authority. In addition, if we fail to purchase the Notes, to pay interest due on, or to pay the amount of cash due upon conversion, we will be in default under the indenture. Our inability to pay for the Notes that are tendered for purchase or upon conversion could result in receiving substantially less than the principal amount of the Notes. The fundamental change provisions may delay or prevent an otherwise beneficial takeover attempt of us. The fundamental change purchase rights, which will allow note holders to require us to purchase all or a portion of their Notes upon the occurrence of a fundamental change and the provisions requiring an increase to the conversion rate for conversions in connection with a make-whole fundamental change may in certain circumstances delay or prevent a takeover of us and the removal of incumbent management that might otherwise be beneficial to investors. The convertible note hedge and warrant transactions may affect the trading price of the Notes and the market price of our common stock. We entered into privately negotiated convertible note hedge transactions with the hedge counterparties concurrently with the issuance of the Notes. We also entered into privately negotiated warrant transactions with the hedge counterparties. Taken together, the convertible note hedge transactions and the warrant transactions are expected, but not guaranteed, to reduce the potential dilution with respect to our common stock upon conversion of the Notes. As the hedge counterparties and their respective affiliates modify their hedge positions from time to time by entering into or unwinding various over-the-counter derivative transactions with respect to our common stock, and/or by purchasing or selling shares of our common stock or the Notes in privately negotiated transactions and/or open market transactions, their activities could adversely affect the market price of our common stock and the trading price of the Notes. We are subject to counterparty risk with respect to the convertible note hedge transactions. The hedge counterparties are financial institutions or affiliates of financial institutions, and we will be subject to the risk that these hedge counterparties may default under the convertible note hedge transactions. Our exposure to the credit risk of the hedge counterparties will not be secured by any collateral. Recent global economic conditions have resulted in the actual or perceived failure or financial difficulties of many financial institutions. If one or more of the hedge counterparties to one or more of our convertible note hedge transactions becomes subject to insolvency proceedings, we may become an unsecured creditor in those proceedings with a claim equal to our exposure at the time under those transactions. Our exposure will depend on many factors but, generally, the increase in our exposure will be correlated to the increase in our stock price and in the volatility of our stock. In addition, upon a default by one of the hedge counterparties, we may suffer adverse tax consequences and dilution with respect to our common stock. We can provide no assurances as to the financial stability or viability of any of the hedge counterparties.  Our management will have broad discretion over the use of the proceeds from our debt issuance and might not apply the proceeds in ways that increase the value of your investment. Our management will have broad discretion to use the net proceeds from debt issuance, and you will be relying on the judgment of our management regarding the application of these proceeds. They might not apply the net proceeds of this offering in ways that increase the value of your investment. We expect to use the net proceeds from this offering for general corporate purposes, including possible investments in, or acquisitions of, complementary businesses, joint ventures, services or technologies, working capital and capital expenditures; however, other than paying the cost of the convertible note hedge (after taking into account the proceeds from the warrant transactions), we have not allocated these net proceeds for any specific purposes. Our management might not be able to yield a significant return, if any, on any investment of these net proceeds. ##TABLE_START ", "1B": " ITEM 1B.

PROPERTIES ##TABLE_END Our executive offices and principal office for domestic marketing, sales, professional services and development occupy over 400,000 square feet in San Francisco, California under leases that expire at various times through November 2017. We also lease space in various locations throughout the United States for local sales and professional services personnel. Our foreign subsidiaries lease office space for their operations including local sales and professional services personnel. We believe that our existing facilities and offices are adequate to meet our current requirements. See Note 8, Commitments, in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information about our lease commitments. If we require additional space, we believe that we will be able to obtain such space on acceptable, commercially reasonable terms. ##TABLE_START ", "3": " ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS ##TABLE_END We are involved in various legal proceedings and receive claims from time to time, arising from the normal course of business activities. In our opinion, resolution of these matters is not expected to have a material adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations, cash flows or our financial position. During fiscal 2009, we received a communication from a large technology company alleging that we infringed some of their patents. We continue to analyze the potential merits of these claims, the potential defenses to such claims and potential counter claims, and the possibility of a license agreement as an alternative to litigation. We are currently in discussions with this company and no litigation has been filed to date. However, there can be no assurance that this claim will not lead to litigation in the future. The resolution of this claim is not expected to have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, but it could be material to the net income or cash flows or both of a particular quarter. We have been, and may in the future be, sued by third parties for alleged infringement of their proprietary rights. Our technologies may be subject to injunctions if they are held to infringe the rights of a third party. The outcome of any litigation is inherently uncertain. Any intellectual property claims, including the one referenced above, with or without merit, could be time-consuming and expensive to resolve, could divert management attention from executing our business plan and could require us to change our technology, change our business practices and/or pay monetary damages or enter into short- or long-term royalty or licensing agreements which may not be available in the future at the same terms or at all. ##TABLE_START ", "4": "", "5": " ITEM 5.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS ##TABLE_END The following discussion contains forward-looking statements, including, without limitation, our expectations regarding our outlook and future revenues, expenses, results of operations and liquidity. Our actual results may differ significantly from those projected in the forward-looking statements. Factors that might cause future actual results to differ materially from our recent results or those projected in the forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, those discussed in the section titled Risk Factors. Except as required by law, we assume no obligation to update the forward-looking statements or our risk factors for any reason. Overview We are a leading provider of enterprise cloud computing applications. We provide a comprehensive customer and collaboration relationship management, or CRM, service to businesses of all sizes and industries worldwide and we provide a technology platform for customers and developers to build and run business applications. We were founded in February 1999 and began offering our enterprise CRM application service in February 2000. Our objective is to be the leading provider of CRM application services and to be the leading platform on which our customers and partners build cloud computing applications. Key elements of our strategy include: ##TABLE_START    Strengthening our existing CRM applications and extending into new functional areas within CRM; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    Pursuing new customers and new territories aggressively; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    Deepening relationships with our existing customer base; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    Continuing to lead the industry transformation to cloud computing; and ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    Encouraging the development of third-party applications on our Force.com platform. ##TABLE_END We believe the factors that will influence our ability to achieve our objectives include our prospective customers willingness to migrate to an enterprise cloud computing application service; the performance and security of our service; our ability to continue to release, and gain customer acceptance of new and improved features; successful customer adoption and utilization of our service; acceptance of our service in markets where we have few customers; the emergence of additional competitors in our market and improved product offerings by existing and new competitors; the location of new data centers; third-party developers willingness to develop applications on our platform; and general economic conditions which could affect our customers ability and willingness to purchase our application service, delay the customers purchasing decision or affect renewal rates. To address these factors, we will need to, among other things, continue to add substantial numbers of paying subscriptions, upgrade our customers to fully featured versions such as our Unlimited Edition, provide high quality technical support to our customers and encourage the development of third-party applications on our Force.com platform. We also plan to invest for future growth by expanding our data center capacity. We also plan to hire additional personnel, particularly in direct sales, other customer-related areas and research and development. As part of our growth plans we will have additional focus in the area of retaining customers at the time of renewal. We also plan to: expand our domestic and international selling and marketing activities; add additional distribution channels; increase our research and development activities to upgrade and extend our service offerings and to develop new services and technologies; expand our focus in the locations around the world where we conduct business; and add to our infrastructure to support our growth. We also regularly evaluate acquisitions or investment opportunities in complementary businesses, joint ventures, services and technologies in an effort to strengthen and extend our service CRM offerings. We expect to continue to make such investments and acquisitions in the future.  In fiscal 2010, we issued at par $575.0 million 0.75% convertible senior notes due on January 15, 2015. In connection with the issuance of the debt, we entered into convertible note hedge transactions that cover the number of shares of our common stock that are underlying the notes. The note hedges transactions are designed, but not guaranteed, to reduce or eliminate the potential economic dilution arising upon conversion. Separately, we also entered into warrant transactions, whereby we sold warrants to acquire, subject to anti-dilution adjustments, shares of our common stock at a strike price of $119.51. We expect marketing and sales costs, which were 46 percent of our total revenues for fiscal 2010 and 50 percent for the same period a year ago, to continue to represent a substantial portion of total revenues in the future as we seek to add and manage more paying subscribers, and build brand awareness. Fiscal Year Our fiscal year ends on January 31. References to fiscal 2010, for example, refer to the fiscal year ended January 31, 2010. Sources of Revenues We derive our revenues from two sources: (1) subscription revenues, which are comprised of subscription fees from customers accessing our enterprise cloud computing application service, and from customers purchasing additional support beyond the standard support that is included in the basic subscription fee; and (2) related professional services and other revenues consisting primarily of training fees. Subscription and support revenues accounted for approximately 93 percent of our total revenues during fiscal 2010. Subscription revenues are driven primarily by the number of paying subscribers of our service and the subscription price of our service. None of our customers accounted for more than 5 percent of our revenues during fiscal 2010, 2009 and 2008. Subscription and support revenues are recognized ratably over the contract terms beginning on the commencement dates of each contract. The typical subscription and support term is 12 to 24 months, although terms range from one to 60 months. Our subscription and support contracts are noncancelable, though customers typically have the right to terminate their contracts for cause if we materially fail to perform. We generally invoice our customers in advance, in annual or quarterly installments, and typical payment terms provide that our customers pay us within 30 days of invoice. Amounts that have been invoiced are recorded in accounts receivable and in deferred revenue, or in revenue depending on whether the revenue recognition criteria have been met. In general, we collect our billings in advance of the subscription service period. Professional services and other revenues consist of fees associated with consulting and implementation services and training. Our consulting and implementation engagements are typically billed on a time and materials basis. We also offer a number of classes on implementing, using and administering our service that are billed on a per person, per class basis. Our typical payment terms provide that our customers pay us within 30 days of invoice. We generally recognize revenue ratably over the contract terms beginning on the commencement date of each contract. In determining whether professional services can be accounted for separately from subscription and support revenues, we consider a number of factors, which are described in Critical Accounting Policies and EstimatesRevenue Recognition below. As we introduce new service offerings, we may not be able to establish objective and reliable evidence of fair value for these elements of our sales arrangements. As a result, when the professional services are sold together with subscription services that do not have objective and reliable evidence of fair value, the professional services fees cannot be accounted for separately, and the entire arrangement is accounted for as a single unit of accounting. In such situations, we recognize the entire arrangement fee ratably over the term of the subscription contract. Approximately 6 percent and 7 percent of our total deferred revenue as of January 31, 2010 and 2009 respectively, related to deferred professional services revenue.  Seasonal Nature of Deferred Revenue and Accounts Receivable Deferred revenue primarily consists of billings to customers for our subscription service. Over 90 percent of the value of our billings to customers is for our subscription and support service. We generally invoice our customers in either quarterly or annual cycles, with a disproportionate weighting towards annual billings in the fourth quarter, primarily as a result of large enterprise account buying patterns. Additionally, our fourth quarter has historically been our strongest quarter for new business. The year on year compounding effect of this seasonality in both billing patterns and overall new business is causing the value of invoices that we generate in the fourth quarter for both new and existing customers to increase as a proportion of our total annual billings. Accordingly, the sequential quarterly changes in accounts receivable and the related deferred revenue during the first three quarters of our fiscal year are not necessarily indicative of the billing activity that occurs in the fourth quarter. ##TABLE_START (in thousands)  April 30, 2009  July 31, 2009  October 31, 2009  January 31, 2010 Fiscal 2010     Accounts receivable, net  $ 145,869  $ 168,842  $ 191,297  $ 320,956 Deferred revenue, current and noncurrent   549,373   549,010   545,435   704,348   April 30, 2008  July 31, 2008  October 31, 2008  January 31, 2009 Fiscal 2009     Accounts receivable, net  $ 143,909  $ 146,982  $ 157,680  $ 266,555 Deferred revenue, current and noncurrent   470,297   479,546   469,534   594,026   April 30, 2007  July 31, 2007  October 31, 2007  January 31, 2008 Fiscal 2008     Accounts receivable, net  $ 105,013  $ 114,046  $ 121,961  $ 220,061 Deferred revenue, current and noncurrent   295,672   321,852   340,808   480,894 ##TABLE_END Cost of Revenues and Operating Expenses Cost of Revenues. Cost of subscription and support revenues primarily consists of expenses related to hosting our service and providing support, the costs of data center capacity, depreciation or operating lease expense associated with computer equipment, allocated overhead and amortization expense associated with capitalized software related to our application service and acquired technology. We allocate overhead such as rent and occupancy charges based on headcount. Employee benefit costs and taxes are allocated based upon a percentage of total compensation expense. As such, general overhead expenses are reflected in each cost of revenue and operating expense category. Cost of professional services and other revenues consists primarily of employee-related costs associated with these services, including stock-based expenses, the cost of subcontractors and allocated overhead. The cost of providing professional services is significantly higher as a percentage of revenue than for our enterprise cloud computing subscription service due to the direct labor costs. We intend to continue to invest additional resources in our enterprise cloud computing application service. The timing of these additional expenses will affect our cost of revenues, both in terms of absolute dollars and as a percentage of revenues, in a particular quarterly period. Research and Development . Research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries and related expenses, including stock-based expenses, the costs of our development and test data center and allocated overhead. We continue to focus our research and development efforts on increasing the functionality and enhancing the ease of use of our enterprise cloud computing application service. Our proprietary, scalable and  secure multi-tenant architecture enables us to provide all of our customers with a service based on a single version of our application. As a result, we do not have to maintain multiple versions, which enables us to have relatively lower research and development expenses as compared to traditional enterprise software companies. We expect that in the future, research and development expenses will increase in absolute dollars as we upgrade and extend our service offerings and develop new technologies. Marketing and Sales. Marketing and sales expenses are our largest cost and consist primarily of salaries and related expenses, including stock-based expenses, for our sales and marketing staff, referral fees paid to partners, the cost of marketing programs and allocated overhead. Marketing programs consist of advertising, events, corporate communications and brand building and product marketing activities. We plan to continue to invest heavily in marketing and sales by increasing the number of direct sales personnel in order to add new customers and increase penetration within our existing customer base, expanding our domestic and international selling and marketing activities, building brand awareness and sponsoring additional marketing events. We expect that in the future, marketing and sales expenses will increase in absolute dollars and continue to be our largest cost. General and Administrative. General and administrative expenses consist of salaries and related expenses, including stock-based expenses, for finance and accounting, human resources and management information systems personnel, legal costs, professional fees, other corporate expenses and allocated overhead. We expect that in the future, general and administrative expenses will increase in absolute dollars as we add personnel and incur additional professional fees and insurance costs related to the growth of our business and international expansion. Stock-Based Expenses. Our cost of revenues and operating expenses include stock-based expenses related to option and stock awards to employees and non-employee directors. We recognize our share-based payments as an expense in the statement of operations based on their fair values and vesting periods. These charges are significant and we expect them to increase in absolute dollars in the future. Joint Venture In December 2000, we established a Japanese joint venture, Kabushiki Kaisha salesforce.com, with SunBridge, Inc., a Japanese corporation, to assist us with our sales efforts in Japan. During the prior fiscal year, we increased our ownership interest in the joint venture from 65 percent to 72 percent. Because of this controlling interest, we consolidate the ventures financial results, which are reflected in each revenue, cost of revenues and expense category in our consolidated statement of operations. We then record a noncontrolling interest which reflects the interest that we do not control in the ventures results. Through January 31, 2010, the operating performance and liquidity requirements of the Japanese joint venture have not been significant. While we plan to expand our selling and marketing activities in Japan in order to add new customers, we believe the future operating performance and liquidity requirements of the Japanese joint venture will not be significant. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, costs and expenses, and related disclosures. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates and assumptions. Our actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.  We believe that of our significant accounting policies, which are described in note 1 to our consolidated financial statements, the following accounting policies involve a greater degree of judgment and complexity. Accordingly, these are the policies we believe are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our consolidated financial condition and results of operations. Revenue Recognition . We recognize revenue when all of the following conditions are satisfied: (1) there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement; (2) the service has been provided to the customer; (3) the collection of our fees is reasonably assured; and (4) the amount of fees to be paid by the customer is fixed or determinable. Our arrangements do not contain general rights of return. We recognize subscription revenues ratably over the contract terms beginning on the commencement dates of each contract. Support revenues from customers who purchase our premium support offerings are recognized similarly over the term of the support contract. As part of their subscription agreements, customers generally benefit from new features and functionality with each release at no additional cost. In situations where we have contractually committed to an individual customer specific technology, we defer all of the revenue for that customer until the technology is delivered and accepted. Once delivery occurs, we then recognize the revenue over the remaining contract term. Consulting services and training revenues are accounted for separately from subscription and support revenues when these services have value to the customer on a standalone basis and there is objective and reliable evidence of fair value of each deliverable. When accounted for separately, revenues are recognized as the services are rendered for time and material contracts, and when the milestones are achieved and accepted by the customer for fixed price contracts. The majority of our consulting service contracts are on a time and material basis. Training revenues are recognized after the services are performed. For revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables, such as an arrangement that includes subscription, premium support, consulting or training services, we allocate the total amount the customer will pay to the separate units of accounting based on their relative fair values, as determined by the price of the undelivered items when sold separately. In determining whether the consulting services can be accounted for separately from subscription and support revenues, we consider the following factors for each consulting agreement: availability of the consulting services from other vendors, whether objective and reliable evidence for fair value exists for the undelivered elements, the nature of the consulting services, the timing of when the consulting contract was signed in comparison to the subscription service start date, and the contractual dependence of the subscription service on the customers satisfaction with the consulting work. If a consulting arrangement does not qualify for separate accounting, we recognize the consulting revenue ratably over the remaining term of the subscription contract. Additionally, in these situations we defer the direct costs of the consulting arrangement and amortize those costs over the same time period as the consulting revenue is recognized. The deferred cost on our consolidated balance sheet totaled $19.1 million at January 31, 2010 and $17.3 million at January 31, 2009. Such amounts are included in prepaid expenses and other current assets and other assets. Accounting for Deferred Commissions. We defer commission payments to our direct sales representatives. The commissions are deferred and amortized to sales expense over the non-cancelable terms of the related subscription contracts with our customers, which are typically 12 to 24 months. The commission payments, which are paid in full the month after the customers service commences, are a direct and incremental cost of the revenue arrangements. The deferred commission amounts are recoverable through the future revenue streams under the non-cancelable customer contracts. We believe this is the preferable method of accounting as the commission charges are so closely related to the revenue from the non-cancelable customer contracts that they should be recorded as an asset and charged to expense over the same period that the subscription revenue is recognized.  During fiscal 2010, we deferred $82.3 million of commission expenditures and we amortized $63.9 million to sales expense. During the same period a year ago, we deferred $63.7 million of commission expenditures and we amortized $58.7 million to sales expense. Deferred commissions on our consolidated balance sheet totaled $75.5 million at January 31, 2010 and $57.1 million at January 31, 2009. Accounting for Stock-Based Awards. We recognize the fair value of our stock awards on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period of the award which is the vesting term of approximately four years. We recognized stock-based expense of $88.9 million, or 7 percent of revenue, during fiscal 2010. The requirement to expense stock-based awards will continue to materially reduce our reported results of operations. As of January 31, 2010, we had an aggregate of $283.6 million of stock compensation remaining to be amortized to expense over the remaining requisite service period of the underlying awards. We currently expect this stock compensation balance to be amortized as follows: $115.8 million during fiscal 2011; $89.3 million during fiscal 2012; $52.5 million during fiscal 2013; and $26.0 million during fiscal 2014. These amounts reflect only outstanding stock awards as of January 31, 2010 and assume no forfeiture activity. We expect to continue to issue share-based awards to our employees in future periods. We recognize as an operating expense the payroll and social tax costs when stock options are exercised. The impact of stock-based expense in the future is dependent upon, among other things, the timing of when we hire additional employees, the effect of long-term incentive strategies involving stock awards in order to continue to attract and retain employees, the total number of stock awards granted, the fair value of the stock awards at the time of grant, changes in estimated forfeiture assumption rates and the tax benefit that we may or may not receive from stock-based expenses. Additionally, we are required to use an option-pricing model to determine the fair value of stock option awards. This determination of fair value is affected by our stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of highly complex and subjective variables. These variables include, but are not limited to, our expected stock price volatility over the term of the awards. As of January 31, 2010, there were 2.3 million restricted stock units outstanding. We plan to continue awarding restricted stock units to our employees in the future. The restricted stock units, which upon vesting entitles the holder to one share of common stock for each restricted stock unit, have an exercise price of $0.001 per share, which is equal to the par value of our common stock, and vest over 4 years. The fair value of the restricted stock units is based on our closing stock price on the date of grant, and compensation expense, net of estimated forfeitures, is recognized on a straight-line basis over the vesting period. Accounting for Income Taxes. We account for income taxes using the liability method, which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets or liabilities for the tax-effected temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of our assets and liabilities and for net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. The tax expense or benefit for unusual items, prior year income tax uncertainties, or certain adjustments to the valuation allowance are treated as discrete items in the interim period in which the events occur. Our effective tax rate could be adversely affected by changes in the mix of earnings and losses in countries with differing statutory tax rates, certain non-deductible expenses arising from stock-based awards and the changes in tax laws and accounting principles.

Subscription and support revenues were $1.2 billion, or 93 percent of total revenues, for fiscal 2010, compared to $1.0 billion, or 91 percent of total revenues, during the same period a year ago. Professional services and other revenues were $96.1 million, or 7 percent of total revenues, for fiscal 2010, compared to $92.2 million, or 9 percent of total revenues, for the same period a year ago. The increase in professional services and other revenues was due primarily to the higher demand for services from an increased number of paying subscribers and customers. Revenues in Europe and Asia Pacific accounted for $381.8 million, or 29 percent of total revenues, for fiscal 2010, compared to $300.3 million, or 28 percent of total revenues, during the same period a year ago, an increase of $81.5 million, or 27 percent. The increase in revenues outside of the Americas was the result of our efforts to expand internationally. As part of our overall growth, we expect the percentage of our revenue generated in Europe and Asia Pacific to continue to increase as a percentage of our total revenues world wide. Cost of Revenues. ##TABLE_START   Fiscal Year Ended January 31,   Variance Dollars (In thousands)  2010   2009   Subscription and support  $ 159,172   $ 127,082   $ 32,090 Professional services and other   98,753    93,389    5,364            Total cost of revenues  $ 257,925   $ 220,471   $ 37,454            Percent of total revenues   20 %   20 %  ##TABLE_END Cost of revenues was $257.9 million, or 20 percent of total revenues, during fiscal 2010, compared to $220.5 million, or 20 percent of total revenues, during the same period a year ago, an increase of $37.4 million. The increase in absolute dollars was primarily due to an increase of $8.4 million in employee-related costs, an increase of $1.5 million in stock-based expenses, an increase of $7.2 million in service delivery costs, primarily due to our efforts in increasing data center capacity, an increase of $9.8 million in depreciation and amortization expenses, an increase of $6.7 million in outside subcontractor and other service costs and an increase of $1.6  million in allocated overhead. The cost of the professional services headcount resulted in the cost of professional services and other revenues to be in excess of the related revenue during fiscal 2010 by $2.6 million as compared to $1.2 million during fiscal 2009. As described above, we intend to continue to invest additional resources in our enterprise cloud computing application service. The timing of these additional expenses, will affect our cost of revenues, both in terms of absolute dollars and as a percentage of revenues. We expect the cost of professional services and other revenue to continue to be in excess of the related revenue during fiscal 2011. We plan to make this investment since our professional services are designed to facilitate the adoption of our application service. Additionally, as more professional service arrangements are accounted for as a single unit of accounting with the related subscription service and recognized ratably over the term of the subscription contract, our costs of professional services will exceed the related revenue recognized. Research and Development. ##TABLE_START   Fiscal Year Ended January 31,   Variance Dollars (In thousands)  2010   2009   Research and development  $ 131,897   $ 99,530   $ 32,367 Percent of total revenues   10 %   9 %  ##TABLE_END Research and development expenses were $131.9 million, or 10 percent of total revenues, during fiscal 2010, compared to $99.5 million, or 9 percent of total revenues, during the same period a year ago, an increase of $32.4 million. The increase in absolute dollars was due to an increase of $25.2 million in employee-related costs, an increase of $3.3 million in stock-based expenses, and an increase of $3.5 million in allocated overhead. We increased our research and development headcount by 24 percent since January 31, 2009 in order to upgrade and extend our service offerings and develop new technologies. Marketing and Sales . ##TABLE_START   Fiscal Year Ended January 31,   Variance Dollars (In thousands)  2010   2009   Marketing and sales  $ 605,199   $ 534,413   $ 70,786 Percent of total revenues   46 %   50 %  ##TABLE_END Marketing and sales expenses were $605.2 million, or 46 percent of total revenues, during fiscal 2010, compared to $534.4 million, or 50 percent of total revenues, during the same period a year ago, an increase of $70.8 million. The increase in absolute dollars was primarily due to increases of $42.0 million in employee-related costs, $3.7 million in stock-based expenses, $17.1 million in advertising costs and marketing and event costs and $6.7 million in allocated overhead. Our marketing and sales headcount increased by 9 percent since January 31, 2009 as we hired additional sales personnel to focus on adding new customers and increasing penetration within our existing customer base. General and Administrative. ##TABLE_START   Fiscal Year Ended January 31,   Variance Dollars (In thousands)  2010   2009   General and administrative  $ 195,290   $ 158,613   $ 36,677 Percent of total revenues   15 %   15 %  ##TABLE_END  General and administrative expenses were $195.3 million, or 15 percent of total revenues, during fiscal 2010, compared to $158.6 million, or 15 percent of total revenues, during the same period a year ago, an increase of $36.7 million. The increase was primarily due to increases of $15.7 million in employee-related costs, $3.0 million in stock-based expenses, $4.7 million in infrastructure-related costs, and $10.1 million in professional and outside service costs. Our general and administrative headcount increased by 12 percent since January 31, 2009 as we added personnel to support our growth. Income from operations. ##TABLE_START   Fiscal Year Ended January 31,   Variance Dollars (In thousands)  2010   2009   Income from operations  $ 115,272   $ 63,742   $ 51,530 Percent of total revenues   9 %   6 %  ##TABLE_END Operating income during fiscal 2010 was $115.3 million and included $88.9 million of stock-based expenses.

Investment income. ##TABLE_START   Fiscal Year Ended January 31,   Variance Dollars (In thousands)  2010   2009   Investment income  $ 30,408   $ 22,774   $ 7,634 Percent of total revenues   2 %   2 %  ##TABLE_END Investment income consists of income on cash and marketable securities balances. Investment income was $30.4 million during fiscal 2010 and was $22.8 million during the same period a year ago. The increase was primarily due to increased realized gains and the increase in marketable securities balances resulting from cash generated by operating activities and the proceeds from stock option exercises. Interest expense. ##TABLE_START   Fiscal Year Ended January 31,   Variance Dollars  (In thousands)  2010   2009   Interest expense  $ (2,000 )  $ (107 )  $ (1,893 ) ##TABLE_END Interest expense consists primarily of interest on our capital leases. Interest expense was $2.0 million during fiscal 2010 and was $0.1 million during the same period a year ago. The increase was primarily due to capital leases associated with equipment in expanding our data center capacity. We expect interest expense to be significantly higher in fiscal 2011 because of the interest expense associated with the January 2010 issuance of $575.0 million of convertible senior notes. Other income (expense). ##TABLE_START   Fiscal Year Ended January 31,   Variance Dollars  (In thousands)  2010   2009   Other income (expense)  $ (1,299 )  $ (817 )  $ (482 ) ##TABLE_END Other income (expense) primarily consists of foreign currency transaction gains and losses. Other income (expense) increased due to realized and unrealized gains on foreign currency transactions for fiscal 2010 compared to the same period a year ago.  Provision for Income Taxes. ##TABLE_START    Fiscal Year Ended January 31,  (In thousands)  2010   2009   Dollars  Provision for income taxes  $ (57,689 )  $ (37,557 )  $ (20,132 ) Effective tax rate   41 %   44 %  ##TABLE_END The provision for income taxes was $57.7 million during fiscal 2010, compared to $37.6 million during the same period a year ago. Our effective tax rate decreased to 41 percent for fiscal 2010 compared to 44 percent for the same period a year ago. The decrease was due to a higher proportion of income in countries with lower income tax rates than the U.S. statutory tax rate as well as increased tax credits. The total income tax benefit recognized in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations related to stock-based compensation was $32.1 million for the current fiscal year. See Note 7 Income Taxes to the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for our reconciliation of income taxes at the statutory federal rate to the provision for income taxes. In addition, in February 2009, the State of California enacted several income tax law changes which include an election to apply a single sales factor apportionment formula and adoption of a market sourcing approach for service income that will impact us beginning in fiscal 2012. As a result, we re-valued the anticipated future tax effects of our California temporary differences including stock-based compensation and purchased intangibles. Accordingly, we recorded an income tax expense of $2.7 million during the fiscal 2010 related to this tax law change. Fiscal Years Ended January 31, 2009 and 2008 Revenues. ##TABLE_START (In thousands)  Fiscal Year Ended January 31,  Variance   2009  2008  Dollars  Percent  Subscription and support  $ 984,574  $ 680,581  $ 303,993  45 % Professional services and other   92,195   68,119   24,076  35 %             Total revenues  $ 1,076,769  $ 748,700  $ 328,069  44 %             ##TABLE_END Total revenues were $1.1 billion for fiscal 2009, compared to $748.7 million for fiscal 2008, an increase of $328.1 million, or 44 percent. Subscription and support revenues were $984.6 million, or 91 percent of total revenues, for fiscal 2009, compared to $680.6 million, or 91 percent of total revenues, during fiscal 2008. Professional services and other revenues were $92.2 million, or 9 percent of total revenues, for fiscal 2009, compared to $68.1 million, or 9 percent of total revenues, for fiscal 2008. The increase in professional services and other revenues was due primarily to the higher demand for services from an increased number of paying subscriptions and customers. Revenues in Europe and Asia Pacific accounted for $300.3 million, or 28 percent of total revenues, for fiscal 2009, compared to $190.7 million, or 25 percent of total revenues, during fiscal 2008, an increase of $109.6 million, or 57 percent. The increase in revenues outside of the Americas was the result of our efforts to expand internationally. Additionally, the value of the U.S. dollar relative to foreign currencies contributed to the increase in total revenues for the year ended January 31, 2009 as compared to fiscal 2008. The foreign currency impact compared to fiscal 2008 was an increase of $16.6 million.

The increase in absolute dollars was primarily due to an increase of $13.8 million in employee-related costs, an increase of $3.1 million in stock-based expenses, an increase of $9.9 million in service delivery costs, primarily due to our efforts in increasing data center capacity, an increase of $7.2 million in depreciation and amortization expenses, an increase of $10.7 million in outside subcontractor and other service costs and an increase of $3.3 million in allocated overhead. The cost of the additional professional services headcount resulted in the cost of professional services and other revenues to be in excess of the related revenue during fiscal 2009 by $1.2 million as compared to $12.2 million during fiscal 2008. This reduction was the result of increasing the utilization of existing professional services staff, utilizing more outside subcontractors and not significantly increasing professional services headcount.

The increase in absolute dollars was primarily due to increases of $94.1 million in employee-related costs, $10.6 million in stock-based expenses, $28.9 million in advertising costs and marketing and event costs, $1.6 million in partner referral fees, $1.4 million of amortized purchased intangibles and $20.3 million in allocated overhead.

Investment income was $22.8 million during fiscal 2009 and was $24.5 million during fiscal 2008. The decrease was primarily due to a $2.0 million loss for our investment in marketable securities. Due to the current decline in market interest rates since fiscal 2008 and our focus on capital preservation, investment income declined when compared to the same periods in the previous year.

The total income tax benefit recognized in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations related to stock-based expenses was $26.3 million for fiscal 2009. Liquidity and Capital Resources At January 31, 2010, our principal sources of liquidity were cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaling $1.7 billion and accounts receivable of $321.0 million. Net cash provided by operating activities was $270.9 million during fiscal 2010 and $229.6 million during the same period a year ago. The improvement in cash flow was due primarily to the growth in our customer base and the associated increase in billings and collections. Cash provided by operating activities has historically been affected by the amount of net income, sales of subscriptions and support and professional services, changes in working capital accounts, particularly increases and seasonality in accounts receivable and deferred revenue as described above, and the timing of commission and bonus payments, collections from large enterprise customers, and add-backs of non-cash expense items such as depreciation and amortization and the expense associated with stock-based awards. Net cash used in investing activities was $378.6 million during fiscal 2010 and $121.0 million during the same period a year ago. The net cash used in investing activities during fiscal 2010 primarily related to the investment of cash balances and capital expenditures associated with leasehold improvements, and the purchase of software licenses, computer equipment and furniture and fixtures as we have expanded our infrastructure, number of offices around the world and work force. Additionally, during the year we purchased two privately held companies for approximately $12.0 million and invested approximately $4.4 million in other privately-held companies. Net cash provided by financing activities was $637.2 million during fiscal 2010 and $96.9 million during the same period a year ago. Net cash provided by financing activities during fiscal 2010 substantially consisted of the net proceeds of $499.9 million related to our issuance of convertible notes and associated hedge transactions described below. In addition we had $93.9 million of proceeds from the exercise of employee stock options and $51.5 million of excess tax benefits from employee stock plans.  In January 2010, we issued $575.0 million of 0.75% convertible senior notes due January 15, 2015 (the Notes) and concurrently entered into convertible notes hedges (the Note Hedges) and separate warrant transactions (the Warrants). The Notes will mature on January 15, 2015, unless earlier converted. As of January 31, 2010, the Notes have not been repurchased or converted. We also have not received any shares under the Note Hedges or delivered cash or shares under the Warrants. For further information, see Note 2 to the notes to consolidated financial statements. Our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities are comprised primarily of corporate notes and obligations, U.S. treasury securities, U.S. agency obligations, time deposits, money market mutual funds. As of January 31, 2010, we have a total of $10.6 million in letters of credit outstanding in favor of our landlords for office space in San Francisco, California, New York City, Singapore, Sweden and Switzerland. To date, no amounts have been drawn against the letters of credit, which renew annually and mature at various dates through October 2018. We do not have any special purpose entities, and other than operating leases for office space and computer equipment, we do not engage in off-balance sheet financing arrangements. Additionally, we currently do not have a bank line of credit. Our principal commitments consist of obligations under leases for office space and co-location facilities for additional data center capacity and the development and test data center, and computer equipment and furniture and fixtures. We also have long-term liabilities related to the issuance of the Notes. The stated interest rate is 0.75%. At January 31, 2010, the future non-cancelable minimum payments under these commitments were as follows: ##TABLE_START (In thousands) Contractual Obligations  Payments Due by Period  Total  Less than 1 Year  1-3 Years  3-5 Years  More than 5 Years   (in thousands) Capital lease obligations  $ 15,583  $ 7,249  $ 8,334  $   $  Operating lease obligations:      Facilities space   229,201   49,930   83,405   45,180   50,686 Computer equipment and furniture and fixtures   51,008   32,011   18,997       Convertible Senior Notes, including interest   596,515   4,265   8,625   583,625    Contractual commitments   14,553   13,388   1,165       ##TABLE_END Our lease agreements provide us with the option to renew. Our future operating lease obligations would change if we exercised these options and if we entered into additional operating lease agreements as we expand our operations. Purchase orders are not included in the table above. Our purchase orders represent authorizations to purchase rather than binding agreements. The contractual commitment amounts in the table above are associated with agreements that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms, including: fixed or minimum services to be used; fixed, minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. Obligations under contracts that we can cancel without a significant penalty are not included in the table above. The timing of tax settlements are not included in the table above. We are unable to make a reasonable estimate of the timing of payments in individual years beyond 12 months due to uncertainties in the timing of tax settlements. For further information, see Note 7 to the notes to consolidated financial statements. We recorded liabilities related to uncertain tax positions.  We believe our existing cash, cash equivalents and short-term marketable securities and cash provided by operating activities will be sufficient to meet our working capital and capital expenditure needs over the next 12 months. During fiscal 2011, we may enter into arrangements to acquire or invest in complementary businesses or joint ventures, services or technologies. While we believe we have sufficient financial resources, we may be required to seek additional equity or debt financing. Additional funds may not be available on terms favorable to us or at all. Recent Accounting Pronouncements In September 2009, the Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, issued Update No. 2009-13,  Revenue Recognition (Topic 605) , Multiple-Deliverable Revenue Arrangementsa consensus of the FASB Emerging Issues Task Force (ASU 2009-13). It updates the existing multiple-element revenue arrangements guidance currently included under ASC 605-25. The revised guidance primarily provides two significant changes: 1) eliminates the need for objective and reliable evidence of the fair value for the undelivered element in order for a delivered item to be treated as a separate unit of accounting, and 2) requires the use of the relative selling price method to allocate the entire arrangement consideration. In addition, the guidance also expands the disclosure requirements for revenue recognition. ASU 2009-13 will be effective for the first annual reporting period beginning on or after June 15, 2010, with early adoption permitted provided that the revised guidance is retroactively applied to the beginning of the year of adoption. We are currently assessing the future impact of this new accounting pronouncement to our consolidated financial statements. ##TABLE_START ", "7A": " ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK ##TABLE_END Foreign currency exchange risk Our results of operations and cash flows are subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates, particularly changes in the Euro, British Pound Sterling, Canadian dollar, Japanese Yen and Australian dollar. We seek to minimize the impact of certain foreign currency fluctuations by hedging certain balance sheet exposures with foreign currency forward contracts. Any gain or loss from settling these contracts is offset by the loss or gain derived from the underlying balance sheet exposures. The hedging contracts by policy have maturities of less than three months. Additionally, by policy, we do not enter into any hedging contracts for trading or speculative purposes. Interest rate sensitivity We had cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaling $1.7 billion at January 31, 2010. This amount was invested primarily in money market funds, time deposits, corporate notes and bonds, government securities and other debt securities with credit ratings of at least single A or better. The cash, cash equivalents and short-term marketable securities are held for working capital purposes. Our investments are made for capital preservation purposes. We do not enter into investments for trading or speculative purposes. Our cash equivalents and our portfolio of marketable securities are subject to market risk due to changes in interest rates. Fixed rate interest securities may have their market value adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates, while floating rate securities may produce less income than expected if interest rates fall. Due in part to these factors, our future investment income may fall short of expectation due to changes in interest rates or we may suffer losses in principal if we are forced to sell securities that decline in the market value due to changes in interest rates. However because we classify our debt securities as available for sale, no gains or losses are recognized due to changes in interest rates unless such securities are sold prior to maturity or declines in fair value are determined to be other-than-temporary. Our fixed-income portfolio is subject to interest rate risk. An immediate increase or decrease in interest rates of 100-basis points at January 31, 2010 could result in a $13.1 million market value reduction or increase of the same amount. This estimate is based on a sensitivity  model that measures market value changes when changes in interest rates occur. Fluctuations in the value of our investment securities caused by a change in interest rates (gains or losses on the carrying value) are recorded in other comprehensive income, and are realized only if we sell the underlying securities. At January 31, 2009, we had cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaling $882.6 million. The fixed-income portfolio was also subject to interest rate risk. Changes in interest rates of 100-basis points would have resulted in market value changes of $2.3 million. Market Risk and Market Interest Risk In January 2010, we issued at par value $575.0 million of 0.75% convertible senior notes due 2015 (the Notes). Holders may convert their Notes prior to maturity upon the occurrence of certain circumstances. Upon conversion, we would pay the holder an amount of cash equal to the principal amount of the Notes. Amounts in excess of the principal amount, if any, may be paid in cash or stock at our option. Concurrent with the issuance of the Notes, we entered into separate note hedges transactions and the sale of warrants. These separate transactions were completed to reduce the potential economic dilution from the conversion of the Notes. Our Notes have fixed annual interest rates at 0.75% and therefore, we do not have economic interest rate exposure on our Notes. However, the value of the Notes are exposed to interest rate risk. Generally, the fair market value of our fixed interest rate Notes will increase as interest rates fall and decrease as interest rates rise. In addition, the fair value of our Notes is affected by our stock price. The carrying value of our Notes was $450.2 million as of January 31, 2010. This represents the liability component of the $575.0 million principal balance as of January 31, 2010. The total estimated fair value of our Notes at January 31, 2010 was $545.2 million and the fair value was determined based on the closing trading price per $100 of our Notes as of the last day of trading for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010, which was $94.82.

Our audits also included the financial statement schedule listed in the Index at Item 15(a)2. These financial statements and schedule are the responsibility of the Companys management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and schedule based on our audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements and schedule are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of salesforce.com, inc. at January 31, 2010 and 2009, and the consolidated results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended January 31, 2010, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), salesforce.com, inc.s internal control over financial reporting as of January 31, 2010, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated March 11, 2010 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon. / S / E RNST  Y OUNG LLP San Jose, California March 11, 2010  REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM The Board of Directors and Stockholders of salesforce.com, inc. We have audited salesforce.com, inc.s internal control over financial reporting as of January 31, 2010, based on criteria established in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (the COSO criteria). salesforce.com inc.s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Managements Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Companys internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. A companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the Company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. In our opinion, salesforce.com, inc. maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of January 31, 2010, based on the COSO criteria. We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated balance sheets of salesforce.com, inc. as of January 31, 2010 and 2009, and the related consolidated statements of operations, stockholders equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended January 31, 2010 and our report dated March 11, 2010 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon. / S / E RNST  Y OUNG LLP San Jose, California March 11, 2010  salesforce.com, inc.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements 1. Summary of Business and Significant Accounting Policies Description of Business salesforce.com, inc. (the Company) is a leading provider of enterprise cloud computing applications. The Company provides a comprehensive customer and collaboration relationship management (CRM) service to businesses of all sizes and industries worldwide and provides a technology platform for customers and developers to build and run applications. The Company offers its services on a subscription basis. Fiscal Year The Companys fiscal year ends on January 31. References to fiscal 2010, for example, refer to the fiscal year ending January 31, 2010. Use of Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions in the Companys consolidated financial statements and notes thereto. Significant estimates and assumptions made by management include the determination of the provision for income taxes, whether an other-than-temporary decline has occurred in the fair value of certain investments in marketable securities, the fair value of stock awards issued, the non-convertible borrowing rate used to calculate the fair value of the liability component of the convertible senior notes and the allocation of the purchase price paid for acquisitions. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Principles of Consolidation The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly and majority owned subsidiaries. All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. The Company holds a controlling interest in Kabushiki Kaisha salesforce.com (Salesforce Japan), a Japanese joint venture. As of January 31, 2010, the Company owned a 72 percent interest in the joint venture. Given the Companys controlling interest in the joint venture, the accounts of the joint venture have been consolidated with the accounts of the Company, and a noncontrolling interest has been recorded for the noncontrolling investors interests in the net assets and operations of the joint venture to the extent of the noncontrolling investors individual investments. Noncontrolling interest of $12.9 million and $10.7 million as of January 31, 2010 and January 31, 2009, respectively, have been reflected in stockholders equity. The Company now reports the noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary as a component of equity in the consolidated balance sheets and discloses on the face of the consolidated statements of operations the amounts of the consolidated net income attributable to the parent and to the noncontrolling interests. Prior period amounts have been reclassified to reflect the effect of the retrospective adoption in fiscal 2010 of new accounting and presentation guidance for noncontrolling interest, the effect of which is not material to any period presented. Segments The Company operates in one segment.  salesforce.com, inc. Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements(Continued)  Foreign Currency Translation The functional currency of the Companys major foreign subsidiaries is generally the local currency. Adjustments resulting from translating foreign functional currency financial statements into U.S. dollars are recorded as part of a separate component of stockholders equity. Foreign currency transaction gains and losses are included in net income for the period. All assets and liabilities denominated in a foreign currency are translated into U.S. dollars at the exchange rate on the balance sheet date. Revenues and expenses are translated at the average exchange rate during the period. Equity transactions are translated using historical exchange rates. Concentrations of Credit Risk and Significant Customers and Suppliers The Companys financial instruments that are exposed to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities and trade accounts receivable. Although the Company deposits its cash with multiple financial institutions, its deposits, at times, may exceed federally insured limits. Collateral is not required for accounts receivable. The Company maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts receivable balances. The allowance is based upon historical loss patterns, the number of days that billings are past due and an evaluation of the potential risk of loss associated with delinquent accounts. No customer accounted for more than 5 percent of accounts receivable at January 31, 2010 and 2009. No single customer accounted for 5 percent or more of total revenue during fiscal 2010, 2009 and 2008. As of January 31, 2010 and 2009, assets located outside the Americas were 12 percent and 14 percent of total assets, respectively. Revenues by geographical region are as follows (in thousands): ##TABLE_START   Fiscal Year Ended January 31,   2010  2009  2008 Revenues by geography:    Americas  $ 923,823  $ 776,495  $ 557,976 Europe   232,367   190,685   127,010 Asia Pacific   149,393   109,589   63,714           $ 1,305,583  $ 1,076,769  $ 748,700          ##TABLE_END Cash and Cash Equivalents The Company considers all highly liquid investments purchased with an original maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents. Cash and cash equivalents, are stated at cost, which approximates fair value. Marketable Securities Management determines the appropriate classification of investments in marketable securities at the time of purchase and reevaluates such determination at each balance sheet date. Securities are classified as available for sale and are carried at fair value, with the unrealized gains and losses, net of tax, reported as a separate component of stockholders equity. Fair value is determined based on quoted market rates when observable or utilizing data points that are observable, such as quoted prices, interest rates and yield curves. Declines in fair value judged to be other-than-temporary on securities available for sale are included as a component of investment income. The cost of securities sold is based on the specific-identification method. Interest on securities classified as available for sale is also included as a component of investment income. In order to determine whether a decline in value is other-than-temporary, we evaluate, among other factors: the duration and extent to which the fair value has been less than the carrying value, our financial condition and business outlook,  salesforce.com, inc. Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements(Continued)  including key operational and cash flow metrics, current market conditions and our intent and ability to retain the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in fair market value. Fair Value of Financial Instruments The Company reports its financial and non-financial assets and liabilities that are re-measured and reported at fair value at each reporting period. The Company measures its cash equivalents, marketable securities and foreign currency derivative contracts at fair value. A majority of the Companys cash equivalents and its marketable securities are classified within Level 1 or Level 2, which are described below. This is because the Companys cash equivalents and marketable securities are valued using quoted market prices or alternative pricing sources and models utilizing market observable inputs. The Companys foreign currency derivative contracts are classified within Level 2 as the valuation inputs are based on quoted prices and market observable data of similar instruments in inactive markets. The Company established a three-tier value hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used in the valuation methodologies in measuring fair value: ##TABLE_START Level 1.

The Company uses forward currency derivative contracts to minimize the Companys exposure of balances denominated in Euros, Swiss francs, Australian dollars, Singapore dollars, Japanese yen and British pounds. The Companys program is not designated for trading or speculative purposes. As of January 31, 2010 the foreign currency derivative contracts that were not settled are recorded at fair value on the consolidated balance sheet. The Companys foreign currency derivative contracts which are not designated as hedging instruments are used to reduce the exchange rate risk associated primarily with intercompany receivables and payables. Foreign currency derivative contracts are marked-to-market at the end of each reporting period with gains and losses recognized as other income (expense) to offset the gains or losses resulting from the settlement or remeasurement of the underlying foreign currency denominated receivables and payables. While the contract or notional amount is often used to express the volume of foreign currency derivative contracts, the amounts potentially subject to credit risk are generally limited to the amounts, if any, by which the counterparties obligations under the agreements exceed the obligations of the Company to the counterparties.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements(Continued)  When assets are retired, the cost and accumulated depreciation and amortization are removed from their respective accounts and any loss on such retirement is reflected in operating expenses. When assets are otherwise disposed of, the cost and related accumulated depreciation and amortization are removed from their respective accounts and any gain or loss on such sale or disposal is reflected in other income. Impairment of Long-Lived Assets The Company evaluates the recoverability of its long-lived assets for possible impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable. If such review indicates that the carrying amount of long-lived assets is not recoverable, the carrying amount of such assets is reduced to fair value. There was no impairment of long-lived assets during fiscal 2010, 2009 and 2008. The Company evaluates and tests the recoverability of the goodwill for impairment annually in the fourth quarter or more often if and when circumstances indicate that goodwill may not be recoverable. There was no impairment of goodwill during fiscal 2010 and 2009 and 2008. Capitalized Software Costs For its website development costs and the development costs related to its enterprise cloud computing application service, the company capitalizes costs incurred during the application development stage. Costs related to preliminary project activities and post implementation activities were expensed as incurred. Internal use software is amortized on a straight line basis over its estimated useful life, generally three years. Management evaluates the useful lives of these assets on an annual basis and tests for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances occur that could impact the recoverability of these assets. The Company capitalized $15.1, million $10.2 million and $11.1 million of costs during fiscal 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. Amortization expense totaled $9.9 million, $6.6 million, and $2.7 million during fiscal 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. Comprehensive Income Comprehensive income consists of net income and accumulated other comprehensive income, which includes certain changes in equity that are excluded from net income. Specifically, cumulative foreign currency translation adjustments and unrealized gains and losses on marketable securities, net of taxes of $3.9 million in fiscal 2010 and $0.6 million in fiscal 2009, are included in accumulated other comprehensive income. Accumulated other comprehensive loss has been reflected in stockholders equity.

Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on temporary differences between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities and net operating loss and credit carryforwards using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. Valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amounts more likely than not expected to be realized. The total income tax benefit recognized in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations related to stock-based awards was $32.1 million, $26.3 million and $18.5 million for fiscal years 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. The Company recognizes interest accrued and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in its tax provision. As of January 31, 2010, the Company accrued no penalties and immaterial amount of interest in income tax expense.  salesforce.com, inc. Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements(Continued)  Revenue Recognition The Company derives its revenues from two sources: (1) subscription revenues, which are comprised of subscription fees from customers accessing its enterprise cloud computing application service, and from customers purchasing additional support beyond the standard support that is included in the basic subscription fee; and (2) related professional services and other revenue. Other revenues consist primarily of training fees. The Company recognizes revenue when all of the following conditions are met: ##TABLE_START    There is persuasive evidence of an arrangement; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    The service has been provided to the customer; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    The collection of the fees is reasonably assured; and ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    The amount of fees to be paid by the customer is fixed or determinable. ##TABLE_END The Companys arrangements do not contain general rights of return. Subscription and support revenues are recognized ratably over the contract terms beginning on the commencement date of each contract. Amounts that have been invoiced are recorded in accounts receivable and in deferred revenue or revenue, depending on whether the revenue recognition criteria have been met. Professional services and other revenues, when sold with subscription and support offerings, are accounted for separately when these services have value to the customer on a standalone basis and there is objective and reliable evidence of fair value of each deliverable. When accounted for separately, revenues are recognized as the services are rendered for time and material contracts, and when the milestones are achieved and accepted by the customer for fixed price contracts. The majority of the Companys consulting contracts are on a time and materials basis. Training revenues are recognized after the services are performed. For revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables, such as an arrangement that includes subscription, premium support and consulting or training services, the Company allocates the total amount the customer will pay to the separate units of accounting based on their relative fair values, as determined by the price of the undelivered items when sold separately. In determining whether the consulting services can be accounted for separately from subscription and support revenues, the Company considers the following factors for each consulting agreement: availability of the consulting services from other vendors, whether objective and reliable evidence for fair value exists for the undelivered elements, the nature of the consulting services, the timing of when the consulting contract was signed in comparison to the subscription service start date, and the contractual dependence of the subscription service on the customers satisfaction with the consulting work. If a consulting arrangement does not qualify for separate accounting, the Company recognizes the consulting revenue ratably over the remaining term of the subscription contract. Additionally, in these situations, the Company defers only the direct costs of the consulting arrangement and amortizes those costs over the same time period as the consulting revenue is recognized. As of January 31, 2010 and January 31, 2009, the deferred cost on the accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheet totaled $19.1 million and $17.3 million, respectively. These deferred costs are included in prepaid expenses and other current assets and other assets. Deferred Revenue Deferred revenue primarily consists of billings or payments received in advance of revenue recognition from the Companys subscription service described above and is recognized as the revenue recognition criteria are met. The Company generally invoices its customers in annual or quarterly installments. Accordingly, the deferred revenue balance does not represent the total contract value of annual or multi-year, non-cancelable subscription  salesforce.com, inc. Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements(Continued)  agreements. Deferred revenue also includes certain deferred professional services fees which are recognized as revenue ratably over the subscription contract term. The Company defers the professional service fees in situations where the professional services and subscription contracts are accounted for as a single unit of accounting. Deferred revenue that will be recognized during the succeeding 12-month period is recorded as current deferred revenue and the remaining portion is recorded as noncurrent. Approximately 6 percent and 7 percent of total deferred revenue as of January 31, 2010 and January 31, 2009, respectively related to deferred professional services revenue. Deferred Commissions Deferred commissions are the incremental costs that are directly associated with non-cancelable subscription contracts with customers and consist of sales commissions paid to the Companys direct sales representatives. The commissions are deferred and amortized over the non-cancelable terms of the related customer contracts, which are typically 12 to 24 months. The commission payments are paid in full the month after the customers service commences. The deferred commission amounts are recoverable through the future revenue streams under the non-cancelable customer contracts. The Company believes this is the preferable method of accounting as the commission charges are so closely related to the revenue from the non-cancelable customer contracts that they should be recorded as an asset and charged to expense over the same period that the subscription revenue is recognized. Amortization of deferred commissions is included in marketing and sales expense in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations. Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation The Company recognizes share-based expenses on a straight-line over the requisite service period of the awards, which is the vesting term of four years. Share-based expenses are recognized net of estimated forfeiture activity. The fair value of each option grant was estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model with the following assumptions and fair value per share: ##TABLE_START   2010  2009  2008 Volatility  50 - 60%  47 - 60%  46 - 47% Weighted-average estimated life  3.8 - 4 years  4 years  4 years Weighted-average risk-free interest rate  1.78 - 2.39%  1.47 - 3.08%  3.32 - 4.55% Dividend yield       Weighted-average fair value per share of grants  $24.73  $15.39  $20.49 ##TABLE_END Since November 2009, the weighted-average estimated life was based on an actual analysis of expected life. Prior to November 2009, the weighted-average estimated life assumption of 4 years was based on the average of the vesting term and the 5 year contractual lives of options awarded. The weighted average risk free interest rate is based on the rate for a 4 year U.S. government security at the time of the option grant. The Company estimated its future stock price volatility considering both its observed option-implied volatilities and its historical volatility calculations. Management believes this is the best estimate of the expected volatility over the 4 year weighted-average expected life of its option grants. During fiscal 2010 and 2009, the Company capitalized $2.4 million and $1.9 million, respectively, of stock based expenses related to capitalized internal-use software development and deferred professional services costs. During fiscal 2010, the Company recognized stock-based expense of $88.9 million. As of January 31, 2010, the aggregate stock compensation remaining to be amortized to costs and expenses was $283.6 million. The  salesforce.com, inc. Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements(Continued)  Company expects this stock compensation balance to be amortized as follows: $115.8 million during fiscal 2011; $89.3 million during fiscal 2012; $52.5 million during fiscal 2013 and $26.0 million during fiscal 2014. The expected amortization reflects only outstanding stock awards as of January 31, 2010 and assumes no forfeiture activity. The Company expects to continue to issue share-based awards to its employees in future periods. Warranties and Indemnification The Companys enterprise cloud computing application service is typically warranted to perform in a manner consistent with general industry standards that are reasonably applicable and materially in accordance with the Companys online help documentation under normal use and circumstances. The Companys arrangements generally include certain provisions for indemnifying customers against liabilities if its products or services infringe a third-partys intellectual property rights. To date, the Company has not incurred any material costs as a result of such indemnifications and has not accrued any liabilities related to such obligations in the accompanying consolidated financial statements. The Company has also agreed to indemnify its directors and executive officers for costs associated with any fees, expenses, judgments, fines and settlement amounts incurred by any of these persons in any action or proceeding to which any of those persons is, or is threatened to be, made a party by reason of the persons service as a director or officer, including any action by the Company, arising out of that persons services as the Companys director or officer or that persons services provided to any other company or enterprise at the Companys request. The Company maintains director and officer insurance coverage that would generally enable the Company to recover a portion of any future amounts paid. The Company may also be subject to indemnification obligation by law with respect to the actions of its employees under certain circumstances and in certain jurisdictions. Advertising Expenses Advertising is expensed as incurred. Advertising expense was $50.8 million, $43.7 million and $25.6 million for fiscal 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. Subsequent Events The Company evaluated subsequent events through the date this Annual Report on Form 10-K was filed with the SEC. New Accounting Pronouncements In September 2009, the FASB issued Update No. 2009-13, Multiple-Deliverable Revenue Arrangementsa consensus of the FASB Emerging Issues Task Force (ASU 2009-13). It updates the existing multiple-element revenue arrangements guidance currently included under ASC 605-25, which originated primarily from the guidance in EITF Issue No. 00-21, Revenue Arrangements with Multiple Deliverables (EITF 00-21). The revised guidance primarily provides two significant changes: 1) eliminates the need for objective and reliable evidence of the fair value for the undelivered element in order for a delivered item to be treated as a separate unit of accounting, and 2) eliminates the residual method to allocate the arrangement consideration. In addition, the guidance also expands the disclosure requirements for revenue recognition. ASU 2009-13 will be effective for the first annual reporting period beginning on or after June 15, 2010, with early adoption permitted provided that the revised guidance is retroactively applied to the beginning of the year of adoption. The Company is currently assessing the future impact of this new accounting pronouncement to its consolidated financial statements.  salesforce.com, inc.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements(Continued)  0.75% Convertible Senior Notes In January 2010, the Company issued at par value $575.0 million of 0.75% convertible senior notes due January 15, 2015 (the Notes). Interest is payable semi-annually in arrears on January 15 and July 15 of each year, commencing July 15, 2010. The Notes are governed by an Indenture dated as of January 19, 2010, between the Company, as issuer, and U.S. Bank National Association, as trustee. The Notes do not contain any financial covenants or any restrictions on the payment of dividends, the incurrence of senior debt or other indebtedness, or the issuance or repurchase of securities by the Company. The Notes are unsecured and rank senior in right of payment to the Companys future indebtedness that is expressly subordinated in right of payment to the Notes and rank equal in right of payment to the Companys existing and future unsecured indebtedness that is not so subordinated and are effectively subordinated in right of payment to any of the Companys cash equal to the principal amount of the Notes, and secured indebtedness to the extent of the value of the assets securing such indebtedness and are structurally subordinated to all existing and future indebtedness and liabilities incurred by our subsidiaries, including trade payables. If converted, holders will receive cash equal to the principal amount of the Notes, and at the Companys election, cash and/or shares of the Companys common stock for any amounts in excess of the principal amounts. The initial conversion rate is 11.7147 shares of common stock per $1,000 principal amount of Notes, subject to anti-dilution adjustments. The initial conversion price is approximately $85.36 per share of common stock. Throughout the term of the Notes, the conversion rate may be adjusted upon the occurrence of certain events, including for any cash dividends. Holders of the Notes will not receive any cash payment representing accrued and unpaid interest upon conversion of a Note. Accrued but unpaid interest will be deemed to be paid in full upon conversion rather than cancelled, extinguished or forfeited. Holders may convert their Notes under the following circumstances: ##TABLE_START    during any fiscal quarter commencing after April 30, 2010, if, for at least 20 trading days during the 30 consecutive trading day period ending on the last trading day of the immediately preceding fiscal quarter, the last reported sales price of the Companys common stock for such trading day is greater than or equal to 130% of the applicable conversion price on such trading day share of common stock on such last trading day; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    in certain situations, when the trading price of the Notes is less than 98% of the product of the sale price of the Companys common stock and the conversion rate; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    upon the occurrence of specified corporate transactions described under the Notes Indenture, such as a consolidation, merger or binding share exchange; or ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    at any time on or after October 15, 2014. ##TABLE_END As of January 31, 2010, the Notes are not yet convertible into 6.7 million shares of the Companys common stock. Holders of the Notes have the right to require the Company to purchase with cash all or a portion of the Notes upon the occurrence of a fundamental change, such as a change of control at a purchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Notes plus accrued and unpaid interest. Following certain corporate transactions that constitute a change of control, the Company will increase the conversion rate for a holder who elects to convert the Notes in connection with such change of control in certain circumstances.  salesforce.com, inc. Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements(Continued)  In accounting for the issuance of the Notes, the Company separated the Notes into liability and equity components. The carrying amount of the liability component was calculated by measuring the fair value of a similar liability that does not have an associated convertible feature. The carrying amount of the equity component representing the conversion option was determined by deducting the fair value of the liability component from the par value of the Notes as a whole. The excess of the principal amount of the liability component over its carrying amount (debt discount) is amortized to interest expense over the term of the Note. The equity component is not remeasured as long as it continues to meet the conditions for equity classification. In accounting for the transaction costs related to the Note issuance, the Company allocated the total amount incurred to the liability and equity components. Transaction costs attributable to the liability component are being amortized to expense over the term of the Notes, and transaction costs attributable to the equity component were netted with the equity component in additional paid-in capital. Debt issuance costs, net of amortization, were $7.1 million as of January 31, 2010 and equity issuance costs were $1.8 million. Additionally, the Company recorded a deferred tax liability of $51.1 million in connection with the Notes. The Notes consisted of the following (in thousands): ##TABLE_START   As of January 31, 2010  Equity component (1)  $ 125,530      Liability component :  Principal  $ 575,000  Less: debt discount, net (2)   (124,802 )     Net carrying amount  $ 450,198      ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START (1) Included in the consolidated balance sheets within additional paid-in capital, net of the $1.8 million in equity issuance costs. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START (2) Included in the consolidated balance sheets within 0.75% convertible senior notes and is amortized over the remaining life of the Notes using the effective interest rate method. ##TABLE_END As of January 31, 2010, the remaining life of the Notes is approximately 5 years. The following table sets forth total interest expense recognized related to the Notes (in thousands): ##TABLE_START   Fiscal Year Ended January 31, 2010  Contractual interest expense  $ 144  Amortization of debt issuance costs   59  Amortization of debt discount   728       $ 931      Effective interest rate of the liability component   5.86 % ##TABLE_END Note Hedges To minimize the impact of potential economic dilution upon conversion of the Notes, the Company entered into convertible note hedge transactions with respect to its common stock (the Note Hedges). The Company  salesforce.com, inc. Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements(Continued)  paid an aggregate amount of $126.5 million for the Note Hedges. The Note Hedges cover, approximately 6.7 million shares of the Companys common stock at a strike price that corresponds to the initial conversion price of the Notes, also subject to adjustment, and are exercisable upon conversion of the Notes. The Note Hedges will expire upon the maturity of the Notes. The Note Hedges are intended to reduce the potential economic dilution upon conversion of the Notes in the event that the market value per share of the Companys common stock, as measured under the Notes, at the time of exercise is greater than the conversion price of the Notes. The Note Hedges are separate transactions and are not part of the terms of the Notes. Holders of the Notes will not have any rights with respect to the Note Hedges. The Company recorded a deferred tax asset of $51.4 million in connection with these Note Hedges. Warrants Separately, the Company also entered into warrant transactions (the Warrants), whereby the Company sold warrants to acquire, subject to anti-dilution adjustments, up to 6.7 million shares of the Companys common stock at a strike price of $119.51 per share. The Company received aggregate proceeds of $59.2 million from the sale of the Warrants. If the market value per share of the Companys common stock, as measured under the Warrants, exceeds the strike price of the Warrants, the Warrants will have a dilutive effect on the Companys earnings per share. The Warrants are separate transactions, entered into by the Company and are not part of the terms of the Notes or Note Hedges. Holders of the Notes will not have any rights with respect to the Warrants. 3. Stockholders Equity Stock Options Issued to Employees The 1999 Stock Option Plan (the 1999 Plan) provides for the issuance of incentive and non-statutory options to employees and nonemployees of the Company. On April 30, 2009, the 1999 Plan expired. Therefore, all remaining shares available expired. The expiration of the 1999 Plan did not affect awards outstanding under the 1999 Plan, which continue to be governed by the terms and conditions of the 1999 Plan. The Company also maintains the 2004 Equity Incentive Plan, 2004 Employee Stock Purchase Plan and the 2004 Outside Directors Stock Plan. These plans, other than the 1999 Plan and the 2004 Outside Directors Stock Plan, provide for annual automatic increases on February 1 to the shares reserved for issuance based on the lesser of (i) a specific percentage of the total number of shares outstanding at year end; (ii) a fixed number of shares; or (iii) a lesser number of shares set by the Companys Board of Directors, all as specified in the respective plans. On February 1, 2010, 3.5 million additional shares were reserved under the 2004 Equity Incentive Plan pursuant to the automatic increase. The 2004 Employee Stock Purchase Plan will not be implemented unless and until the Companys Board of Directors authorizes the commencement of one or more offerings under the plan. No offering periods have been authorized to date. In April 2006, the Companys Board of Directors approved the 2006 Inducement Equity Incentive Plan (the Inducement Plan) that allows for stock option and other equity incentive grants to employees in connection with merger or acquisition activity. In March 2009, the Board of Directors amended the Inducement Plan to increase the share reserve by 300,000 shares to 700,000 shares in total. As of January 31, 2010, there were 436,504 shares of common stock available for grant under the Inducement Plan. Prior to February 1, 2006, options issued under the Companys stock option plans were generally for periods not to exceed 10 years and were issued at fair value of the shares of common stock on the date of grant as determined by the trading price of such stock on the New York Stock Exchange. After February 1, 2006, options issued to employees are for periods not to exceed 5 years. Grants made pursuant to the 2004 Equity Incentive Plan and the Inducement Plan do not provide for the immediate exercise of options.  salesforce.com, inc.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements(Continued)  4. Preferred Stock The Companys board of directors has the authority, without further action by stockholders, to issue up to 5,000,000 shares of preferred stock in one or more series. The Companys board of directors may designate the rights, preferences, privileges and restrictions of the preferred stock, including dividend rights, conversion rights, voting rights, terms of redemption, liquidation preference, sinking fund terms, and number of shares constituting any series or the designation of any series. The issuance of preferred stock could have the effect of restricting dividends on the Companys common stock, diluting the voting power of its common stock, impairing the liquidation rights of its common stock, or delaying or preventing a change in control. The ability to issue preferred stock could delay or impede a change in control. At January 31, 2010 and 2009, no shares of preferred stock were outstanding. 5. Joint Venture On December 7, 2000, the Company entered into a joint venture agreement with SunBridge, Inc., a Japanese corporation, to establish Salesforce Japan. During fiscal 2009, the Company increased its ownership interest in the joint venture, from 65 to 72 percent in exchange for a cash payment of $21.6 million. The Company accounted for this investment as a step acquisition. The allocation of the purchase price was completed during fiscal 2009 with $19.2 million recorded as goodwill and the remainder to intangible assets. Provided that the Company owns at least 30 percent of the outstanding voting shares of the joint venture, the Company has the right to appoint three of the six board members of the joint venture, and together with SunBridge, may appoint a fourth director. Based on this and majority ownership the Company consolidates the results of Salesforce Japan. The Board of Directors of the joint venture has authorized option plans to purchase shares in Salesforce Japan. One of the option plans includes antidilution provisions such that the option holders are allowed additional options if the joint venture issues additional stock and the exercise price of their options is reduced if the additional stock is issued for an amount less than such exercise price. Given the Companys controlling interest in the joint venture, the accounts of the joint venture have been consolidated with the accounts of the Company, and a controlling interest has been recorded for the third partys interest in the net assets and operations of the joint venture to the extent of the controlling partners individual investments. Under the terms of the joint venture agreement, the joint venture agreement will terminate if the joint venture becomes a public company or is sold to a third party, or upon the mutual agreement of the parties. In addition, if the Company commits a breach of, or if the Company fails to perform, its material obligations under the joint venture agreement, which are not cured in a timely manner, SunBridge can require the Company to purchase all of its shares in the joint venture. The purchase price for SunBridges shares would be the then fair market value plus a specified premium. In the event that SunBridge commits a breach of, or if it fails to perform, its material obligations under the joint venture agreement, which it does not cure in a timely manner, or if SunBridge enters into bankruptcy proceedings, the Company can require SunBridge to sell to it all of its shares in the joint venture to the Company. The purchase price for SunBridges shares would be the then fair market value less a specified discount. Additionally, if the Company and SunBridge are unable to agree on certain operational matters, either party can require the other to purchase all of its shares of the joint venture at a price equal to the then fair value market value. Fair market value is to be determined by mutual agreement of the parties, or if the parties are unable to agree, by an independent appraiser.  salesforce.com, inc.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements(Continued)  Deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effect of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes. Significant components of the Companys deferred tax assets and liabilities were as follows (in thousands): ##TABLE_START   As of January 31,    2010   2009  Deferred tax assets:   Net operating loss carryforwards  $ 5,284   $ 6,212  Deferred stock compensation   30,451    26,288  Tax credits   20,836    14,004  Deferred rent expense   7,360    6,244  Accrued liabilities   22,006    19,304  Deferred revenue   10,802    11,372  Other   6,816    8,208          Total deferred tax assets   103,555    91,632  Less valuation allowance   (1,540 )   (2,344 )         Net deferred tax assets   102,015    89,288  Deferred tax liabilities:   Deferred commissions   (22,613 )   (18,274 ) Purchased intangibles   (4,184 )   (7,912 ) Unrealized gains on investments   (3,873 )   (626 ) Other   (3,650 )   (3,987 )         Total deferred tax liabilities   (34,320 )   (30,799 )         Net deferred tax assets  $ 67,695   $ 58,489          ##TABLE_END Realization of deferred tax assets is dependent on future earnings, if any, the timing and amount of which are uncertain. Accordingly, the deferred tax assets have been partially offset by a valuation allowance. The valuation allowance relates to net deferred tax assets from operating losses of certain foreign subsidiaries. The excess tax benefits associated with stock option exercises are recorded directly to stockholders equity controlling interest only when realized. As a result, the excess tax benefits included in net operating loss carryforwards but not reflected in deferred tax assets for fiscal year 2010 and 2009 are $8.5 million and $30.4 million, respectively. At January 31, 2010, the Company had net operating loss carryforwards for federal income tax purposes of approximately $33.5 million, which expire in 2020 through 2030, federal research and development tax credits of approximately $12.8 million, which expire in 2022 through 2030, foreign tax credits of $2.1 million, which expires in 2020, and minimum tax credits of $0.7 million, which have no expiration date. The Company also has state net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $166.0 million which expire beginning in 2012 and state research and development tax credits of approximately $11.8 million and $2.4 million of state enterprise zone tax credits, which do not expire. Utilization of the Companys net operating loss carryforwards may be subject to substantial annual limitation due to the ownership change limitations provided by the Internal Revenue Code and similar state provisions. Such an annual limitation could result in the expiration of the net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards before utilization.  salesforce.com, inc. Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements(Continued)  The Company had gross unrecognized tax benefits of $22.1 million and $16.5 million as of January 31, 2010 and January 31, 2009 respectively. A reconciliation of the beginning and ending balance of total unrecognized tax benefits for fiscal years 2010, 2009, and 2008 is as follows (in thousands): ##TABLE_START   Fiscal Year Ended January 31,   2010   2009   2008  Balance as of February 1,  $ 16,472   $ 11,771   $ 6,542  Tax positions taken in prior period:    Gross increases   457    17      Gross decreases   (707 )   (148 )   (125 ) Tax positions taken in current period:    Gross increases   5,401    5,955    5,129  Settlements   (212 )   (149 )     Currency translation effect   642    (974 )   225              Balance as of January 31,  $ 22,053   $ 16,472   $ 11,771              ##TABLE_END For fiscal year 2010, 2009, and 2008 total unrecognized tax benefits in an amount of $16.5 million, $11.8 million and $7.9 million respectively, if recognized, would reduce income tax expense and the Companys effective tax rate. The Company recognizes interest accrued and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in the income tax provision. As of January 31, 2010, the Company accrued no penalties and an immaterial amount of interest in income tax expense. Interest expense accrued for fiscal 2010, 2009 and 2008 was also immaterial. Tax positions for the Company and its subsidiaries are subject to income tax audits by many tax jurisdictions throughout the world. The Companys U.S. federal and state tax returns for all tax years since February 1999, which was the inception of the Company, remain open to examination. Outside the U.S., tax returns filed in major jurisdictions where the Company operates, including Canada, United Kingdom, and Australia generally remain open to examination for all tax years, while for Japan, the statute of limitations currently remains open for tax years after fiscal year 2003. Management does not believe that it is reasonably possible that the estimates of unrecognized tax benefits will change significantly in the next twelve months. However, an adverse resolution of one or more uncertain tax positions in any period could have a material impact on the results of operations for that period. 8. Commitments Letters of Credit As of January 31, 2010, the Company had a total of $10.6 million in letters of credit outstanding substantially in favor of its landlords for office space in San Francisco, California, New York City, Singapore, Sweden and Switzerland. These letters of credit renew annually and mature at various dates through October 2018. Leases The Company leases office space and equipment under noncancelable operating and capital leases with various expiration dates.  salesforce.com, inc. Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements(Continued)  As of January 31, 2010, the future minimum lease payments under noncancelable operating and capital leases are as follows (in thousands): ##TABLE_START   Capital Leases   Operating Leases Fiscal Period:   Fiscal 2011  $ 7,901   $ 81,941 Fiscal 2012   7,550    58,299 Fiscal 2013   1,074    44,103 Fiscal 2014       31,820 Fiscal 2015       13,360 Thereafter       50,686        Total minimum lease payments  $ 16,525   $ 280,209     Less: amount representing interest   (942 )       Present value of capital lease obligation  $ 15,583        ##TABLE_END The terms of the lease agreements provide for rental payments on a graduated basis. The Company recognizes rent expense on the straight-line basis over the lease period and has accrued for rent expense incurred but not paid. Of the total operating lease commitment balance of $280.2 million, $229.2 million is related to facilities space. The remaining $51.0 million commitment is related to computer equipment and other leases. The Companys agreements for the facilities and certain services provide the Company with the option to renew. The Companys future contractual obligations would change if the Company exercised these options. Rent expense for fiscal 2010, 2009 and 2008 was $47.3 million, $36.0 million and $23.0 million, respectively. 9. Legal Proceedings The Company is involved in various legal proceedings and receives claims from time to time, arising from the normal course of business activities. In the Companys opinion, resolution of these matters is not expected to have a material adverse impact on its consolidated results of operations, cash flows or its financial position. During fiscal 2009, the Company received a communication from a large technology company alleging that the Company infringed some of its patents. The Company continues to analyze the potential merits of these claims, the potential defenses to such claims and potential counter claims, and the possibility of a license agreement as an alternative to litigation. The Company is currently in discussions with this company and no litigation has been filed to date. However, there can be no assurance that this claim will not lead to litigation in the future. The resolution of this claim is not expected to have a material adverse effect on the Companys financial condition, but it could be material to the net income or cash flows or both of a particular quarter. The Company has been, and may in the future be, sued by third parties for alleged infringement of their proprietary rights. The Companys technologies may be subject to injunction if they are held to infringe the rights of a third party. The outcome of any litigation is inherently uncertain. Any intellectual property claims, including the one referenced above, with or without merit, could be time-consuming and expensive to resolve, could divert management attention from executing the Companys business plan and could require the Company to change the Companys technology, change the Companys business practices and/or pay monetary damages or enter into short- or long-term royalty or licensing agreements which may not be available in the future at the same terms or  salesforce.com, inc. Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements(Continued)  at all. In addition, many of the Companys subscription agreements require the Company to indemnify the Companys customers for third-party intellectual property infringement claims, which could increase the cost to the Company of an adverse ruling on such a claim. Any adverse determination related to intellectual property claims or litigation could prevent the Company from offering its service to others, could be material to the Companys net income or cash flows or both of a particular quarter or could otherwise adversely affect the Companys operating results. 10. Employee Benefit Plan The Company has a 401(k) plan covering all eligible employees in the United States. Since January 1, 2006, the Company has been contributing to the plan. Total Company contributions during fiscal 2010, 2009 and 2008, were $8.5 million, $6.7 million and $3.9 million, respectively. 11. Related-Party Transactions In January 1999, the salesforce.com/foundation, also referred to as the Foundation, a non-profit public charity, was chartered to build philanthropic programs that are focused on youth and technology. The Companys chairman is the chairman of the Foundation. He, one of the Companys employees and one of the Companys board members hold three of the Foundations seven board seats. The Company is not the primary beneficiary of the Foundations activities, and accordingly, the Company does not consolidate the Foundations statement of activities with its financial results. Since the Foundations inception, the Company has provided at no charge certain resources to Foundation employees such as office space. The value of these items totals approximately $35,000 per quarter during fiscal year 2010. In addition to the resource sharing with the Foundation, the Company issued the Foundation warrants in August 2002 to purchase 500,000 shares of common stock which were all exercised in prior years. As of January 31, 2010, the Foundation held 142,500 shares of salesforce.com common stock. Additionally, the Company has donated subscriptions to the Companys service to other qualified non-profit organizations. The fair value of these donated subscriptions were in excess of $3.7 million per month during fiscal 2010. The Company currently plans to continue providing free subscriptions to qualified non-profit organizations through its relationship with the Foundation.  salesforce.com, inc.

CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES ##TABLE_END (a) Evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures Our management with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures, as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) or 15d-15(e) promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, as of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K (the Evaluation Date). Based on this evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded as of the Evaluation Date that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective to provide reasonable assurance that the information required to be disclosed by us in periodic SEC reports is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure, and that such information is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms. (b) Managements Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f). Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of January 31, 2010 based on the guidelines established in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). Our internal control over financial reporting includes policies and procedures that provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external reporting purposes in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Based on the results of our evaluation, our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of January 31, 2010. We reviewed the results of managements assessment with our Audit Committee. The effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of January 31, 2010 has been audited by Ernst  Young LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in its report which is included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. (c) Changes in internal control over financial reporting There was no change in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended January 31, 2010 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. (d) Inherent Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls Our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, do not expect that our disclosure controls or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the  inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the Company have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty, and that breakdowns can occur because of a simple error or mistake. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people or by management override of the controls. The design of any system of controls also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions; over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or the degree of compliance with policies or procedures may deteriorate. Because of the inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected. ##TABLE_START ", "9B": " ITEM 9B.

BUSINESS ##TABLE_END Overview We are a leading provider of enterprise cloud computing applications. We provide a comprehensive customer and collaboration relationship management, or CRM, service to businesses of all sizes and industries worldwide and we provide a technology platform for customers and developers to build and run business applications. We were incorporated in Delaware in February 1999, and founded on the simple concept of delivering enterprise business applications via the Internet or cloud. Cloud computing refers to the use of Internet-based computing, storage and connectivity technology for a variety of different services. We introduced our first service in February 2000. Since then, we have augmented our CRM service with new editions and enhanced features. We introduced our Force.com platform to customers and developers so they can build complementary applications to extend beyond CRM. In 2010 we introduced our AppExchange directory of enterprise cloud computing applications that are integrated with our CRM service and in most cases have been developed on our platform by third parties. We also introduced Chatter, a collaboration application for the enterprise to connect and share information securely and in real-time. Our principal executive offices are located in San Francisco, California and our principal website address is www.salesforce.com . Our office address is The Landmark @ One Market, Suite 300, San Francisco, California 94105.  We designed and developed our applications to be easy-to-use and intuitive solutions that can be deployed rapidly, customized easily and integrated with other software applications. We deliver our service through any of the market-leading Web browsers. Customers who use our CRM and collaboration services and platform are able to avoid much of the expense and complexity of traditional enterprise software development and implementations. As a result, our customers incur less risk and lower upfront costs and benefit from increased productivity. We market our service to businesses on a subscription basis, primarily through our direct sales efforts and indirectly through partners. Through our Force.com platform and developer tools and our AppExchange, we also encourage third parties to develop additional functionality and applications that run on our platform, but which are sold separately from, or in conjunction with, our CRM service. Cloud Computing Cloud computing fundamentally changes the way enterprise business software applications are developed and deployed. Application developers no longer need to create and manage their own infrastructure of servers, storage, network devices, operating system software and development tools in order to create a business application. Instead, the entire infrastructure is managed by third parties who specialize in infrastructure management, and developers simply use an Internet browser to access the development environment. Application users can gain access to a variety of business applications via an Internet browser or mobile device, and are able to take advantage of a robust, secure, scalable and highly available application, without the cost and complexity of managing the hardware or software infrastructure. Our vision of enterprise cloud computing is based on a multi-tenant technology architecture and a subscription service business model. With multi-tenancy, multiple customers share application, platform and infrastructure services provided by the vendor. Today, we believe that the next phase of cloud computing is transforming enterprise software again. Driven by the consumerization of information technology (IT), our next phase of cloud computing will have three key characteristics  it will be social, mobile and open. With the popularity of social networking websites, new ways to communicate and collaborate based on feeds and status updates have emerged. In the enterprise market, that means enabling employees to easily find, share and collaborate on information. In addition, with the wide adoption of mobile phones and tablets, our customers now expect cloud computing technologies to be built for business to work on these devices, regardless of the carrier or operating system. We are working to provide these new kinds of cloud computing technologies to enterprise customers around the world. Cloud Applications Cloud applications enable businesses to subscribe to a wide variety of application services that are developed specifically for, and delivered over, the Internet on an as-needed basis with few or no implementation services required and without the need to install and manage third-party software or hardware in-house. Historically, only large businesses could afford to make investments in enterprise resource planning, CRM and collaboration applications to gain an enterprise-wide view of business information and automate and improve basic processes. However, cloud applications are available to businesses of all sizes and across all industries. Multi-tenant architectures enables cloud vendors like us to leverage a common infrastructure and software code base across all of our customers who benefit from access to the most current release of the application, periodic upgrades, more rapid innovation and the economies of a shared infrastructure. We believe the shift to cloud applications provides significant benefits even beyond those associated with multi-tenant infrastructure. Businesses are able to realize many of the benefits offered by traditional enterprise  software vendors, such as a comprehensive set of features and functionality and the ability to customize and integrate with other applications, while at the same time reducing the risks and lowering the total costs associated with owning enterprise software. As a result, we believe the continued emergence of cloud applications is bringing about a fundamental transformation in the enterprise software industry as businesses are offered the choice of replacing their purchased software with subscriptions to a wide range of application services. Cloud Platforms We believe that cloud applications and their related success in the market are the most widely understood segment of enterprise cloud computing. However, enterprise cloud computing also includes building applications on a cloud-based application development platform, also referred to as cloud platforms. Application developers use cloud platform technology to build both custom applications for individual businesses or vertical industries, and horizontal applications to address standard business processes that can be sold to a broad range of potential customers. Application developers include corporate IT departments that typically develop applications for a companys internal-use and independent software vendors (ISVs) that develop applications to sell to customers. Traditionally, these developers have needed to purchase, install, test and maintain complex software and hardware infrastructure to develop and deliver their applications. This requirement resulted in more time and resources being spent maintaining infrastructure and less time and resources being available to actually develop applications, with a resulting reduction in innovation and productivity levels. Cloud platforms enable corporate IT developers and ISVs to leverage the benefits of a multi-tenant platform for developing new applications. Cloud platforms allow developers to build applications using only a browser and an Internet connection, just as cloud applications allow users to use applications through a browser. In addition, developers typically pay no upfront costs when building cloud applications, with costs only to be incurred at the point of application deployment. Our cloud platforms provide application developers access to new capabilities that can be built into their business applications. These platforms include features popularized by social networking companies, such as profiles, status updates and feeds; and also the capability to extend applications for use on mobile devices. Our cloud platforms allow both IT departments and ISV developers to use several programming languages to build their applications. While there are many benefits to a language natively associated with a cloud platform, developers are able to use the most popular programming languages on our cloud platforms, such as Java and Ruby, to build their applications. Our cloud platforms support multiple languages to provide developers openness and choice. Our Solution Our CRM applications help companies better record, track, manage, analyze and share information regarding sales, customer service and support, and marketing operations. In 2010 we introduced Salesforce Chatter, a private social network for businesses. Our Force.com cloud computing platform, which was introduced in 2007, allows customers and partners to more extensively customize and integrate our applications or build entirely new cloud applications beyond CRM without having to invest in new software, hardware and related infrastructure. These newly developed applications, which run on our infrastructure, can then be used for internal operations or sold to third parties. We also offer the AppExchange, an online directory for cloud applications, where customers can browse, test-drive and deploy applications from salesforce.com and our partners.  The majority of our subscription and support revenue comes from subscriptions to our core CRM application and Force.com application development platform. In order for customers to install and run custom applications, whether built by themselves or by our partners, they must be a subscriber to our service. By subscribing to our service, our customers do not have to make large and potentially risky upfront investments in software, hardware, implementation services and IT staff as they would with traditional software solutions. We believe that our service enables businesses to rapidly achieve the benefits of higher productivity, and lower their total cost of ownership for their business application. Key advantages of our solution include: ##TABLE_START    Secure, scalable and reliable delivery platform. The delivery platform for our service has been designed to provide our customers with high levels of performance, reliability, and security. We have built, and continue to invest in, a comprehensive security infrastructure, including firewalls, intrusion detection systems, and encryption for transmissions over the Internet, which we monitor and test on a regular basis. We built and maintain a multi-tenant application architecture that has been designed to enable our service to scale securely, reliably, and cost-effectively. Our multi-tenant application architecture maintains the integrity and separation of customer data while still permitting all customers to use the same application functionality simultaneously. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    Rapid deployment. Our service can be deployed rapidly since our customers do not have to spend time procuring, installing or maintaining the servers, storage, networking equipment, security products, or other infrastructure hardware and software necessary to ensure a scalable and reliable service. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    Ease of integration. Our platform is designed to enable IT professionals to integrate our service with existing applications quickly and seamlessly. Our Force.com platform provides a set of application programming interfaces, or APIs, that enable customers and independent developers to both integrate our service with existing third-party, custom, and legacy applications and write their own application services that integrate with our service. For example, many of our customers use the Force.com API to move customer-related data from custom-developed and legacy applications into our service on a periodic basis to provide greater visibility into their activities. Other customers and partners have, for example, developed their own talent management solutions and procurement solutions on the Force.com platform. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    Rapid development of applications using the Force.com platform . Our customers and third party developers can develop applications rapidly because of the ease of use and the benefits of a multi-tenant platform. We provide the capability for business users to easily customize our applications to suit their specific needs, and also powerful programming language support so developers can code complex applications spanning multiple business processes. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    Increasing innovation. By providing infrastructure and development environments on demand, we provide developers the opportunity to create new and innovative applications without having to invest in hardware and distribution. A developer with an idea for a new application can log onto our platform, develop, test and support their system on Force.com and make the application accessible for a fee to our customers. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    Lower total cost of ownership. We enable customers to achieve significant upfront savings relative to the traditional enterprise software model. Customers benefit from the predictability of their future costs since they pay for the service on a per subscriber basis for the term of the subscription contract. All upgrades are included in our service, so customers are not burdened or disrupted by the periodic need to perform system upgrades. Because we implement all upgrades on our servers, new features and functionality automatically become part of our service on the release date and therefore benefit all of our customers immediately. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    High levels of user adoption. We have designed our service to be intuitive and easy to use. Since our service contains many tools and features recognizable to users of popular websites such as those of Amazon, Facebook, Google and Twitter, it has a more familiar user interface than typical enterprise CRM applications. As a result, our users do not require substantial training on how to use and benefit from our service. ##TABLE_END  Our Strategy Our objective is to be the leading provider of CRM application services. We also want to be the leading cloud computing platform on which our customers and partners build applications. Key elements of our strategy include: ##TABLE_START    Strengthening our existing CRM applications and extending into new functional areas within CRM. We designed our service to easily accommodate new features and functions. We intend to continue to add CRM features and functionality to our core service that we will make available to customers at no additional charge. We offer advanced editions for an additional subscription fee to customers that require enhanced CRM capabilities. We have a growing portfolio of applications that serve different customer segments and markets. During fiscal 2011 we acquired several companies in complementary businesses, joint ventures, services and technologies in an effort to strengthen and extend our service CRM offerings. We expect to continue to make such investments and acquisitions in the future. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    Pursuing new customers and new territories aggressively. We believe that our cloud application and platform offerings provide significant value for businesses of any size. As a result, we will continue to aggressively target businesses of all sizes, primarily through our direct sales force. We have steadily increased and plan to continue to increase the number of direct sales professionals we employ, and we intend to develop additional distribution channels for our service. We have created several editions of our service to address the distinct requirements of businesses of different sizes. We also believe that there is a substantial market opportunity for our service outside of North America. We plan to continue to aggressively market to customers outside of North America by recruiting local sales and support professionals and by building partnerships that help us add customers in these regions. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    Deepening relationships with our existing customer base. We believe there is significant opportunity to leverage our relationships with existing customers. As the customer realizes the benefits of our service, we aim to either upgrade our customers to higher priced editions or sell more subscriptions by targeting additional functional areas and business units within the customer organization and ultimately pursuing enterprise-wide deployments. We aim to have our customers renew their subscriptions at the end of their contractual terms and we run customer success and other programs in an effort to secure renewals of existing customers. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    Continuing to lead the industry transformation to the next phase of cloud computing . We believe that the market transformation to cloud applications and platforms is a growing trend in the information technology industry. With the popularity of social networking websites, new ways to communicate and collaborate based on feeds and status updates have emerged in the enterprise. We believe we have established a leadership position in the enterprise cloud computing industry as a successful vendor of CRM application services, an enabler for third parties to create their own cloud applications through our platform and a developer of cloud computing technologies with social, mobile and open characteristics to provide to enterprise customers around the world. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    Encouraging the development of third-party applications on our Force.com cloud computing platform . Our Force.com cloud computing platform enables existing customers, ISVs and third-party developers to develop and deliver cloud applications they have built in our multi-tenant environment. It is a platform on which applications can be created, tested, published, and run. In addition, these applications can be listed on the AppExchange, our online marketplace of cloud applications, or sold by ISVs. We believe the ecosystem of cloud developers and ISVs will address the business requirements of both current and potential customers. ##TABLE_END The Salesforce CRM Service Our comprehensive array of services enable customers and subscribers to systematically record, store, analyze, share, and act upon business data and to help businesses manage customer accounts, track sales leads, evaluate marketing campaigns, and provide post-sales service. We also enable companies to generate reports and  summaries of this data and share them with authorized individuals across functional areas. Most of the features of our service can be accessed through a variety of devices, including laptop computers, tablets and mobile devices. Additionally, our service is highly configurable in a short amount of time, enabling our customers to tailor its appearance, policy settings, language, workflow, reports, and other characteristics without the use of significant IT resources or consultants. Our CRM services are primarily marketed under two brands, the Sales Cloud and the Service Cloud: ##TABLE_START    Sales Cloud. The sales force automation features of our application services are marketed under our Sales Cloud brand. Through the Sales Cloud, users are able to be more productive through the automation of manual and repetitive tasks and access to better and more organized data about their current customers and prospects. Our customers are also able to establish a system and process for recording, tracking, and sharing information about sales opportunities, sales leads, sales forecasts, the sales process, and closed business, as well as managing sales territories. Our customers are also better able to manage unstructured information such as sales collateral, presentations, price lists, and video assets. In addition, the Sales Cloud encompasses partner relationship management functionality (including channel management and partner portals) and marketing automation (including campaigns, ROI tracking, and Google AdWords integration). ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    Service Cloud. Our customer service and support automation features are marketed under our Service Cloud brand. Through the Service Cloud, companies are able to maintain better relationships with their existing customers and more efficiently address a variety of service and support needs, such as advice about products and services, requests for repairs, complaints about faulty goods, and the need for additional goods and services. Using the Service Cloud, customers can leverage our complete cloud-computing platform to deliver a comprehensive solution for their customer service interactions across every service channel: call centers with phone, email, and chat; Web portals for self-service and customer collaboration; and community interactions within social networks. ##TABLE_END As of January 31, 2011, we offered five principal service editions: Contact Manager Edition, Group Edition, Professional Edition, Enterprise Edition, and Unlimited Edition. Chatter is included in each Edition. We derived over 90 percent of our revenues from subscriptions to, and support for, our service in fiscal 2011. ##TABLE_START    Contact Manager Edition. Contact Manager Edition, which is limited to five subscribers, is targeted primarily at individuals and small businesses that seek basic contact and customer management. Users can track customer contacts and manage tasks and activities. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    Group Edition. Group Edition, which is also limited to five subscribers, is targeted primarily at small businesses and workgroups that seek a basic sales force automation solution. Users can share important customer data and manage their customer relationsfrom the start of the sales cycle to closing the deal to providing basic customer service. In addition to everything available in Contact Manager Edition, Group Edition offers access to opportunities, accounts, contacts, tasks and basic reports. Using the Force.com platform, customers can further extend and customize Group Edition by adding additional custom tabs and/or a custom application. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    Professional Edition. Professional Edition is targeted primarily at medium-sized and large businesses that need a robust and complete CRM solution but do not need some of the more advanced administrative features and integration capabilities. Professional Edition offers companies a comprehensive CRM suite that business users can use to manage every aspect of the customer lifecycle. In addition to everything available in Group Edition, it provides users more advanced CRM functionality such as: forecasts, lead management, contract management, solutions, and online case capture. Professional Edition also comes with standard, easy-to-use customization, security and sharing, integration, and administration tools to facilitate any small to mid-sized deployment. Using the Force.com platform, Professional Edition customers have more flexibility than Group Edition customers to further extend and customize their service by adding more custom applications, custom tabs, and/or custom objects. ##TABLE_END  ##TABLE_START    Enterprise Edition. Enterprise Edition is designed to meet the complex business needs of large organizations with many divisions or departments. In addition to all of the functionality available in Professional Edition, Enterprise Edition offers customers: ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    advanced CRM functionality, such as territory management that uses a rule-based territory assignment engine to categorize accounts and users into territories, products, and schedules that track revenue and quantity by opportunities; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    multi-divisional sharing and permissions such as profile-based departmental security and sharing; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    workflow and business process control such as workflow automation tasks; and ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    enterprise customization and integration tools that can support large-scale deployments, such as APIs for back-office integration that enable companies to readily integrate Salesforce CRM with ERP applications and other data sources. Customers also have greater flexibility and control to fully extend and customize our service by adding more custom applications, custom tabs, and/or custom objects. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    Unlimited Edition. Unlimited Edition is our most fully featured edition, with exclusive features available only in Unlimited Edition and bundled add-on features included at a significant cost saving over the total price of the individual features. In addition to all of the functionality available in Enterprise Edition, Unlimited Edition includes unlimited installations from the AppExchange, increased customization and extension possibilities that customers can implement on their own, Premier Support with Administration and additional storage. In addition to Chatter Unlimited Edition includes all the features of Chatter Plus. ##TABLE_END Each of the editions described above entitles customers to our standard customer support services. For advanced customers with more complex business needs, we provide additional levels of fee-based customer support. In addition to the five editions, we continue to innovate and develop additional products and services as optional add-on subscriptions to better meet different customers needs. Collaboration Cloud We offer various collaboration cloud products such as Chatter, Chatter Plus, Chatter Mobile, Chatter Free and Chatter.com. Each of these products provides a private and secure corporate social network for companies of all sizes. Chatter is a core attribute of our Force.com platform and its social capabilities are an integral part of each of our service offerings. Force.com Platform The Force.com cloud computing platform, which is marketed under our Custom Cloud brand, enhances the attractiveness of our service, particularly to enterprise customers. The Force.com platform provides a feature set and technology environment for building business applications, including data models and objects to manage data, a workflow engine for managing collaboration of data between users, a user interface model to handle forms and other interactions, and a Web services API for programmatic access and integration. The Force.com platform provides the tools and infrastructure required to: ##TABLE_START    deploy our application service for CRM; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    customize and integrate existing enterprise software applications; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    create and deploy new business applications that are pre-integrated with our service and leverage the same user interface or customize the user interface specific to customer requirements; and ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    sample and deploy applications built by third parties from the AppExchange. ##TABLE_END  The AppExchange We offer the AppExchange, an online directory that provides customers a way to browse, test-drive, share, and install applications developed on our Force.com platform. Partners and developers can offer their applications on the AppExchange directory. This directory gives our users a way to find and install applications to expand their use of the Force.com platform to areas that are complementary to or extend beyond CRM. When installing an enterprise cloud computing application built by a third-party partner or developer, customers authorize the third-party provider access to their data. Because they are built, managed and provisioned by third parties, we do not warrant the functionality, security and integrity of the data transmission or processing. Professional Services We offer consulting, implementation and training services to our customers to facilitate the adoption of our enterprise cloud computing CRM application and platform services. Consulting services consist of services such as business process mapping, project management services and guidance on best practices in using our service. Implementation services include systems integration, technical architecture and development, configuration and data conversion as well as developing and delivering customized education programs for our customers. Most of our consulting and implementation engagements are billed on a time and materials basis. We offer a number of traditional classroom and online educational classes that address topics such as implementing, using, administering and developing on our service. We also offer classes for our partners who implement our service on behalf of our customers. We bill the traditional classroom and some of the online educational classes on a per person, per class basis. There is a selection of online educational classes available at no charge to customers who subscribe to our service. As the reach of our enterprise cloud computing application services has grown, partners and other third party consulting and professional service providers play an integral part in providing these services to our customers. Technology, Development and Operations Technology and Development We do not provide software that must be written to different hardware, operating system and database platforms, or that depends upon a customers unique systems environment. Rather, we have optimized our service to run on a specific database and operating system using the tools and platforms best suited to serve our customers. Performance, functional depth and the usability of our service drive our technology decisions and product direction. We built our service as a highly scalable, multi-tenant application. We use commercially available hardware and a combination of proprietary and commercially available software to provide our service. The application server is custom-built and runs on a lightweight Java Servlet and Java Server Pages engine. We have custom-built core services such as database connection pooling and user session management tuned to our specific architecture and environment, allowing us to continue to scale our service. We have combined a stateless environment, in which a user is not bound to a single server but can be routed in the most optimal way to any number of servers, with an advanced data caching layer. Our customers can access the service through any Web browser. Our service treats all customers as logically separate tenants in central applications and databases. As a result, we are able to spread the cost of delivering our service across our user base. In addition, because we do not have to manage thousands of distinct applications with their own business logic and database schemas, we believe that we can scale our business faster than traditional software vendors. Moreover, we can focus our resources on building new functionality to deliver to our customer base as a whole rather than on maintaining an infrastructure to support each of their distinct applications.  Our research and development efforts are focused on improving and enhancing the features, functionality and security of our existing service offerings as well as developing new proprietary services such as Force.com and Salesforce Chatter. In addition, from time to time we supplement our internal research and development activities with outside development resources and acquired technology. Because of our multi-tenant architecture, we are able to provide all of our customers with a service based on a single version of our application. We are able to upgrade all of our customers at the same time with each release. As a result, we do not have to maintain multiple versions of our application. Operations We currently serve our customers from third-party data center hosting facilities located in the United States and in Singapore. All of our hosting facilities are currently leased from Equinix, Dupont Fabros and NTT, except for offerings added through acquisitions, which are typically served through alternate facilities. The Equinix, Dupont Fabros and NTT facilities are built to the same critical systems building codes as hospitals and other vital infrastructure. The facilities are secured by around-the-clock guards; biometric access screening and escort controlled access, and are supported by on-site backup generators in the event of a power failure. As part of our current disaster recovery arrangements, all of our customers data is currently replicated in near real-time. This strategy is designed to both protect our customers data and ensure service continuity in the event of a major disaster. Even with the disaster recovery arrangements, our service could be interrupted. Our agreements with Equinix, Dupont Fabros and NTT are for them to supply space in its secure facilities as well as power or connection points for power and Internet connectivity. Bandwidth to the Internet is provided by multiple independent companies for all our facilities. We continuously monitor the performance of our service. The monitoring features we have built or licensed include centralized performance consoles, automated load distribution tools and various self-diagnostic tools and program. Customers We sell to businesses of all sizes. The number of paying subscriptions at each of our customers ranges from one to tens of thousands. None of our customers accounted for more than 5 percent of our revenues in fiscal 2011, 2010, or 2009. Sources of Revenue We generally recognize revenue ratably over the contract terms beginning on the commencement date of each contract. Amounts that have been invoiced are recorded in accounts receivable and in deferred revenue or revenue, depending on whether the revenue recognition criteria have been met. The deferred revenue balance on our consolidated balance sheet does not represent the total contract value of annual or multi-year, non-cancelable subscription agreements. Unbilled deferred revenue was over $1.5 billion as of January 31, 2011 and over $1.0 billion as of January 31, 2010. Unbilled deferred revenue represents future billings under our non-cancelable subscription agreements that have not been invoiced and, accordingly, are not recorded in deferred revenue. We expect that the amount of unbilled deferred revenue will change from year-to-year for several reasons, including the specific timing and duration of large customer subscription agreements, varying billing cycles of subscription agreements, the specific timing of customer renewals, foreign currency fluctuations, the timing of when unbilled deferred revenue is to be recognized as revenue, and changes in customer financial circumstances. For multi-year subscription agreements billed annually, the associated unbilled deferred revenue is typically high at the beginning of the contract period, zero just prior to renewal, and increases if the agreement is renewed. Low unbilled deferred revenue attributable to a particular subscription agreement is often associated with an impending renewal and may not be an indicator of the likelihood of renewal or future revenue from such customer. Accordingly, we expect that the amount of aggregate unbilled deferred revenue will change from year-to-year depending in part upon the number and dollar amount of subscription agreements at particular stages in their renewal cycle. Such fluctuations are not a reliable indicator of future revenues.  Sales, Marketing and Customer Support We organize our sales and marketing programs by geographic regions, including North America, Europe, and Asia Pacific which includes Japan. Over 30 percent of our revenue comes from customers outside of North America. Direct Sales We sell subscriptions to our service primarily through our direct sales force comprised of inside sales, which consists of personnel that sell to customers primarily by phone, and field sales personnel, that are primarily based in geographic territories comprising customers and prospects. Both our inside sales and field sales personnel are supported by telesales representatives who are primarily responsible for generating qualifying leads. Our small business, general business and enterprise account executives and account managers focus their efforts on small, medium-size and large enterprises, respectively. Referral and Indirect Sales We have a network of partners who refer customer prospects to us and assist us in selling to these prospects. The network includes consulting firms, other technology vendors, systems integrators and partners in markets where we do not have a large direct sales presence. In return, we typically pay these partners a fee based on the first-year subscription revenue generated by the customers they refer. We expense these fees at the time the customer signs the subscription service contract. We also continue to develop distribution channels for our subscription service. Marketing Our marketing strategy is to continually elevate our brand and generate significant demand for our offerings. We use a variety of marketing programs to target our prospective and current customers, partners, and developers. Our primary marketing activities include: ##TABLE_START    press and industry analyst relations to garner third-party validation and generate positive coverage for our company and product strategy; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    user conferences and launch events, as well as participation in trade shows and industry events, to create customer awareness and prospect enthusiasm; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    search engine marketing and advertising to drive traffic to our Web properties; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    Web site development to engage and educate prospects and generate interest through product information and demonstrations, free trials, case studies, white papers, and marketing collateral; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    use of social network solutions such as YouTube; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    email, direct mail, and phone campaigns to capture leads that can be funneled into our sales organization; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    use of customer testimonials; and ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    sales tools and field marketing events to enable our sales organization to more effectively convert pipeline into completed transactions. ##TABLE_END  Customer Service and Support Our global customer support group responds to both business and technical inquires from our customers relating to how to use our products and is available to customers by the web, telephone and email. Basic customer support during business hours is available at no charge to customers who purchase any of our paying editions. Premier customer support includes extended availability and additional services, such as an assigned support representative and/or administrator. Premier customer support is available for a separate fee, or is included in our Unlimited Edition. Additional support services include developer support and partner support. Seasonality Our fourth quarter has historically been our strongest quarter for new business. For a more detailed discussion, see the Seasonal Nature of Deferred Revenue and Accounts Receivable discussion in Managements Discussion and Analysis. Competition The market for enterprise CRM business applications and development platforms is highly competitive, rapidly evolving and fragmented, and subject to changing technology, shifting customer needs and frequent introductions of new products and services. Many prospective customers have invested substantial personnel and financial resources to implement and integrate traditional enterprise software into their businesses, and therefore may be reluctant or unwilling to migrate to an enterprise cloud computing application service. Additionally, third party developers may be reluctant to build application services on our platform since they have invested significantly in other competing technology products. We compete primarily with vendors of packaged CRM software and companies offering on-demand CRM applications. We also compete with internally developed applications and face, or expect to face, competition from enterprise software vendors and online service providers who may develop toolsets and products that allow customers to build new applications that run on the customers current infrastructure or as hosted services. Our current principal competitors include: ##TABLE_START    enterprise software application vendors; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    on-demand CRM application service providers; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    enterprise software application service providers; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    traditional platform development environment companies; and ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    cloud computing development platform companies. ##TABLE_END We believe that as enterprise software application and platform vendors shift more of their focus to cloud computing, they will be a greater competitive threat. We believe the principal competitive factors in our market include the following: ##TABLE_START    proven track record of customer success; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    speed and ease of implementation; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    product functionality; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    financial stability and viability of the vendor; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    product adoption; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    ease of use and rates of user adoption; ##TABLE_END  ##TABLE_START    low total cost of ownership and demonstrable cost-effective benefits for customers; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    performance, security, scalability, flexibility and reliability of the service; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    ease of integration with existing applications; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    quality of customer support; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    availability and quality of implementation, consulting and training services; and ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    vendor reputation and brand awareness. ##TABLE_END Intellectual Property We rely on a combination of trademark, copyright, trade secret and patent laws in the United States and other jurisdictions as well as confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions to protect our proprietary technology and our brand. We also enter into confidentiality and proprietary rights agreements with our employees, consultants and other third parties and control access to software, documentation and other proprietary information. As of January 31, 2011, we have a number of issued U.S. patents and hundreds of pending U.S. and international patent applications. We have received in the past, and may receive in the future, communications from third parties claiming that we have infringed the intellectual property rights of others. The cost to defend or settle these claims could be material to the net income or cash flows or both of a particular quarter. The outcome of any litigation is inherently uncertain. Any intellectual property claims, with or without merit, could be time-consuming and expensive to resolve, could divert management attention from executing our business plan and could require us to change our technology, change our business practices and/or pay monetary damages or enter into short- or long-term royalty or licensing agreements which may not be available in the future at the same terms or at all. In addition, many of our subscription agreements require us to indemnify our customers for third-party intellectual property infringement claims, which would increase the cost to us of an adverse ruling on such a claim. Any adverse determination related to intellectual property claims or litigation could prevent us from offering our service to others, or could otherwise adversely affect our operating results or cash flows or both in a particular quarter. Employees As of January 31, 2011, we had 5,306 employees. None of our employees is represented by a labor union. Available Information You can obtain copies of our Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K, and other filings with the SEC, and all amendments to these filings, free of charge from our Web site at http://www.salesforce.com/company/investor/sec-filings/ as soon as reasonably practicable following our filing of any of these reports with the SEC.

RISK FACTORS ##TABLE_END The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones facing us. Other events that we do not currently anticipate or that we currently deem immaterial also may affect our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. Risks Related to Our Business and Industry Defects or disruptions in our service could diminish demand for our service and subject us to substantial liability. Because our service is complex and we have incorporated a variety of new computer hardware and software which is developed in-house and acquired from third party vendors, our service may have errors or defects that users identify after they begin using it that could result in unanticipated downtime for our subscribers and harm our reputation and our business. Internet-based services frequently contain undetected errors when first introduced or when new versions or enhancements are released. We have from time to time found defects in our service and new errors in our existing service may be detected in the future. In addition, our customers may use our service in unanticipated ways that may cause a disruption in service for other customers attempting to access their data. Since our customers use our service for important aspects of their business, any errors, defects, disruptions in service or other performance problems with our service could hurt our reputation and may damage our customers businesses. If that occurs, customers could elect not to renew, or delay or withhold payment to us, we could lose future sales or customers may make warranty or other claims against us, which could result in an increase in our provision for doubtful accounts, an increase in collection cycles for accounts receivable or the expense and risk of litigation. Interruptions or delays in service from our third-party data center hosting facilities could impair the delivery of our service and harm our business. We currently serve our customers from third-party data center hosting facilities located in the United States and Singapore. Any damage to, or failure of, our systems generally could result in interruptions in our service. As we continue to add data centers and add capacity in our existing data centers, we may move or transfer our data and our customers data. Despite precautions taken during this process, any unsuccessful data transfers may impair the delivery of our service. Further, any damage to, or failure of, our systems generally could result in interruptions in our service. Interruptions in our service may reduce our revenue, cause us to issue credits or pay penalties, cause customers to terminate their subscriptions and adversely affect our renewal rates and our ability to attract new customers. Our business will also be harmed if our customers and potential customers believe our service is unreliable. As part of our current disaster recovery arrangements, our production environment and all of our customers data is currently replicated in near real-time in a facility located on the east coast of the United States. Companies and products added through acquisition may be temporarily served through alternate facilities. We do not control the operation of any of these facilities, and they are vulnerable to damage or interruption from earthquakes, floods, fires, power loss, telecommunications failures and similar events. They may also be subject to break-ins, sabotage, intentional acts of vandalism and similar misconduct. Despite precautions taken at these facilities, the occurrence of a natural disaster or an act of terrorism, a decision to close the facilities without adequate notice or other unanticipated problems at these facilities could result in lengthy interruptions in our service. Even with the disaster recovery arrangements, our service could be interrupted. If our security measures are breached and unauthorized access is obtained to a customers data or our data or our information technology systems, our service may be perceived as not being secure, customers may curtail or stop using our service and we may incur significant legal and financial exposure and liabilities. Our service involves the storage and transmission of customers proprietary information, and security breaches could expose us to a risk of loss of this information, litigation and possible liability. These security  measures may be breached as a result of third-party action, including intentional misconduct by computer hackers, employee error, malfeasance or otherwise, during transfer of data to additional data centers or at any time, and result in someone obtaining unauthorized access to our customers data or our data, including our intellectual property and other confidential business information, or our information technology systems. Additionally, third parties may attempt to fraudulently induce employees or customers into disclosing sensitive information such as user names, passwords or other information in order to gain access to our customers data or our data, including our intellectual property and other confidential business information, or our information technology systems. Because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access, or to sabotage systems, change frequently and generally are not recognized until launched against a target, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures. In addition, our customers may authorize third party technology providers, whose applications are available through our AppExchange directory, to access their customer data. Because we do not control the transmissions between our customers and third-party AppExchange technology providers, or the processing of such data by third-party AppExchange technology providers, we cannot ensure the complete integrity or security of such transmissions or processing. Any security breach could result in a loss of confidence in the security of our service, damage our reputation, disrupt our business, lead to legal liability and negatively impact our future sales. Because we recognize revenue from subscriptions for our service over the term of the subscription, downturns or upturns in sales may not be immediately reflected in our operating results. We generally recognize revenue from customers ratably over the terms of their subscription agreements, which are typically 12 to 24 months, although terms can range from one to 60 months. As a result, most of the revenue we report in each quarter is derived from the recognition of deferred revenue relating to subscription agreements entered into during previous quarters. Consequently, a decline in new or renewed subscriptions in any one quarter may not be immediately reflected in our revenue results for that quarter. Such a decline, however, will negatively affect our revenue in future quarters. Accordingly, the effect of significant downturns in sales and market acceptance of our service, and potential changes in our rate of renewals may not be fully reflected in our results of operations until future periods. Our subscription model also makes it difficult for us to rapidly increase our revenue through additional sales in any period, as revenue from new customers must be recognized over the applicable subscription term. In addition, we may be unable to adjust our cost structure to reflect the changes in revenues. We cannot accurately predict subscription renewal or upgrade rates and the impact these rates may have on our future revenue and operating results. Our customers have no obligation to renew their subscriptions for our service after the expiration of their initial subscription period, which is typically 12 to 24 months, and in fact, some customers have elected not to renew. In addition, our customers may renew for fewer subscriptions, renew for shorter contract lengths, or renew for lower cost editions of our service. We cannot accurately predict renewal rates, particularly for our enterprise customers who purchase a large number of subscriptions under multiyear contracts and for our small and medium size business customers. Our renewal rates may decline or fluctuate as a result of a number of factors, including customer dissatisfaction with our service, customers ability to continue their operations and spending levels, decreases in the number of users at our customers and deteriorating general economic conditions. If our customers do not renew their subscriptions for our service or reduce the number of paying subscriptions at the time of renewal, our revenue will decline and our business will suffer. Our future success also depends in part on our ability to sell additional features and services, more subscriptions or enhanced editions of our service to our current customers. This may also require increasingly sophisticated and costly sales efforts that are targeted at senior management. Similarly, the rate at which our customers purchase new or enhanced services depends on a number of factors, including general economic conditions. If our efforts to upsell to our customers are not successful, our business may suffer.  If we experience significant fluctuations in our rate of anticipated growth and fail to balance our expenses with our revenue forecasts, our results could be harmed. Due to our evolving business model and the unpredictability of future general economic and financial market conditions, we may not be able to accurately forecast our rate of growth. We plan our expense levels and investment on estimates of future revenue and future anticipated rate of growth. We may not be able to adjust our spending quickly enough if the addition of new subscriptions or the renewal rate for existing subscriptions falls short of our expectations. As a result, we expect that our revenues, operating results and cash flows may fluctuate significantly on a quarterly basis. Our recent revenue growth rates may not be sustainable and may decline in the future. We believe that period-to-period comparisons of our revenues, operating results and cash flows may not be meaningful and should not be relied upon as an indication of future performance. We have been and may in the future be sued by third parties for alleged infringement of their proprietary rights. The software and Internet industries are characterized by the existence of a large number of patents, trademarks and copyrights and by frequent litigation based on allegations of infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights. We have received in the past and may receive in the future communications from third parties claiming that we have infringed the intellectual property rights of others. In addition we have been, and may in the future be, sued by third parties for alleged infringement of their proprietary rights. Our technologies may be subject to injunction if they are held to infringe the rights of a third party or we may be required to pay damages or both. The outcome of any litigation, regardless of its merits, is inherently uncertain. Any intellectual property claims and lawsuits could be time-consuming and expensive to resolve, divert management attention from executing our business plan and require us to change our technology, change our business practices and/or pay monetary damages or enter into short- or long-term royalty or licensing agreements. Many of our subscription agreements require us to indemnify our customers for third-party intellectual property infringement claims, which would increase the cost to us of an adverse ruling on such a claim. Any adverse determination related to intellectual property claims or litigation could prevent us from offering our service to others, could be material to our net income or cash flows (or both) or could otherwise adversely affect our operating results. Our exposure to risks associated with the use of intellectual property may be increased as a result of acquisitions, as we have a lower level of visibility into the development process with respect to such technology or the care taken to safeguard against infringement risks. In addition, third parties may make infringement and similar or related claims after we have acquired technology that had not been asserted prior to our acquisition. Our quarterly results can fluctuate and our stock price and the value of your investment could decline substantially. Our quarterly operating results are likely to fluctuate. For example, our fourth quarter has historically been our strongest quarter for new business and renewals. The year-over-year compounding effect of this seasonality in billing patterns and overall new business and renewal activity causes the value of invoices that we generate in the fourth quarter to continually increase in proportion to our billings in the other three quarters of our fiscal year. Additionally, some of the important factors that may cause our revenues, operating results and cash flows to fluctuate from quarter to quarter include: ##TABLE_START    our ability to retain and increase sales to existing customers, attract new customers and satisfy our customers requirements; ##TABLE_END  ##TABLE_START    the renewal rates for our service; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    the amount and timing of operating costs and capital expenditures related to the operations and expansion of our business; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    the number of new employees added; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    changes in our pricing policies whether initiated by us or as a result of intense competition; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    the cost, timing and management effort for the introduction of new features to our service; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    the rate of expansion and productivity of our sales force; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    the length of the sales cycle for our service; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    new product and service introductions by our competitors; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    our success in selling our service to large enterprises; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    variations in the revenue mix of editions of our service; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    technical difficulties or interruptions in our service; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    expenses related to developing our new global headquarters and increasing our data center capacity and expanding our data centers domestically and internationally; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    changes in foreign currency exchange rates; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    changes in interest rates and our mix of investments, which would impact our return on our investments in cash and marketable securities; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    conditions, particularly sudden changes, in the financial markets have and may continue to impact the value of and access to our investment portfolio; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    changes in the effective tax rates; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    general economic conditions that may adversely affect either our customers ability or willingness to purchase additional subscriptions or upgrade their service, or delay a prospective customers purchasing decision, or reduce the value of new subscription contracts, or affect renewal rates; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    timing of additional investments in our enterprise cloud computing application and platform services and in our consulting service; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    changes in deferred revenue balances due to the seasonal nature of our customer invoicing, changes in the average duration of our invoices, rate of renewals and the rate of new business growth; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    regulatory compliance costs; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    the timing of customer payments and payment defaults by customers; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    costs associated with acquisitions of companies and technologies; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    extraordinary expenses such as litigation or other dispute-related settlement payments; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    the impact of new accounting pronouncements; and ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    the timing of stock awards to employees and the related adverse financial statement impact of having to expense those stock awards ratably over their vesting schedules. ##TABLE_END Many of these factors are outside of our control, and the occurrence of one or more of them might cause our operating results to vary widely. As such, we believe that quarter-to-quarter comparisons of our revenues, operating results and cash flows may not be meaningful and should not be relied upon as an indication of future performance.  Additionally, we may fail to meet or exceed the expectations of securities analysts and investors, and the market price of our common stock could decline. If one or more of the securities analysts who cover us change their recommendation regarding our stock adversely, the market price of our common stock could decline. Moreover, our stock price may be based on expectations, estimates or forecasts of our future performance that may be unrealistic or that may not be met. Further, our stock price may be affected by financial media, including television, radio and press reports and blogs. Weakened global economic conditions may adversely affect our industry, business and results of operations. Our overall performance depends in part on worldwide economic conditions. The United States and other key international economies have experienced in the past a downturn in which economic activity was impacted by falling demand for a variety of goods and services, restricted credit, poor liquidity, reduced corporate profitability, volatility in credit, equity and foreign exchange markets, bankruptcies and overall uncertainty with respect to the economy. These conditions affect the rate of information technology spending and could adversely affect our customers ability or willingness to purchase our enterprise cloud computing services, delay prospective customers purchasing decisions, reduce the value or duration of their subscription contracts, or affect renewal rates, all of which could adversely affect our operating results. As we acquire companies or technologies, they could prove difficult to integrate, disrupt our business, dilute stockholder value and adversely affect our operating results and the value of your investment. As part of our business strategy, we periodically make investments in, or acquisitions of, complementary businesses, joint ventures, services and technologies, and we expect that we will continue to make such investments and acquisitions in the future. Acquisitions and investments involve numerous risks, including: ##TABLE_START    the potential failure to achieve the expected benefits of the combination or acquisition; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    difficulties in and the cost of integrating operations, technologies, services and personnel; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    diversion of financial and managerial resources from existing operations; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    risk of entering new markets in which we have little or no experience or where competitors may have stronger market positions; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    potential write-offs of acquired assets or investments; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    potential loss of key employees; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    inability to generate sufficient revenue to offset acquisition or investment costs; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    the inability to maintain relationships with customers and partners of the acquired business; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    the difficulty of incorporating acquired technology and rights into our products and services and of maintaining quality standards consistent with our brand; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    potential unknown liabilities associated with the acquired businesses; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    unanticipated expenses related to acquired technology and its integration into existing technology; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    negative impact to our results of operations because of the depreciation and amortization of amounts related to acquired intangible assets, fixed assets and deferred compensation, and the loss of acquired deferred revenue; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    delays in customer purchases due to uncertainty related to any acquisition; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    the need to implement controls, procedures and policies appropriate for a public company at companies that prior to the acquisition lacked such controls, procedures and policies; and ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    challenges caused by distance, language and cultural differences. ##TABLE_END  In addition, if we finance acquisitions by issuing equity or convertible debt securities, our existing stockholders may be diluted which could affect the market price of our common stock. Further, if we fail to properly evaluate and execute acquisitions or investments, our business and prospects may be seriously harmed and the value of your investment may decline. We rely on third-party computer hardware and software that may be difficult to replace or which could cause errors or failures of our service. We rely on computer hardware purchased or leased and software licensed from third parties in order to offer our service, including database software from Oracle Corporation. This hardware and software may not continue to be available at reasonable prices or on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. Any loss of the right to use any of this hardware or software could significantly increase our expenses and otherwise result in delays in the provisioning of our service until equivalent technology is either developed by us, or, if available, is identified, obtained and integrated. Any errors or defects in third-party hardware or software could result in errors or a failure of our service which could harm our business. If the market for our technology delivery model and enterprise cloud computing services develops more slowly than we expect, our business could be harmed. The market for enterprise cloud computing application services is not as mature as the market for packaged enterprise software, and it is uncertain whether these services will achieve and sustain high levels of demand and market acceptance. Our success will depend to a substantial extent on the willingness of enterprises, large and small, to increase their use of enterprise cloud computing application services in general, and for CRM in particular. Many enterprises have invested substantial personnel and financial resources to integrate traditional enterprise software into their businesses, and therefore may be reluctant or unwilling to migrate to an enterprise cloud computing application service. Furthermore, some enterprises may be reluctant or unwilling to use enterprise cloud computing application services because they have concerns regarding the risks associated with security capabilities, among other things, of the technology delivery model associated with these services. If enterprises do not perceive the benefits of enterprise cloud computing application services, then the market for these services may not develop at all, or it may develop more slowly than we expect, either of which would significantly adversely affect our operating results. In addition, we may make errors in predicting and reacting to relevant business trends, which could harm our business. Our success also depends on the willingness of third-party developers to build applications that are complementary to our service. Without the development of these applications, both current and potential customers may not find our service sufficiently attractive. In addition, for those customers who authorize third-party technology partner access to their data, we do not warrant the functionality, security and integrity of the data transmission or processing. Despite contract provisions to protect us, customers may look to us to support and warrant the third-party applications, which may expose us to potential claims, liabilities and obligations for applications we did not develop or sell. The market in which we participate is intensely competitive, and if we do not compete effectively, our operating results could be harmed. The market for enterprise CRM business applications and development platforms is highly competitive, rapidly evolving and fragmented, and subject to changing technology, shifting customer needs and frequent introductions of new products and services. We compete primarily with vendors of packaged CRM software and companies offering on-demand CRM applications. We also compete with internally developed applications and face, or expect to face, competition from enterprise software vendors and online service providers who may develop toolsets and products that allow customers to build new applications that run on the customers current infrastructure or as hosted services. Our current competitors include: ##TABLE_START    enterprise software application vendors; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    on-demand CRM application service providers; ##TABLE_END  ##TABLE_START    enterprise software application service providers; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    traditional platform development environment companies; and ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    cloud computing development platform companies. ##TABLE_END Many of our current and potential competitors enjoy substantial competitive advantages, such as greater name recognition, longer operating histories and larger marketing budgets, as well as substantially greater financial, technical and other resources. In addition, many of our current and potential competitors have established marketing relationships and access to larger customer bases, and have major distribution agreements with consultants, system integrators and resellers. As a result, our competitors may be able to respond more quickly and effectively than we can to new or changing opportunities, technologies, standards or customer requirements. Furthermore, because of these advantages, even if our service is more effective than the products that our competitors offer, potential customers might accept competitive products and services in lieu of purchasing our service. For all of these reasons, we may not be able to compete successfully against our current and future competitors. Our efforts to expand our service beyond the CRM market and to develop our existing service in order to keep pace with technological developments may not succeed and may reduce our revenue growth rate and/or harm our business. We derive substantially all of our revenue from subscriptions to our CRM enterprise cloud computing application service, and we expect this will continue for the foreseeable future. The market for our Force.com cloud computing platform is relatively new and it is uncertain whether our efforts will ever result in significant revenue for us. Further, the introduction of new services beyond the CRM market may not be successful, and early stage interest and adoption of such new services may not result in long term success or significant revenue for us. Our efforts to expand our service beyond the CRM market may not succeed and may reduce our revenue growth rate. Additionally, if we are unable to develop enhancements to and new features for our existing service or new services that keep pace with rapid technological developments, our business will be harmed. The success of enhancements, new features and services depends on several factors, including the timely completion, introduction and market acceptance of the feature or edition. Failure in this regard may significantly impair our revenue growth. In addition, because our service is designed to operate on a variety of network hardware and software platforms using a standard browser, we will need to continuously modify and enhance our service to keep pace with changes in Internet-related hardware, software, communication, browser and database technologies. We may not be successful in either developing these modifications and enhancements or in timely bringing them to market. Furthermore, uncertainties about the timing and nature of new network platforms or technologies, or modifications to existing platforms or technologies, could increase our research and development or service delivery expenses. Any failure of our service to operate effectively with future network platforms and technologies could reduce the demand for our service, result in customer dissatisfaction and harm our business. Supporting our existing and growing customer base could strain our personnel resources and infrastructure, and if we are unable to scale our operations and increase productivity, we may not be able to successfully implement our business plan. We continue to experience significant growth in our customer base, which has placed a strain on our management, administrative, operational and financial infrastructure. We anticipate that additional investments in our infrastructure and research and development spending will be required to scale our operations and increase productivity, to address the needs of our customers, to further develop and enhance our service, and to expand into new geographic areas.  Our success will depend in part upon the ability of our senior management to manage our projected growth effectively. To do so, we must continue to increase the productivity of our existing employees and to hire, train and manage new employees as needed. To manage the expected domestic and international growth of our operations and personnel, we will need to continue to improve our operational, financial and management controls and our reporting systems and procedures. The additional investments we are making will increase our cost base, which will make it more difficult for us to offset any future revenue shortfalls by reducing expenses in the short term. If we fail to successfully scale our operations and increase productivity, we will be unable to execute our business plan. As more of our sales efforts are targeted at larger enterprise customers, our sales cycle may become more time-consuming and expensive, we may encounter pricing pressure and implementation and customization challenges, and we may have to delay revenue recognition for some complex transactions, all of which could harm our business and operating results. As we target more of our sales efforts at larger enterprise customers, we will face greater costs, longer sales cycles and less predictability in completing some of our sales. In this market segment, the customers decision to use our service may be an enterprise-wide decision and, if so, these types of sales would require us to provide greater levels of education regarding the use and benefits of our service, as well as education regarding privacy and data protection laws and regulations to prospective customers with international operations. In addition, larger customers may demand more customization, integration services and features. As a result of these factors, these sales opportunities may require us to devote greater sales support and professional services resources to individual customers, driving up costs and time required to complete sales and diverting our own sales and professional services resources to a smaller number of larger transactions, while potentially requiring us to delay revenue recognition on some of these transactions until the technical or implementation requirements have been met. Professional services may also be performed by a third party or a combination of our own staff and a third party. Our strategy is to work with third parties to increase the breadth of capability and depth of capacity for delivery of these services to our customers. If a customer is not satisfied with the quality of work performed by us or a third party or with the type of services or solutions delivered, then we could incur additional costs to address the situation, the profitability of that work might be impaired, and the customers dissatisfaction with our services could damage our ability to obtain additional work from that customer. In addition, negative publicity related to our customer relationships, regardless of its accuracy, may further damage our business by affecting our ability to compete for new business with current and prospective customers. Periodic changes of our sales organization can be disruptive and may negatively impact our revenues. We periodically change and make adjustments to our sales organization in response to market opportunities, competitive threats, management changes, product introductions or enhancements, acquisitions, sales performance, increases in sales headcount, cost levels, and other internal and external considerations. In the past, these changes sometimes resulted in a temporary lack of focus and reduced productivity; these effects could recur in connection with any future sales changes we might undertake and our rate of revenue growth could be negatively affected. In addition, any significant change to the way we structure our compensation of our sales organization may be disruptive and may affect our revenue growth. Any failure to protect our intellectual property rights could impair our ability to protect our proprietary technology and our brand. If we fail to protect our intellectual property rights adequately, our competitors might gain access to our technology, and our business might be harmed. In addition, defending our intellectual property rights might entail significant expense. Any of our trademarks or other intellectual property rights may be challenged by others or invalidated through administrative process or litigation. While we have some U.S. patents and many  U.S. and international patent applications pending, we may be unable to obtain patent protection for the technology covered in our patent applications. In addition, our existing patents and any patents issued in the future may not provide us with competitive advantages, or may be successfully challenged by third parties. Furthermore, legal standards relating to the validity, enforceability and scope of protection of intellectual property rights are uncertain. Effective patent, trademark, copyright and trade secret protection may not be available to us in every country in which our service is available. The laws of some foreign countries may not be as protective of intellectual property rights as those in the U.S., and mechanisms for enforcement of intellectual property rights may be inadequate. Accordingly, despite our efforts, we may be unable to prevent third parties from infringing upon or misappropriating our intellectual property. We might be required to spend significant resources to monitor and protect our intellectual property rights. We may initiate claims or litigation against third parties for infringement of our proprietary rights or to establish the validity of our proprietary rights. Any litigation, whether or not it is resolved in our favor, could result in significant expense to us and divert the efforts of our technical and management personnel. If we fail to develop our brands, our business may suffer. We believe that developing and maintaining awareness of the salesforce.com brand and our other brands is critical to achieving widespread acceptance of our existing and future services and is an important element in attracting new customers. In the past, our efforts to build our brands have involved significant expense. Brand promotion activities may not yield increased revenue, and even if they do, any increased revenue may not offset the expenses we incurred in building our brands. If we fail to successfully promote and maintain our brands, or incur substantial expenses in an unsuccessful attempt to promote and maintain our brands, we may fail to attract enough new customers or retain our existing customers to the extent necessary to realize a sufficient return on our brand-building efforts, and our business could suffer. We may not realize the anticipated benefits in connection with our purchase of undeveloped land in San Francisco where we plan to develop our global headquarters. If we do not realize these benefits, our financial performance will be negatively impacted. In November 2010, we purchased approximately 14 acres of undeveloped real estate in San Francisco, California, including entitlements and improvements associated with the land, which we plan to develop into our global headquarters. We may not realize the anticipated benefits with respect to the purchase and future development of such real estate. We have devoted significant capital resources to the purchase, and we will be required to devote substantial additional resources in the future to building our global headquarters on such land, which may impact our liquidity and financial flexibility. We may not be able to obtain financing for development projects on favorable terms, or at all, or complete construction on schedule or within budget. Any delay or lack of available financing could result in increased constructions costs and debt costs to fund such construction and development. In addition, our development efforts will otherwise be subject to various operational risks. We may not be able to obtain, or may experience delays in obtaining, all necessary zoning, land-use, building, occupancy and other governmental permits and authorizations. The construction costs and total investment amounts may exceed any estimates that we formulate, and projects may not be completed, or delivered as planned. Finally, real estate assets are not as liquid as certain other types of assets. In the event that we have a future need to sell this property, we may not be able to do so on favorable terms or at all. Sales to customers outside the United States expose us to risks inherent in international sales. Because we sell our service throughout the world, we are subject to risks and challenges that we would otherwise not face if we conducted our business only in the United States. For example, sales in Europe and Asia Pacific together represented approximately 30 percent of our total revenues for the year ended January 31, 2011, and we intend to continue to expand our international sales efforts. The risks and challenges associated with sales to customers outside the United States include:  ##TABLE_START    localization of our service, including translation into foreign languages and associated expenses; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    laws and business practices favoring local competitors; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    compliance with multiple, conflicting and changing governmental laws and regulations, including employment, tax, privacy and data protection laws and regulations; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    treatment of revenue from international sources and changes to tax codes, including being subject to foreign tax laws and being liable for paying withholding income or other taxes in foreign jurisdictions; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    regional data privacy laws that apply to the transmission of our customers data across international borders; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    foreign currency fluctuations and controls; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    different pricing environments; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    different or lesser protection of our intellectual property; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    longer accounts receivable payment cycles and other collection difficulties; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    regional economic conditions; and ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    regional political conditions. ##TABLE_END Any of these factors could negatively impact our business and results of operations. Additionally, our international subscription fees are paid either in U.S. dollars or local currency. As a result, fluctuations in the value of the U.S. dollar and foreign currencies may make our service more expensive for international customers, which could harm our business. From time to time, we may become defendants in legal proceedings about which we are unable to assess our exposure and which could become significant liabilities upon judgment. We may become defendants in legal proceedings from time to time. Companies in our industry have been subject to claims related to patent infringement and product liability, as well as contract and employment-related claims. We may not be able to accurately assess the risk related to these suits, and we may be unable to accurately assess our level of exposure. Privacy concerns and laws, evolving regulation of the Internet and other domestic or foreign regulations may reduce the effectiveness of our solution and adversely affect our business. As Internet commerce continues to evolve, increasing regulation by federal, state or foreign agencies becomes more likely. For example, we believe increased regulation is likely in the area of data privacy, and laws and regulations applying to the solicitation, collection, processing or use of personal or consumer information could affect our customers ability to use and share data, potentially reducing demand for CRM solutions and restricting our ability to store, process and share data with our customers. Our customers can use our service to store contact and other personal or identifying information regarding their customers and contacts. Federal, state and foreign government bodies and agencies have adopted or are considering adopting laws and regulations regarding the collection, use and disclosure of personal information obtained from consumers and individuals. The costs of compliance with, and other burdens imposed by, such laws and regulations that are applicable to the businesses of our customers may limit the use and adoption of our service and reduce overall demand for it, or lead to significant fines, penalties or liabilities for any noncompliance with such privacy laws. Furthermore, privacy concerns may cause our customers customers to resist providing the personal data necessary to allow our customers to use our service effectively. Even the perception of privacy concerns, whether or not valid, may inhibit market adoption of our service in certain industries.  For example, in the United States regulations such as the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, which protects and restricts the use of consumer credit and financial information, and the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, which regulates the use and disclosure of personal health information, impose significant requirements and obligations on businesses that may affect the use and adoption of our service. The European Union has also adopted a data privacy directive that requires member states to impose restrictions on the collection and use of personal data that, in some respects, are more stringent, and impose more significant burdens on subject businesses, than current privacy standards in the United States. All of these domestic and international legislative and regulatory initiatives may adversely affect our customers ability to collect and/or use demographic and personal information from their customers, which could reduce demand for our service. Many other jurisdictions have similar stringent privacy laws and regulations. In addition to government activity, privacy advocacy groups and the technology and other industries are considering various new, additional or different self-regulatory standards that may place additional burdens on us. If the gathering of personal information were to be curtailed in this manner, CRM solutions would be less effective, which may reduce demand for our service and harm our business. We may lose key members of our management team and development and operations personnel, or may be unable to attract and retain employees we need to support our operations and growth. Our success depends substantially upon the continued services of our executive officers and other key members of management, particularly our Chief Executive Officer. From time to time, there may be changes in our executive management team resulting from the hiring or departure of executives. Such changes in our executive management team may be disruptive to our business. We are also substantially dependent on the continued service of our existing development and operations personnel because of the complexity of our service and technologies. We do not have employment agreements with any of our executive officers, key management, development or operations personnel and, therefore, they could terminate their employment with us at any time. The loss of one or more of our key employees or groups could seriously harm our business. In the technology industry, there is substantial and continuous competition for engineers with high levels of experience in designing, developing and managing software and Internet-related services, as well as competition for sales executives and operations personnel. We may not be successful in attracting and retaining qualified personnel. We have from time to time experienced, and we expect to continue to experience, difficulty in hiring and retaining highly skilled employees with appropriate qualifications. If we fail to attract new personnel or fail to retain and motivate our current personnel, our business and future growth prospects could be severely harmed. Unanticipated changes in our effective tax rate could adversely affect our future results. We are subject to income taxes in the United States and various foreign jurisdictions, and our domestic and international tax liabilities are subject to the allocation of expenses in differing jurisdictions. Our effective tax rate could be adversely affected by changes in the mix of earnings and losses in countries with differing statutory tax rates, certain non-deductible expenses as a result of acquisitions, the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities and changes in federal, state or international tax laws and accounting principles. Increases in our effective tax rate could materially affect our net results. In addition, we are subject to income tax audits by many tax jurisdictions throughout the world. Although we believe our income tax liabilities are reasonably estimated and accounted for in accordance with applicable laws and principles, an adverse resolution of one or more uncertain tax positions in any period could have a material impact on the results of operations for that period.  Natural disasters and other events beyond our control could materially adversely affect us. Natural disasters or other catastrophic events may cause damage or disruption to our operations, international commerce and the global economy, and thus could have a strong negative effect on us. Our business operations are subject to interruption by natural disasters, fire, power shortages, pandemics and other events beyond our control. Although we maintain crisis management and disaster response plans, such events could make it difficult or impossible for us to deliver our services to our customers, and could decrease demand for our services. The majority of our research and development activities, corporate headquarters, information technology systems, and other critical business operations, are located near major seismic faults in the San Francisco Bay Area. Because we do not carry earthquake insurance for direct quake-related losses, and significant recovery time could be required to resume operations, our financial condition and operating results could be materially adversely affected in the event of a major earthquake or catastrophic event. Risks Relating to Ownership of Our Common Stock and our Convertible Senior Notes due 2015 The market price of our common stock is likely to be volatile and could subject us to litigation. The trading prices of the securities of technology companies have been highly volatile. Accordingly, the market price of our common stock has been and is likely to continue to be subject to wide fluctuations. Factors affecting the market price of our common stock include: ##TABLE_START    variations in our operating results, earnings per share, cash flows from operating activities, deferred revenue, and other financial metrics and non-financial metrics, and how those results compare to analyst expectations; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    forward looking guidance to industry and financial analysts related to future revenue and earnings per share; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    the net increases in the number of customers, either independently or as compared with published expectations of industry, financial or other analysts that cover our company; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    changes in the estimates of our operating results or changes in recommendations by securities analysts that elect to follow our common stock; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    announcements of technological innovations, new services or service enhancements, strategic alliances or significant agreements by us or by our competitors; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    announcements by us or by our competitors of mergers or other strategic acquisitions, or rumors of such transactions involving us or our competitors; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    announcements of customer additions and customer cancellations or delays in customer purchases; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    recruitment or departure of key personnel; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    disruptions in our service due to computer hardware, software or network problems; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    the economy as a whole, market conditions in our industry, and the industries of our customers; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    trading activity by a limited number of stockholders who together beneficially own a majority of our outstanding common stock; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    the issuance of shares of common stock by us, whether in connection with an acquisition, a capital raising transaction or upon conversion of some or all of our outstanding $575.0 million of 0.75% convertible senior notes due January 15, 2015 (the Notes); and ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    any other factors discussed herein. ##TABLE_END In addition, if the market for technology stocks or the stock market in general experiences uneven investor confidence, the market price of our common stock could decline for reasons unrelated to our business, operating  results or financial condition. The market price of our common stock might also decline in reaction to events that affect other companies within, or outside, our industry even if these events do not directly affect us. Some companies that have experienced volatility in the trading price of their stock have been the subject of securities class action litigation. If we are the subject of such litigation, it could result in substantial costs and a diversion of managements attention and resources. Provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws, Delaware law and our outstanding Notes might discourage, delay or prevent a change of control of our company or changes in our management and, therefore, depress the market price of our common stock. Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that could depress the market price of our common stock by acting to discourage, delay or prevent a change in control of our company or changes in our management that the stockholders of our company may deem advantageous. These provisions among other things: ##TABLE_START    establish a classified board of directors so that not all members of our board are elected at one time; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    permit the board of directors to establish the number of directors; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    provide that directors may only be removed for cause and only with the approval of 66 2/3 percent of our stockholders; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    require super-majority voting to amend some provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    authorize the issuance of blank check preferred stock that our board could use to implement a stockholder rights plan (also known as a poison pill); ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    eliminate the ability of our stockholders to call special meetings of stockholders; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    prohibit stockholder action by written consent, which requires all stockholder actions to be taken at a meeting of our stockholders; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    provide that the board of directors is expressly authorized to make, alter or repeal our bylaws; and ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    establish advance notice requirements for nominations for election to our board or for proposing matters that can be acted upon by stockholders at annual stockholder meetings. ##TABLE_END In addition, Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law may discourage, delay or prevent a change in control of our company. Section 203 imposes certain restrictions on merger, business combinations and other transactions between us and holders of 15 percent or more of our common stock. In addition, the fundamental change purchase rights applicable to our convertible notes, which will allow note holders to require us to purchase all or a portion of their Notes upon the occurrence of a fundamental change, and the provisions requiring an increase to the conversion rate for conversions in connection with a make-whole fundamental change may in certain circumstances delay or prevent a takeover of us and the removal of incumbent management that might otherwise be beneficial to investors. Our debt service obligations may adversely affect our financial condition and cash flows from operations. As a result of our sale of the Notes in January 2010, we have a higher level of debt compared to historical periods. Our maintenance of this indebtedness could have important consequences because: ##TABLE_START    it may impair our ability to obtain additional financing in the future; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    an increased portion of our cash flows from operations may have to be dedicated towards repaying the principal in 2015 or earlier if necessary; and ##TABLE_END  ##TABLE_START    it may make us more vulnerable to downturns in our business, our industry or the economy in general. ##TABLE_END Our ability to meet our expenses and debt obligations will depend on our future performance, which will be affected by financial, business, economic, regulatory and other factors. We will not be able to control many of these factors, such as economic conditions and governmental regulations. Our operations may not generate sufficient cash to enable us to service our debt. If we fail to make a payment on our debt, we could be in default on such debt. The trading price of the Notes may be significantly affected by the market price of our common stock, which may be volatile, the general level of interest rates and our credit quality. Because the Notes are convertible into cash equal to the principal amount of the Notes, and at our election, cash and/or shares of the Companys common stock for any amounts in excess of the principal amounts, the market price of our common stock may significantly affect the trading price of the Notes. See  The market price of our common stock is likely to be volatile and could subject us to litigation  above. In addition, the general level of interest rates and our credit quality may significantly affect the trading price of the Notes. We also cannot predict whether interest rates will rise or fall. During the term of the Notes, interest rates will be influenced by a number of factors, most of which are beyond our control. However, if interest rates increase, the option value of the Notes convertibility feature will increase, but the yield of the Notes will decrease, and if interest rates decrease, the option value of the Notes convertibility feature will decrease, but the yield of the notes will increase. In addition, our credit quality may vary substantially during the term of the Notes and will be influenced by a number of factors, including variations in our cash flows and the amount of indebtedness we have outstanding. Any decrease in our credit quality could negatively impact the trading price of the Notes. The convertible note hedge and warrant transactions may affect the trading price of the Notes and the market price of our common stock. We entered into privately negotiated convertible note hedge transactions with the hedge counterparties concurrently with the issuance of the Notes. We also entered into privately negotiated warrant transactions with the hedge counterparties. Taken together, the convertible note hedge transactions and the warrant transactions are expected, but not guaranteed, to reduce the potential dilution with respect to our common stock upon conversion of the Notes. As the hedge counterparties and their respective affiliates modify their hedge positions from time to time by entering into or unwinding various over-the-counter derivative transactions with respect to our common stock, and/or by purchasing or selling shares of our common stock or the Notes in privately negotiated transactions and/or open market transactions, their activities could adversely affect the market price of our common stock and the trading price of the Notes. In addition, the hedge counterparties are financial institutions or affiliates of financial institutions, and we will be subject to the risk that these hedge counterparties may default under the convertible note hedge transactions. ##TABLE_START ", "1B": " ITEM 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS ##TABLE_END None.  ##TABLE_START ", "2": " ITEM 2. PROPERTIES ##TABLE_END Our executive offices and principal office for domestic marketing, sales, professional services and development occupy over 625,000 square feet in the San Francisco Bay Area under leases that expire at various times through July 2020. We also lease space in various locations throughout the United States for local sales and professional services personnel. Our foreign subsidiaries lease office space for their operations including local sales and professional services personnel. In November 2010, we purchased approximately 14 acres of undeveloped land in San Francisco, California including entitlements and improvements associated with the land, and perpetual parking rights in an existing garage. We plan to use the land to build a facility that will become our new global headquarters. We believe that our existing facilities and offices are adequate to meet our current requirements. See Note 8, Commitments, in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information about our lease commitments. If we require additional space, we believe that we will be able to obtain such space on acceptable, commercially reasonable terms. ##TABLE_START ", "3": " ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS ##TABLE_END We are involved in various legal proceedings arising from the normal course of business activities, including claims of alleged infringement of third-party patents and other intellectual property rights, commercial, employment and other matters. We make a provision for a liability relating to legal proceedings when it is both probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. These provisions are reviewed at least quarterly and adjusted to reflect the impacts of negotiations, settlements, rulings, advice of legal counsel and other information and events pertaining to a particular case. In managements opinion, resolution of these matters is not expected to have a material adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations, cash flows or financial position. However, depending on the nature and timing of any such dispute, an unfavorable resolution of a matter could materially affect our future results of operations or cash flows or both. Many of our subscription agreements require us to indemnify our customers for third-party intellectual property infringement claims, which could increase the cost to us of an adverse ruling on such a claim. Any adverse determination related to intellectual property claims or litigation could prevent us from offering our service to others, could be material to our net income or cash flows or both or could otherwise adversely affect our operating results. ##TABLE_START ", "4": "", "5": " ITEM 5.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS ##TABLE_END The following discussion contains forward-looking statements, including, without limitation, our expectations and statements regarding our outlook and future revenues, expenses, results of operations, liquidity, plans, strategies and objectives of management and any assumptions underlying any of the foregoing. Our actual results may differ significantly from those projected in the forward-looking statements. Factors that might cause future actual results to differ materially from our recent results or those projected in the forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, those discussed in the section titled of this Annual Report on Form 10-K Risk Factors. Except as required by law, we assume no obligation to update the forward-looking statements or our risk factors for any reason. Overview We are a leading provider of enterprise cloud computing applications. We provide a comprehensive customer and collaboration relationship management, or CRM, service to businesses of all sizes and industries worldwide and we provide a technology platform for customers and developers to build and run business applications. We were founded in February 1999 and began offering our enterprise CRM application service in February 2000. Since then, we have augmented our CRM service with new editions and enhanced features. We introduced our Force.com platform to customers and developers so they can build complementary applications to extend beyond CRM. In 2010 we introduced our AppExchange directory of enterprise cloud computing applications that are integrated with our CRM service and in most cases have been developed on our platform by third parties. We also introduced Chatter, a collaboration application for the enterprise to connect and share information securely and in real-time. Our objective is to be the leading provider of CRM application services and to be the leading platform on which our customers and partners build cloud computing applications. Key elements of our strategy include: ##TABLE_START    Strengthening our existing CRM applications and extending into new functional areas within CRM; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    Pursuing new customers and new territories aggressively; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    Deepening relationships with our existing customer base; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    Continuing to lead the industry transformation to the next phase of cloud computing; and ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    Encouraging the development of third-party applications on our Force.com cloud computing platform. ##TABLE_END We believe the factors that will influence our ability to achieve our objectives include our prospective customers willingness to migrate to an enterprise cloud computing application service; the performance and security of our service; our ability to continue to release, and gain customer acceptance of, new and improved features; our ability to successfully integrate acquired businesses and technologies; successful customer adoption and utilization of our service; acceptance of our service in markets where we have few customers; the emergence of additional competitors in our market and improved product offerings by existing and new competitors; the location of new data centers; third-party developers willingness to develop applications on our platform; and general economic conditions which could affect our customers ability and willingness to purchase our application service, delay the customers purchasing decision or affect renewal rates. To address these factors, we will need to, among other things, continue to add substantial numbers of paying subscriptions, upgrade our customers to fully featured versions such as our Unlimited Edition, provide high quality technical support to our customers and encourage the development of third-party applications on our Force.com platform. We plan to invest for future growth by expanding our data center capacity. We also plan to hire additional personnel, particularly in direct sales, other customer-related areas and research and development. As part of our growth plans, we intend to continue focus on retaining customers at the time of renewal.  Additionally, we plan to: expand our domestic and international selling and marketing activities; continue to develop our brands; add additional distribution channels; increase our research and development activities to upgrade and extend our service offerings; develop new services and technologies and integrate acquired technologies; and add to our global infrastructure to support our growth. We also regularly evaluate acquisitions or investment opportunities in complementary businesses, joint ventures, services and technologies in an effort to expand our service offerings. We expect to continue to make such investments and acquisitions in the future. As such, we plan to reinvest a significant portion of our incremental revenue in fiscal 2012 to grow our business and continue our leadership role in the cloud computing industry. We expect diluted earnings per share for fiscal 2012 to be significantly lower than diluted earnings per share for fiscal 2011. In November 2010, we paid $278.0 million in cash for approximately 14 acres of undeveloped real estate in San Francisco, California, including entitlements and improvements associated with the land, and perpetual parking rights in an existing garage, which we plan to develop into our global headquarters. During fiscal 2011 we acquired several companies to strengthen and extend our service offerings. We spent approximately $403.3 million, net of cash acquired, for these companies. In December 2000, we established a Japanese joint venture, Kabushiki Kaisha salesforce.com (Salesforce Japan), with SunBridge, Inc., a Japanese corporation, to assist with our sales efforts in Japan. During fiscal 2011, we acquired SunBridges and other shareholders interest in, and increased our ownership from 72 percent to 100 percent of, Salesforce Japan for cash payments totaling $172.0 million. In fiscal 2010, we issued at par $575.0 million 0.75% convertible senior notes (notes) due on January 15, 2015. For 20 trading days during the 30 consecutive trading days ended January 31, 2011, our common stock traded at a price exceeding 130% of the conversion price of $85.36 per share applicable to the Notes. Accordingly, based on the terms of the Notes, the Notes are convertible at the holders option for the quarter ending April 30, 2011. Upon conversion of any Notes, we will deliver cash up to the principal amount of the Notes and, with respect to any excess conversion value greater than the principal amount of the Notes, shares of our common stock, cash, or a combination of both. Therefore, for the quarter ending April 30, 2011, the Notes will be reclassified to a current liability on our consolidated balance sheet. We expect marketing and sales costs, which were 48 percent of our total revenues for fiscal 2011 and 46 percent for the same period a year ago, to continue to represent a substantial portion of total revenues in the future as we seek to add and manage more paying subscribers, and build greater brand awareness. Fiscal Year Our fiscal year ends on January 31. References to fiscal 2011, for example, refer to the fiscal year ended January 31, 2011. Sources of Revenues We derive our revenues from two sources: (1) subscription revenues, which are comprised of subscription fees from customers accessing our enterprise cloud computing application service, and from customers purchasing additional support beyond the standard support that is included in the basic subscription fee; and (2) related professional services and other revenues consisting primarily of training fees. Subscription and support revenues accounted for approximately 94 percent of our total revenues during fiscal 2011. Subscription revenues are driven primarily by the number of paying subscribers of our service, varying service types of offering and the subscription price of our service. We define a customer as a separate and distinct buying entity (e.g., a company, a distinct business unit of a large corporation, a partnership, etc.) that has entered into a contract to access our enterprise cloud computing service. We define a subscription as a unique user account purchased by a customer for use by its employees or other customer-authorized users, and each such user is who we call a subscriber. The number of paying subscriptions at each of our customers ranges from one to tens of thousands. None of our customers accounted for more than 5 percent of our revenues during fiscal 2011, 2010, or 2009.  Subscription and support revenues are recognized ratably over the contract terms beginning on the commencement dates of each contract. The typical subscription and support term is 12 to 24 months, although terms range from one to 60 months. Our subscription and support contracts are non-cancelable, though customers typically have the right to terminate their contracts for cause if we materially fail to perform. We generally invoice our customers in advance, in annual or quarterly installments, and typical payment terms provide that our customers pay us within 30 days of invoice. Amounts that have been invoiced are recorded in accounts receivable and in deferred revenue, or in revenue depending on whether the revenue recognition criteria have been met. In general, we collect our billings in advance of the subscription service period. Professional services and other revenues consist of fees associated with consulting and implementation services and training. Our consulting and implementation engagements are typically billed on a time and materials basis. We also offer a number of classes on implementing, using and administering our service that are billed on a per person, per class basis. Our typical payment terms provide that our customers pay us within 30 days of invoice. We generally recognize revenue ratably over the contract terms beginning on the commencement date of each contract. In determining whether professional services can be accounted for separately from subscription and support revenues, we consider a number of factors, which are described in Critical Accounting Policies and EstimatesRevenue Recognition below. As we introduce new service offerings, we may not be able to establish objective and reliable evidence of fair value for these elements of our sales arrangements. As a result, when the professional services are sold together with subscription services that do not have objective and reliable evidence of fair value, the professional services fees cannot be accounted for separately, and the entire arrangement is accounted for as a single unit of accounting. In such situations, we recognize the entire arrangement fee ratably over the term of the subscription contract. Approximately 6 percent of our total deferred revenue as of January 31, 2011 and 2010 respectively, related to deferred professional services revenue. At the start of fiscal 2012 we will be adopting the provisions of ASU 2009-13. Adopting this provision will change our accounting for multiple-element arrangements, see Recent Accounting Pronouncement. Seasonal Nature of Deferred Revenue and Accounts Receivable Deferred revenue primarily consists of billings to customers for our subscription service. Over 90 percent of the value of our billings to customers is for our subscription and support service. We generally invoice our customers in either quarterly or annual cycles, with a disproportionate weighting towards annual billings in the fourth quarter, primarily as a result of large enterprise account buying patterns. Additionally, our fourth quarter has historically been our strongest quarter for new business. The year on year compounding effect of this seasonality in both billing patterns and overall new business is causing the value of invoices that we generate in the fourth quarter for both new and existing customers to increase as a proportion of our total annual billings.  Accordingly, the sequential quarterly changes in accounts receivable and the related deferred revenue during the first three quarters of our fiscal year are not necessarily indicative of the billing activity that occurs in the fourth quarter. ##TABLE_START (in thousands)  April 30, 2010   July 31, 2010   October 31, 2010   January 31, 2011  Fiscal 2011     Accounts receivable, net  $ 183,612   $ 228,550   $ 258,764   $ 426,943  Deferred revenue, current and noncurrent   664,529    683,019    694,557    934,941    April 30, 2009   July 31, 2009   October 31, 2009   January 31, 2010  Fiscal 2010     Accounts receivable, net  $ 145,869   $ 168,842   $ 191,297   $ 320,956  Deferred revenue, current and noncurrent   549,373    549,010    545,435    704,348    April 30, 2008   July 31, 2008   October 31, 2008   January 31, 2009  Fiscal 2009     Accounts receivable, net  $ 143,909   $ 146,982   $ 157,680   $ 266,555  Deferred revenue, current and noncurrent   470,297    479,546    469,534    594,026  ##TABLE_END Cost of Revenues and Operating Expenses Cost of Revenues. Cost of subscription and support revenues primarily consists of expenses related to hosting our service and providing support, the costs of data center capacity, depreciation or operating lease expense associated with computer equipment, allocated overhead and amortization expense associated with capitalized software related to our application service and acquired technology. We allocate overhead such as rent and occupancy charges based on headcount. Employee benefit costs and taxes are allocated based upon a percentage of total compensation expense. As such, general overhead expenses are reflected in each cost of revenue and operating expense category. Cost of professional services and other revenues consists primarily of employee-related costs associated with these services, including stock-based expenses, the cost of subcontractors and allocated overhead. The cost of providing professional services is significantly higher as a percentage of revenue than for our enterprise cloud computing subscription service due to the direct labor costs and costs of subcontractors. We intend to continue to invest additional resources in our enterprise cloud computing application service. For example, we plan to open additional data centers in the future. Additionally, as we acquire new businesses and technologies, the amortization expense associated with this activity will be included in cost of revenues. The timing of these additional expenses will affect our cost of revenues, both in terms of absolute dollars and as a percentage of revenues, in the affected periods. Research and Development . Research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries and related expenses, including stock-based expenses, the costs of our development and test data center and allocated overhead. We continue to focus our research and development efforts on adding new features and services, integrating acquired technologies, increasing the functionality and enhancing the ease of use of our enterprise cloud computing application service. Our proprietary, scalable and secure multi-tenant architecture enables us to provide all of our customers with a service based on a single version of our application. As a result, we do not have to maintain multiple versions, which enables us to have relatively lower research and development expenses as compared to traditional enterprise software companies. We expect that in the future, research and development expenses will increase in absolute dollars as we upgrade and extend our service offerings, develop new technologies and integrate acquired businesses and technologies.  Marketing and Sales. Marketing and sales expenses are our largest cost and consist primarily of salaries and related expenses, including stock-based expenses, for our sales and marketing staff, including commissions, payments to partners, marketing programs and allocated overhead. Marketing programs consist of advertising, events, corporate communications and brand building and product marketing activities. We plan to continue to invest in marketing and sales by expanding our domestic and international selling and marketing activities, building brand awareness and sponsoring additional marketing events. We expect that in the future, marketing and sales expenses will increase in absolute dollars and continue to be our largest cost. General and Administrative. General and administrative expenses consist of salaries and related expenses, including stock-based expenses, for finance and accounting, human resources and management information systems personnel, legal costs, professional fees, other corporate expenses and allocated overhead. We expect that in the future, general and administrative expenses will increase in absolute dollars as we invest in our infrastructure and we incur additional employee related costs, professional fees and insurance costs related to the growth of our business and international expansion. We expect general and administrative costs as a percentage of total revenues to remain flat for the next several quarters. Stock-Based Expenses. Our cost of revenues and operating expenses include stock-based expenses related to option and stock awards to employees and non-employee directors. We recognize our share-based payments as an expense in the statement of operations based on their fair values and vesting periods. If our grant activity remains consistent and our stock price increases in the future, stock-based expenses will rise. These charges have been significant in the past and we expect that they will increase as we hire more employees and seek to retain existing employees. Joint Venture In December 2000, we established a Japanese joint venture, Kabushiki Kaisha salesforce.com (Salesforce Japan), with SunBridge, Inc., a Japanese corporation, to assist us with our sales efforts in Japan. During fiscal 2011, we acquired SunBridges and other shareholders interest in, and increased our ownership from 72 percent to 100 percent of, Salesforce Japan. As a result of our purchase of the shares held by SunBridge, the joint venture agreement terminated according to its terms. As we did not obtain 100 percent ownership until the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011, we recorded a noncontrolling interest in our consolidated statement of operations for fiscal 2011, which reflects the interest that we did not control in Salesforce Japans results in fiscal 2011 and all prior years presented. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, costs and expenses, and related disclosures. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates and assumptions. Our actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. We believe that of our significant accounting policies, which are described in note 1 to our consolidated financial statements, the following accounting policies involve a greater degree of judgment and complexity. Accordingly, these are the policies we believe are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our consolidated financial condition and results of operations. Revenue Recognition . We recognize revenue when all of the following conditions are satisfied: (1) there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement; (2) the service has been provided to the customer; (3) the collection of our fees is reasonably assured; and (4) the amount of fees to be paid by the customer is fixed or determinable. Our arrangements do not contain general rights of return.  We recognize subscription revenues ratably over the contract terms beginning on the commencement dates of each contract. Support revenues from customers who purchase our premium support offerings are recognized similarly over the term of the support contract. As part of their subscription agreements, customers generally benefit from new features and functionality with each release at no additional cost. In situations where we have contractually committed to an individual customer specific technology, we defer all of the revenue for that customer until the technology is delivered and accepted. Once delivery occurs, we then recognize the revenue over the remaining contract term. Consulting services and training revenues are accounted for separately from subscription and support revenues when these services have value to the customer on a standalone basis and there is objective and reliable evidence of fair value of each deliverable. When accounted for separately, revenues are recognized as the services are rendered for time and material contracts, and when the milestones are achieved and accepted by the customer for fixed price contracts. The majority of our consulting service contracts are on a time and material basis. Training revenues are recognized after the services are performed. For revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables, such as an arrangement that includes subscription, premium support, consulting or training services, we allocate the total amount the customer will pay to the separate units of accounting based on their relative fair values, as determined by the price of the undelivered items when sold separately. In determining whether the consulting services can be accounted for separately from subscription and support revenues, we consider the following factors for each consulting agreement: availability of the consulting services from other vendors, whether objective and reliable evidence of fair value exists for the undelivered elements, the nature of the consulting services, the timing of when the consulting contract was signed in comparison to the subscription service start date, and the contractual dependence of the subscription service on the customers satisfaction with the consulting work. If a consulting arrangement does not qualify for separate accounting, we recognize the consulting revenue ratably over the remaining term of the subscription contract. Additionally, in these situations we defer the direct costs of the consulting arrangement and amortize those costs over the same time period as the consulting revenue is recognized. The deferred cost on our consolidated balance sheet totaled $28.1 million at January 31, 2011 and $19.1 million at January 31, 2010. Such amounts are included in prepaid expenses and other current assets and other assets, net. Accounting for Deferred Commissions. We defer commission payments to our direct sales force. The commissions are deferred and amortized to sales expense over the non-cancelable terms of the related subscription contracts with our customers, which are typically 12 to 24 months. The commission payments, which are paid in full the month after the customers service commences, are a direct and incremental cost of the revenue arrangements. The deferred commission amounts are recoverable through the future revenue streams under the non-cancelable customer contracts. We believe this is the preferable method of accounting as the commission charges are so closely related to the revenue from the non-cancelable customer contracts that they should be recorded as an asset and charged to expense over the same period that the subscription revenue is recognized. During fiscal 2011, we deferred $121.2 million of commission expenditures and we amortized $80.2 million to sales expense. During the same period a year ago, we deferred $82.3 million of commission expenditures and we amortized $63.9 million to sales expense. Deferred commissions on our consolidated balance sheet totaled $116.6 million at January 31, 2011 and $75.5 million at January 31, 2010. Business Combinations. We recognize separately from goodwill the fair value of assets acquired and the liabilities assumed. Goodwill as of the acquisition date is measured as the excess of consideration transferred and the net of the acquisition date fair values of the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed. We use the best estimates and assumptions as a part of the purchase price allocation process to accurately value assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date. Our estimates are inherently uncertain and subject to refinement. As a result, during the measurement period, which may be up to one year from the acquisition date, we may record adjustments to the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed, with the corresponding offset to  goodwill. Upon the conclusion of the measurement period or final determination of the fair value of assets acquired or liabilities assumed, whichever comes first, any subsequent adjustments are recorded to our consolidated statements of operations. In addition, uncertain tax positions and tax related valuation allowances assumed in connection with a business combination are initially estimated as of the acquisition date. We reevaluate these items quarterly and record any adjustments to the preliminary estimates to goodwill provided that we are within the measurement period and we continue to collect information in order to determine their estimated fair values as of the date of acquisition. Subsequent to the measurement period or our final determination of the tax allowances or contingencys estimated value, changes to these uncertain tax positions and tax related valuation allowances will affect our provision for income taxes in the consolidated statement of operations. Accounting for Stock-Based Awards. We recognize the fair value of our stock awards on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period of the award which is the vesting term of four years. We recognized stock-based expense of $120.4 million, or 7 percent of revenue, during fiscal 2011. The requirement to expense stock-based awards will continue to materially reduce our reported results of operations. As of January 31, 2011, we had an aggregate of $559.8 million of stock compensation remaining to be amortized to expense over the remaining requisite service period of the underlying awards. We currently expect this stock compensation balance to be amortized as follows: $195.1 million during fiscal 2012; $157.9 million during fiscal 2013; $129.6 million during fiscal 2014; $76.8 million during fiscal 2015 and $0.4 million during fiscal 2016. These amounts reflect only outstanding stock awards as of January 31, 2011 and assume no forfeiture activity. We expect to continue to issue share-based awards to our employees in future periods, which will increase the stock compensation amortization in such future periods. We recognize as an operating expense the payroll and social tax costs, as applicable by jurisdiction, when stock options are exercised. The impact of stock-based expense in the future is dependent upon, among other things, the timing of when we hire additional employees, the effect of long-term incentive strategies involving stock awards in order to continue to attract and retain employees, the total number of stock awards granted, the fair value of the stock awards at the time of grant, changes in estimated forfeiture assumption rates and the tax benefit that we may or may not receive from stock-based expenses. Additionally, we are required to use an option-pricing model to determine the fair value of stock option awards. This determination of fair value is affected by our stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of highly complex and subjective variables. These variables include, but are not limited to, our expected stock price volatility over the term of the awards. As of January 31, 2011, there were 3.2 million restricted stock awards and units outstanding. We plan to continue awarding restricted stock to our employees in the future. The restricted stock, which upon vesting entitles the holder to one share of common stock for each restricted stock, has an exercise price of $0.001 per share, which is equal to the par value of our common stock, and vest over 4 years. The fair value of the restricted stock is based on our closing stock price on the date of grant, and compensation expense, net of estimated forfeitures, is recognized on a straight-line basis over the vesting period. Accounting for Income Taxes. We account for income taxes using the liability method, which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets or liabilities for the tax-effected temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of our assets and liabilities and for net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. The tax expense or benefit for unusual items, or certain adjustments to the valuation allowance are treated as discrete items in the interim period in which the events occur. Our effective tax rate could be adversely affected by changes in the mix of earnings and losses in countries with differing statutory tax rates, certain non-deductible expenses as a result of acquisitions, the calculation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, and changes in tax laws and accounting principles.

Subscription and support revenues were $1.6 billion, or 94 percent of total revenues, for fiscal 2011, compared to $1.2 billion, or 93 percent of total revenues, during the same period a year ago. The increase in subscription and support revenues was due primarily to new customers, upgrades and additional subscriptions from existing customers and improved renewal rates as compared to a year ago. The price per user per month for our three primary offerings, Professional Edition, Enterprise Edition and Unlimited Edition, in fiscal 2011 has remained substantially consistent relative to fiscal 2010. Professional services and other revenues were $106.0 million, or 6 percent of total revenues, for fiscal 2011, compared to $96.1 million, or 7 percent of total revenues, for the same period a year ago. The increase in professional services and other revenues was due primarily to the higher demand for services from an increased number of customers. Revenues in Europe and Asia Pacific accounted for $522.1 million, or 32 percent of total revenues, for fiscal 2011, compared to $381.8 million, or 29 percent of total revenues, during the same period a year ago, an increase of $140.3 million, or 37 percent. The increase in revenues outside of the Americas was the result of the increasing acceptance of our service, and our focus on marketing our service internationally. Additionally, the value of the U.S. dollar relative to foreign currencies contributed to a slight decrease in U.S. dollar revenues outside of the Americas for fiscal 2011 as compared to the same period a year ago. The foreign currency impact had the effect of reducing our aggregate revenues by $7.6 million compared to the same period a year ago. As part of our overall growth, we expect the percentage of our revenue generated outside of the Americas to continue to increase as a percentage of our total revenues world wide.  Cost of Revenues. ##TABLE_START   Fiscal Year Ended January 31,   Variance Dollars  (In thousands)  2011   2010   Subscription and support  $ 208,243   $ 159,172   $ 49,071  Professional services and other   115,570    98,753    16,817              Total cost of revenues  $ 323,813   $ 257,925   $ 65,888              Percent of total revenues   20 %   20 %  ##TABLE_END Cost of revenues was $323.8 million, or 20 percent of total revenues, during fiscal 2011, compared to $257.9 million, or 20 percent of total revenues, during the same period a year ago, an increase of $65.9 million. The increase in absolute dollars was primarily due to an increase of $22.6 million in employee-related costs, an increase of $9.2 million in service delivery costs, primarily due to our efforts in increasing data center capacity, an increase of $16.6 million in depreciation and amortization expenses, an increase of $13.2 million in outside subcontractor and other service costs, and an increase of $3.6 million in allocated overhead, offset by a decrease of $0.4 million in stock based expenses. The cost of professional services and other revenues exceeded the related revenue during fiscal 2011 by $9.6 million as compared to $2.6 million during fiscal 2010, primarily due to an increase in the cost related to professional services headcount. We intend to continue to invest additional resources in our enterprise cloud computing application service. The timing of these additional expenses, will affect our cost of revenues, both in terms of absolute dollars and as a percentage of revenues in future periods. We expect the cost of professional services to continue to exceed revenue from professional services during fiscal 2012. We believe that this investment in professional services facilitates the adoption of our application service.

The increase in absolute dollars was due to an increase of $42.0 million in employee-related costs, an increase of $5.8 million in stock-based expenses, and an increase of $5.6 million in allocated overhead. We increased our research and development headcount by 47 percent since January 31, 2010 in order to upgrade and extend our service offerings and develop new technologies. Some of the increase in headcount was due to acquired businesses.

The increase in absolute dollars was primarily due to increases of $143.1 million in employee-related costs, $16.7 million in stock-based expenses, $12.1 million in advertising costs and marketing and event costs, $1.0 million in depreciation and amortization, and $12.6 million in allocated overhead. Our marketing and sales headcount increased by 34 percent since January 31, 2010 as we hired additional sales personnel to focus on adding new customers and increasing penetration within our existing customer base.

The increase was primarily due to increases of $46.8 million in employee-related costs, $9.5 million in stock-based expenses, and increases in depreciation and amortization, service delivery costs, and professional and outside service costs. Our general and administrative headcount increased by 30 percent since January 31, 2010 as we added personnel to support our growth.

Interest expense was $24.9 million, net of interest costs capitalized, during fiscal 2011 and was $2.0 million during the same period a year ago. The increase was primarily due to interest expense associated with the January 2010 issuance of $575.0 million of convertible senior notes and capital leases associated with equipment acquired to expand our data center capacity. During fiscal 2011, we capitalized $4.0 million of interest costs related to major construction projects, specifically our campus project and our capitalized internal-use software development costs. We will continue to capitalize interest on these projects until these assets are ready for service.

Our effective tax rate decreased to 33 percent for fiscal 2011 compared to 41 percent for the same period a year ago. The decrease was due to a higher proportion of income being generated in countries with lower income tax rates than the U.S statutory tax rate, as well as increased tax credits. The extension of the federal research credit provision was enacted in the Tax Relief Act of 2010. The total income tax benefit recognized in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations related to stock-based compensation was $44.1 million for the current fiscal year. See Note 7 Income Taxes to the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for our reconciliation of income taxes at the statutory federal rate to the provision for income taxes. In addition, in February 2009, the State of California enacted several income tax law changes which included an election to apply a single sales factor apportionment formula and adoption of a market sourcing approach for service income that will impact us beginning in fiscal 2012. As a result, we re-valued the anticipated future tax effects of our California temporary differences including stock-based compensation and purchased intangibles. Accordingly, we recorded an income tax expense of $2.2 million and $2.7 million related to this tax law change during 2011 and 2010 respectively.

Subscription and support revenues were $1.2 billion, or 93 percent of total revenues, for fiscal 2010, compared to $1.0 billion, or 91 percent of total revenues, during fiscal 2009. Professional services and other revenues were $96.1 million, or 7 percent of total revenues, for fiscal 2010, compared to $92.2 million, or 9 percent of total revenues, for fiscal 2009. The increase in professional services and other revenues was due primarily to the higher demand for services from an increased number of paying customers. Revenues in Europe and Asia Pacific accounted for $381.8 million, or 29 percent of total revenues, for fiscal 2010, compared to $300.3 million, or 28 percent of total revenues, during fiscal 2009, an increase of $81.5 million, or 27 percent. The increase in revenues outside of the Americas was the result of our efforts to expand internationally. As part of our overall growth, we expect the percentage of our revenue generated in Europe and Asia Pacific to continue to increase as a percentage of our total revenues world wide.

The increase in absolute dollars was primarily due to an increase of $8.4 million in employee-related costs, an increase of $1.5 million in stock-based expenses, an increase of $7.2 million in service delivery costs, primarily due to our investments in increasing data center capacity, an increase of $9.8 million in depreciation and amortization expenses, an increase of $6.7 million in outside subcontractor and other service costs and an increase of $1.6 million in allocated overhead. The cost of the professional services headcount resulted in the cost of professional services and other revenues to be in excess of the related revenue during fiscal 2010 by $2.6 million as compared to $1.2 million during fiscal 2009.

Our effective tax rate decreased to 41 percent for fiscal 2010 compared to 44 percent for fiscal 2009. The decrease was due to a higher proportion of income being generated in countries with lower income tax rates than the U.S. statutory tax rate as well as increased tax credits. The total income tax benefit recognized in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations related to stock-based compensation was $32.1 million for fiscal 2010. Liquidity and Capital Resources At January 31, 2011, our principal sources of liquidity were cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaling $1.4 billion and accounts receivable of $426.9 million. Net cash provided by operating activities was $459.1 million during fiscal 2011 and $270.9 million during the same period a year ago. The improvement in cash flow was due primarily to the growth in our customer base, increases in the contract values of our subscription service contracts, improving renewal rates and the associated increase in billings and collections. Cash provided by operating activities has historically been affected by: the amount of net income; sales of subscriptions, support and professional services; changes in working capital accounts, particularly increases and seasonality in accounts receivable and deferred revenue as described above, the timing of commission and bonus payments, and the timing of collections from large enterprise customers; add-backs of non-cash expense items such as depreciation and amortization, amortization of debt discount and the expense associated with stock-based awards. Net cash used in investing activities was $1.1 billion during fiscal 2011 and $378.6 million during the same period a year ago. The net cash used in investing activities during fiscal 2011 primarily related to the purchase of Jigsaw, Heroku, DimDim, the purchase of undeveloped land in San Francisco, California, investment of cash balances, and capital expenditures and strategic investments in public and private companies. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011, we purchased approximately 14 acres of undeveloped land in San Francisco, California, including entitlements and improvements associated with the land, and perpetual parking rights in an existing garage for approximately $278.0 million in cash. We plan to use the land to build our new global headquarters and therefore will devote additional financial resources in the future to build our new headquarters.  Net cash provided by financing activities was $14.1 million during fiscal 2011 and $637.2 million during the same period a year ago. Net cash provided by financing activities during fiscal 2011 consisted primarily of $160.4 million of proceeds from the exercise of employee stock options and $36.0 million of excess tax benefits from employee stock plans, offset by the $172.0 million in purchases of Salesforce Japan shares held by others and $10.4 million of principal payments on capital leases. In January 2010, we issued $575.0 million of 0.75% convertible senior notes due January 15, 2015 (the Notes) and concurrently entered into convertible notes hedges (the Note Hedges) and separate warrant transactions (the Warrants). The Notes will mature on January 15, 2015, unless earlier converted. As of January 31, 2011, the Notes have not been repurchased or converted. We also have not received any shares under the Note Hedges or delivered cash or shares under the Warrants. For 20 trading days during the 30 consecutive trading days ended January 31, 2011, our common stock traded at a price exceeding 130% of the conversion price of $85.36 per share applicable to the Notes. Accordingly, the Notes are convertible at the holders option for the quarter ending April 30, 2011. Upon conversion of any Notes, we will deliver cash up to the principal amount of the Notes and, with respect to any excess conversion value greater than the principal amount of the Notes, shares of our common stock, cash, or a combination of both. Therefore, for the quarter ending April 30, 2011, the Notes will be reclassified to a current liability on our consolidated balance sheet so long as the Notes are convertible. Our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities are comprised primarily of corporate notes and obligations, U.S. agency obligations, U.S. treasury securities, mortgage backed securities, collateralized mortgage obligations, time deposits, money market mutual funds, government obligations and municipal securities. As of January 31, 2011, we have a total of $8.9 million in letters of credit outstanding in favor of certain landlords for office space. To date, no amounts have been drawn against the letters of credit, which renew annually and mature at various dates through September 2021. We do not have any special purpose entities, and other than operating leases for office space and computer equipment, we do not engage in off-balance sheet financing arrangements. Additionally, we currently do not have a bank line of credit. Our principal commitments consist of obligations under leases for office space and co-location facilities for data center capacity and our development and test data center, and computer equipment and furniture and fixtures. At January 31, 2011, the future non-cancelable minimum payments under these commitments were as follows: ##TABLE_START (In thousands) Contractual Obligations  Payments Due by Period   Total   Less than 1 Year   1-3 Years   3-5 Years   More than 5 Years  Capital lease obligations  $ 18,637   $ 10,830   $ 7,807   $ 0   $ 0  Operating lease obligations:      Facilities space   436,944    75,166    150,438    91,549    119,791  Computer equipment and furniture and fixtures   62,340    32,177    30,163    0    0  Convertible Senior Notes, including interest   592,251    4,313    8,625    579,313    0  Contractual commitments   1,603    3    1,600    0    0  ##TABLE_END As of February 1, 2011 the Notes are convertible at the option of the noteholder. For 20 trading days during the 30 consecutive trading days ended January 31, 2011, our common stock traded at a price exceeding 130% of the conversion price of $85.36 per share applicable to the Notes. Accordingly, the Notes are convertible at the holders option for the quarter ending April 30, 2011. Upon conversion of any Notes, we will deliver cash up to  the principal amount of the Notes and, with respect to any excess conversion value greater than the principal amount of the Notes, shares of our common stock, cash, or a combination of both. This potential repayment of the Notes is not reflected in the timing of the payments due by period above. We have a contractual obligation to begin construction on the undeveloped land by September 2014. If we do not commence construction by this date we will be subject to certain penalties due to a third party. These potential penalties are not reflected in the timing of the payments due by period above. We do not believe we will be subject to these penalties. Our lease agreements provide us with the option to renew. Our future operating lease obligations would change if we exercised these options and if we entered into additional operating lease agreements as we expand our operations. Purchase orders are not included in the table above. Our purchase orders represent authorizations to purchase rather than binding agreements. The contractual commitment amounts in the table above are associated with agreements that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms, including: fixed or minimum services to be used; fixed, minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. Obligations under contracts that we can cancel without a significant penalty are not included in the table above. The timing of tax settlements are not included in the table above. We are unable to make a reasonable estimate of the timing of payments in individual years beyond 12 months due to uncertainties in the timing of tax settlements. For further information, see Note 7 to the notes to consolidated financial statements. We recorded liabilities related to uncertain tax positions. We believe our existing cash, cash equivalents and short-term marketable securities and cash provided by operating activities will be sufficient to meet our working capital and capital expenditure needs over the next 12 months. During fiscal 2012, we may enter into arrangements to acquire or invest in complementary businesses or joint ventures, services or technologies. While we believe we have sufficient financial resources to do so, we may be required to seek additional equity or debt financing. Additional funds may not be available on terms favorable to us or at all. Recent Accounting Pronouncement In September 2009, the Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, issued Update No. 2009-13,  Revenue Recognition (Topic 605) , Multiple-Deliverable Revenue Arrangementsa consensus of the FASB Emerging Issues Task Force (ASU 2009-13). It updates the existing multiple-element revenue arrangements guidance currently included under ASC 605-25. The revised guidance primarily provides two significant changes: 1) eliminates the need for objective and reliable evidence of the fair value for the undelivered element in order for a delivered item to be treated as a separate unit of accounting, and 2) requires the use of the relative selling price method to allocate the entire arrangement consideration. In addition, the guidance also expands the disclosure requirements for revenue recognition. ASU 2009-13 will be effective for us at the start of fiscal 2012. We believe the future impact of this new accounting pronouncement will not be material to our consolidated net income.  ##TABLE_START ", "7A": " ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK ##TABLE_END Foreign currency exchange risk Our results of operations and cash flows are subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates, particularly changes in the Euro, British Pound Sterling, Canadian dollar, Swiss franc, Singapore dollar, Japanese Yen and Australian dollar. We seek to minimize the impact of certain foreign currency fluctuations by hedging certain balance sheet exposures with foreign currency forward contracts. Any gain or loss from settling these contracts is offset by the loss or gain derived from the underlying balance sheet exposures. In accordance with our policy, the hedging contracts we enter into have maturities of less than three months. Additionally, by policy, we do not enter into any hedging contracts for trading or speculative purposes. Interest rate sensitivity We had cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaling $1.4 billion at January 31, 2011. This amount was invested primarily in money market funds, time deposits, corporate notes and bonds, government securities and other debt securities with credit ratings of at least single A or better. The cash, cash equivalents and short-term marketable securities are held for working capital purposes. Our investments are made for capital preservation purposes. We do not enter into investments for trading or speculative purposes. Our cash equivalents and our portfolio of marketable securities are subject to market risk due to changes in interest rates. Fixed rate securities may have their market value adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates, while floating rate securities may produce less income than expected if interest rates fall. Due in part to these factors, our future investment income may fall short of expectation due to changes in interest rates or we may suffer losses in principal if we are forced to sell securities that decline in market value due to changes in interest rates. However because we classify our debt securities as available for sale, no gains or losses are recognized due to changes in interest rates unless such securities are sold prior to maturity or declines in fair value are determined to be other-than-temporary. Our fixed-income portfolio is subject to interest rate risk. An immediate increase or decrease in interest rates of 100-basis points at January 31, 2011 could result in a $27.7 million market value reduction or increase of the same amount. This estimate is based on a sensitivity model that measures market value changes when changes in interest rates occur. Fluctuations in the value of our investment securities caused by a change in interest rates (gains or losses on the carrying value) are recorded in other comprehensive income, and are realized only if we sell the underlying securities. At January 31, 2010, we had cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaling $1.7 billion. The fixed-income portfolio was also subject to interest rate risk. Changes in interest rates of 100-basis points would have resulted in market value changes of $13.1 million. Market Risk and Market Interest Risk In January 2010, we issued at par value $575.0 million of 0.75% convertible senior notes due 2015 (the Notes). Holders may convert their Notes prior to maturity upon the occurrence of certain circumstances. Upon conversion, we would pay the holder an amount of cash equal to the principal amount of the Notes. Amounts in excess of the principal amount, if any, may be paid in cash or stock at our option. Concurrent with the issuance of the Notes, we entered into separate note hedging transactions and the sale of warrants. These separate transactions were completed to reduce the potential economic dilution from the conversion of the Notes. As of February 1, 2011 the Notes are convertible at the option of the noteholder. For 20 trading days during the 30 consecutive trading days ended January 31, 2011, our common stock traded at a price exceeding 130% of the conversion price of $85.36 per share applicable to the Notes. Accordingly, the Notes are convertible at the holders option for the quarter ending April 30, 2011. Upon conversion of any Notes, we will deliver cash up to the principal amount of the Notes and, with respect to any excess conversion value greater than the principal  amount of the Notes, shares of our common stock, cash, or a combination of both. Therefore, as of February 1, 2011, the Notes will be reclassified to a current liability on our consolidated balance sheet so long as the Notes are convertible. The Notes have a fixed annual interest rate of 0.75% and therefore, we do not have economic interest rate exposure on the Notes. However, the value of the Notes are exposed to interest rate risk. Generally, the fair market value of our fixed interest rate Notes will increase as interest rates fall and decrease as interest rates rise. In addition, the fair value of our Notes is affected by our stock price. The carrying value of our Notes was $472.5 million as of January 31, 2011. This represents the liability component of the $575.0 million principal balance as of January 31, 2011. The total estimated fair value of our Notes at January 31, 2011 was $946.1 million and the fair value was determined based on the closing trading price per $100 of the Notes as of the last day of trading for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011, which was $164.55. We have an investment portfolio that includes strategic investments in public and privately-held companies, many of which are in the development stage. When our ownership interests are less than 20 percent and we do not have the ability to exert significant influence, we account for the minority equity investments using the cost method of accounting. Otherwise, we account for the investments using the equity method of accounting. At January 31, 2011, the fair value of these investments was $27.1 million.  ##TABLE_START ", "8": " ITEM 8.

Our audits also included the financial statement schedule listed in the Index at Item 15(c). These financial statements and schedule are the responsibility of the Companys management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and schedule based on our audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of salesforce.com, inc. at January 31, 2011 and 2010, and the consolidated results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended January 31, 2011, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.

We have audited salesforce.com, inc.s internal control over financial reporting as of January 31, 2011, based on criteria established in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (the COSO criteria). salesforce.com, inc.s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Managements Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Companys internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. A companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the Company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. In our opinion, salesforce.com, inc. maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of January 31, 2011, based on the COSO criteria. We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated balance sheets of salesforce.com, inc. as of January 31, 2011 and 2010, and the related consolidated statements of operations, stockholders equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended January 31, 2011 of salesforce.com, inc. and our report dated March 23, 2011 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon. /s/ E RNST  Y OUNG LLP San Jose, California March 23, 2011  salesforce.com, inc.

The Company offers its services on a subscription basis. Fiscal Year The Companys fiscal year ends on January 31. References to fiscal 2011, for example, refer to the fiscal year ending January 31, 2011. Use of Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions in the Companys consolidated financial statements and notes thereto. Significant estimates and assumptions made by management include the determination of the provision for income taxes, the fair value of stock awards issued, and the determination of the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed for business acquisitions. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Principles of Consolidation The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly owned subsidiaries. All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. In December 2000, the Company established a Japanese joint venture, Kabushiki Kaisha salesforce.com (Salesforce Japan), with SunBridge, Inc., a Japanese corporation, to assist the Company with its sales efforts in Japan. During fiscal 2011, the Company acquired SunBridges and other shareholders interest in Salesforce Japan, and increased the Companys ownership from 72 percent to 100 percent. As the Company did not obtain 100 percent ownership until the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011, the Company recorded a noncontrolling interest in the consolidated statement of operations for the noncontrolling investors interests in the net assets and operations of the Salesforce Japan. Noncontrolling interest of $0 and $12.9 million as of January 31, 2011 and 2010 is reflected in stockholders equity, respectively. Segments The Company operates in one segment. Foreign Currency Translation The functional currency of the Companys major foreign subsidiaries is generally the local currency. Adjustments resulting from translating foreign functional currency financial statements into U.S. dollars are recorded as part of a separate component of stockholders equity. Foreign currency transaction gains and losses are included in net income for the period. All assets and liabilities denominated in a foreign currency are  translated into U.S. dollars at the exchange rate on the balance sheet date. Revenues and expenses are translated at the average exchange rate during the period. Equity transactions are translated using historical exchange rates. Concentrations of Credit Risk and Significant Customers The Companys financial instruments that are exposed to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities and trade accounts receivable. Although the Company deposits its cash with multiple financial institutions, its deposits, at times, may exceed federally insured limits. Collateral is not required for accounts receivable. The Company maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts receivable balances. The allowance is based upon historical loss patterns, the number of days that billings are past due and an evaluation of the potential risk of loss associated with delinquent accounts. No customer accounted for more than 5 percent of accounts receivable at January 31, 2011 and 2010. No single customer accounted for 5 percent or more of total revenue during fiscal 2011, 2010, and 2009. As of January 31, 2011 and 2010, assets located outside the Americas were 16 percent and 12 percent of total assets, respectively. Revenues by geographical region are as follows (in thousands): ##TABLE_START   Fiscal Year Ended January 31,    2011   2010   2009  Revenues by geography:    Americas  $ 1,135,019   $ 923,823   $ 776,495  Europe   291,784    232,367    190,685  Asia Pacific   230,336    149,393    109,589               $ 1,657,139   $ 1,305,583   $ 1,076,769              ##TABLE_END Cash and Cash Equivalents The Company considers all highly liquid investments purchased with an original maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents. Cash and cash equivalents are stated at fair value. Marketable Securities Management determines the appropriate classification of marketable securities at the time of purchase and reevaluates such determination at each balance sheet date. Securities are classified as available for sale and are carried at fair value, with the unrealized gains and losses, net of tax, reported as a separate component of stockholders equity. Fair value is determined based on quoted market rates when observable or utilizing data points that are observable, such as quoted prices, interest rates and yield curves. Declines in fair value judged to be other-than-temporary on securities available for sale are included as a component of investment income. In order to determine whether a decline in value is other-than-temporary, we evaluate, among other factors: the duration and extent to which the fair value has been less than the carrying value and our intent and ability to retain the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in fair market value. The cost of securities sold is based on the specific-identification method. Interest on securities classified as available for sale is also included as a component of investment income. Fair Value Measurement The Company reports its financial and non-financial assets and liabilities that are re-measured and reported at fair value at each reporting period.  The Company measures its cash equivalents, marketable securities, foreign currency derivative contracts and contingent considerations related to acquisitions at fair value. All of the Companys cash equivalents, marketable securities and foreign currency derivative contracts are classified within Level 1 or Level 2, which are described below. This is because the Companys cash equivalents, marketable securities and foreign currency derivative contracts are valued using quoted market prices or alternative pricing sources and models utilizing market observable inputs. The Company established a three-tier fair value hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used in the valuation methodologies in measuring fair value: ##TABLE_START Level 1.  Observable inputs that reflect quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical assets or liabilities in active markets. Level 2.  Include other inputs that are directly or indirectly observable in the marketplace. Level 3.  Unobservable inputs which are supported by little or no market activity. ##TABLE_END The following table presents information about the Companys assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value as of January 31, 2011 and indicates the fair value hierarchy of the valuation (in thousands): ##TABLE_START Description  Quoted Prices in Active Markets for Identical Assets (Level 1)   Significant Other Observable Inputs (Level 2)   Significant Unobservable Inputs (Level 3)   Balances as of January 31, 2011  Cash equivalents (1):     Time deposits  $ 26,565   $ 0   $ 0   $ 26,565  Money market mutual funds   122,516    0    0    122,516  Marketable securities:     Corporate notes and obligations   0    707,613    0    707,613  U.S. agency obligations   0    79,408    0    79,408  U.S. treasury securities   22,706    0    0    22,706  Government obligations   6,532    0    0    6,532  Mortgage backed securities   0    38,886    0    38,886  Collateralized mortgage obligations   0    105,039    0    105,039  Municipal securities   0    23,081    0    23,081  Foreign currency derivative contracts (2)   0    1,539    0    1,539                  Total Assets  $ 178,319   $ 955,566   $ 0   $ 1,133,885                  Liabilities     Foreign currency derivative contracts (3)  $ 0   $ 2,863   $ 0   $ 2,863  Contingent considerations (related to acquisitions, see Note 6) (3)   0    0    17,138    17,138                  Total Liabilities  $ 0   $ 2,863   $ 17,138   $ 20,001                  ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START (1) Included in cash and cash equivalents in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheet as of January 31, 2011, in addition to $275.2 million of cash. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START (2) Included in prepaid expenses and other current assets in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheet as of January 31, 2011. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START (3) Included in accrued expenses and other current liabilities in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheet as of January 31, 2011. ##TABLE_END  The following table presents the Companys liabilities measured at fair value using significant unobservable inputs (Level 3) at January 31, 2011. These liabilities consist of the Companys contingent considerations related to acquisitions. During fiscal 2011, the Company recorded the fair value of the Companys contingent considerations using a discounted cash flow model (in thousands): ##TABLE_START Balance at February 1, 2010  $ 0  Additions   17,138      Balance at January 31, 2011  $ 17,138      ##TABLE_END The following table presents information about the Companys assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of January 31, 2010 and indicates the fair value hierarchy of the valuation (in thousands): ##TABLE_START Description  Quoted Prices in Active Markets for Identical Assets (Level 1)   Significant Other Observable Inputs (Level 2)   Significant Unobservable Inputs (Level 3)   Balances as of January 31, 2010  Cash equivalents (1):     Time deposits  $ 11,410   $ 0   $ 0   $ 11,410  Money market mutual funds   123,868    0    0    123,868  U.S. treasury securities   399,140    0    0    399,140  U.S. agency obligations   0    364,197    0    364,197  Marketable securities:     Corporate notes and obligations   0    337,574    0    337,574  U.S. agency obligations   0    163,455    0    163,455  U.S. treasury securities   136,660    0    0    136,660  Mortgage backed securities   0    40,865    0    40,865  Collateralized mortgage obligations   0    37,188    0    37,188  Foreign currency derivative contracts (2)   0    1,593    0    1,593                  Total Assets  $ 671,078   $ 944,872   $ 0   $ 1,615,950                  Liabilities     Foreign currency derivative contracts (3)  $ 0   $ 402   $ 0   $ 402                  Total Liabilities  $ 0   $ 402   $ 0   $ 402                  ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START (1) Included in cash and cash equivalents in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheet as of January 31, 2010, in addition to $112.7 million of cash. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START (2) Included in prepaid expenses and other current assets in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheet as of January 31, 2010. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START (3) Included in accrued expenses and other current liabilities in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheet as of January 31, 2010. ##TABLE_END Strategic Investments The Company has one investment in a marketable security and certain interests in non-marketable securities that the Company considers strategic investments. The costs of the non-marketable securities included in strategic investments approximates their fair value. The total fair value of the Companys strategic investments was $27.1 million and $6.3 million as of January 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. The fair value of the Companys marketable security of $6.0 million includes an unrealized gain of $5.2 million as of January 31, 2011. Strategic investments are recorded in Other Assets, net on the consolidated balance sheet.  Derivative Financial Instruments The Company enters into foreign currency derivative contracts with financial institutions to reduce the risk that its cash flows and earnings will be adversely affected by foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. The Company uses forward currency derivative contracts to minimize the Companys exposure of balances denominated in Euros, Swiss francs, Australian dollars, Singapore dollars, Japanese yen and British pounds. The Companys foreign currency derivative contracts which are not designated as hedging instruments are used to reduce the exchange rate risk associated primarily with intercompany receivables and payables. The Companys program is not designated for trading or speculative purposes. As of January 31, 2011 and 2010 the foreign currency derivative contracts that were not settled are recorded at fair value on the consolidated balance sheet. Foreign currency derivative contracts are marked-to-market at the end of each reporting period with gains and losses recognized as other income (expense) to offset the gains or losses resulting from the settlement or remeasurement of the underlying foreign currency denominated receivables and payables. While the contract or notional amount is often used to express the volume of foreign currency derivative contracts, the amounts potentially subject to credit risk are generally limited to the amounts, if any, by which the counterparties obligations under the agreements exceed the obligations of the Company to the counterparties. Details on outstanding foreign currency derivative contracts related primarily to intercompany receivables and payables are presented below (in thousands): ##TABLE_START   January 31, 2011   January 31, 2010  Notional amount of foreign currency derivative contracts  $ 202,491   $ 74,705  Fair value of foreign currency derivative contracts  $ (1,324 )  $ 1,191  ##TABLE_END The Companys fair value of our outstanding derivative instruments are summarized below (in thousands): ##TABLE_START      Fair Value of Derivative Instruments    Balance Sheet Location   As of January 31, 2011   As of January 31, 2010  Derivative Assets    Derivatives not designated as hedging instruments:    Foreign currency derivative contracts    Prepaid expenses and other current assets    $ 1,539   $ 1,593           Derivative Liabilities    Derivatives not designated as hedging instruments:    Foreign currency derivative contracts    Accrued expenses and other current liabilities    $ 2,863   $ 402           ##TABLE_END The effect of the derivative instruments not designated as hedging instruments on the Consolidated Statements of Operations for the year ended January 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively are summarized below (in thousands): ##TABLE_START Derivatives Not Designated as Hedging Instruments  Gains (Losses) Recognized in Income on Derivative Instruments       Year ended January 31,    Location   2011   2010   2009  Foreign currency derivative contracts   Other expense   $ (1,324 )  $ 1,191   $ (1,004 )              ##TABLE_END  Investment Income Investment income consists of interest income, realized gains, and realized losses on the Companys cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities. The components of investment income are presented below (in thousands): ##TABLE_START   Fiscal Year Ended January 31,  (In thousands)  2011   2010   2009  Interest income  $ 28,273   $ 21,219   $ 24,295  Realized gains   12,460    13,391    1,048  Realized losses   (2,998 )   (4,202 )   (2,569 )             Total investment income  $ 37,735   $ 30,408   $ 22,774              ##TABLE_END Interest Expense Interest expense consists of interest on the Companys capital lease commitments and 0.75% convertible senior notes (the Notes). As described in Note 2, in accounting for the Notes at the time of issuance in January 2010, the carrying amount of the liability component was calculated by measuring the fair value of a similar liability that did not have an associated convertible feature. The excess of the principal amount of the liability component over its carrying amount (debt discount) is amortized, using an effective interest rate of 5.86%, to interest expense over the term of the Notes. Property and Equipment Fixed assets are stated at cost. Depreciation is calculated on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of those assets as follows: ##TABLE_START Computers, equipment, and software  3 to 5 years Furniture and fixtures  5 years Leasehold improvements  Shorter of the estimated useful life or the lease term Buildings and improvements  Amortized over the estimated useful lives of the respective assets when they are ready for their intended use. ##TABLE_END When assets are retired, the cost and accumulated depreciation and amortization are removed from their respective accounts and any loss on such retirement is reflected in operating expenses. When assets are otherwise disposed of, the cost and related accumulated depreciation and amortization are removed from their respective accounts and any gain or loss on such sale or disposal is reflected in other income. Capitalized Interest Cost Interest costs related to major construction projects, specifically the Companys campus project and capitalized internal-use software development costs, are capitalized until the underlying asset is placed into service. Capitalized interest is calculated by multiplying the effective interest rate of the Notes by the qualifying costs. As the qualifying asset is placed into service, the qualifying asset and the related capitalized interest are amortized over the useful life of the related asset. Interest costs of $3.7 million related to the buildings and improvements and $0.3 million related to the Companys capitalized internal-use software development efforts were capitalized in fiscal 2011. No interest costs were capitalized in fiscal 2010.  Impairment of Long-Lived Assets The Company evaluates the recoverability of its long-lived assets for possible impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable. If such review indicates that the carrying amount of long-lived assets is not recoverable, the carrying amount of such assets is reduced to fair value. There was no impairment of long-lived assets during fiscal 2011, 2010, and 2009. The Company evaluates and tests the recoverability of the goodwill for impairment annually in the fourth quarter or more often if and when circumstances indicate that goodwill may not be recoverable. There was no impairment of goodwill during fiscal 2011, 2010, and 2009. Capitalized Software Costs For its website development costs and the development costs related to its enterprise cloud computing services, the company capitalizes costs incurred during the application development stage. Costs related to preliminary project activities and post implementation activities were expensed as incurred. Internal-use software is amortized on a straight line basis over its estimated useful life, generally three years. Management evaluates the useful lives of these assets on an annual basis and tests for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances occur that could impact the recoverability of these assets. The Company capitalized $19.6 million, $15.1 million, and $10.2 million of costs during fiscal 2011, 2010, and 2009, respectively. Amortization expense totaled $13.1 million, $9.9 million, and $6.6 million during fiscal 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. Comprehensive Income (loss) Comprehensive income (loss) consists of net income and accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), which includes certain changes in equity that are excluded from net income. Specifically, cumulative foreign currency translation adjustments and unrealized gains and losses on marketable securities, net of taxes of $5.0 million in fiscal 2011 and $3.9 million in fiscal 2010, are included in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) has been reflected in stockholders equity. The components of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) were as follows (in thousands): ##TABLE_START   As of January 31,    2011   2010  Foreign currency translation and other adjustments  $ (1,357 )  $ (7,066 ) Net unrealized gain on marketable securities   8,076    5,636           $ 6,719   $ (1,430 )         ##TABLE_END Net Income Per Share Basic net income per share attributable to salesforce.com is computed by dividing net income attributable to salesforce.com by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding for the fiscal period. Diluted net income per share attributable to salesforce.com is computed giving effect to all potential weighted average dilutive common stock, including options, restricted stock units, warrants and the convertible senior notes. The dilutive effect of outstanding awards is reflected in diluted earnings per share by application of the treasury stock method.  A reconciliation of the denominator used in the calculation of basic and diluted net income per share attributable to salesforce.com is as follows (in thousands): ##TABLE_START   Fiscal Year Ended January 31,    2011   2010   2009  Numerator:    Net income attributable to salesforce.com  $ 64,474   $ 80,719   $ 43,428              Denominator:    Weighted-average shares outstanding for basic earnings per share   130,222    124,462    121,183  Effect of dilutive securities:    0.75% convertible senior notes   1,561    0    0  Employee stock awards   4,815    3,652    4,045              Adjusted weighted-average shares outstanding and assumed conversions for diluted earnings per share   136,598    128,114    125,228              ##TABLE_END The following were excluded from the computation of diluted shares outstanding as they would have had an anti-dilutive impact. The dilutive securities are excluded when, for example, their exercise prices, unrecognized compensation and tax benefits are greater than the average fair values of the Companys common stock (in thousands). These securities could be included in the future if the average market value of the Companys common shares increases and is greater than the exercise price. ##TABLE_START   Fiscal Year Ended January 31,    2011   2010   2009  Stock awards   1,061    4,455    3,797  Warrants   6,736    6,736    0  ##TABLE_END Income Taxes The Company uses the liability method of accounting for income taxes. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on temporary differences between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities and net operating loss and credit carryforwards using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. Valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amounts more likely than not expected to be realized. Tax positions for the Company and its subsidiaries are subject to income tax audits by multiple tax jurisdictions throughout the world. The Company recognizes the tax benefit of an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the position is sustainable upon examination by the taxing authority, based on the technical merits. The tax benefit recognized is measured as the largest amount of benefit which is greater than 50 percent likely to be realized upon settlement with the taxing authority. The Company recognizes interest accrued and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in its tax provision. The total income tax benefit recognized in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations related to stock-based awards was $44.1 million, $32.1 million and $26.3 million for fiscal 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. Revenue Recognition The Company derives its revenues from two sources: (1) subscription revenues, which are comprised of subscription fees from customers accessing its enterprise cloud computing application service, and from customers purchasing additional support beyond the standard support that is included in the basic subscription fee; and (2) related professional services and other revenue. Other revenue consists primarily of training fees. The Company recognizes revenue when all of the following conditions are met: ##TABLE_START    There is persuasive evidence of an arrangement; ##TABLE_END  ##TABLE_START    The service has been provided to the customer; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    The collection of the fees is reasonably assured; and ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    The amount of fees to be paid by the customer is fixed or determinable. ##TABLE_END The Companys arrangements do not contain general rights of return. Subscription and support revenues are recognized ratably over the contract terms beginning on the commencement date of each contract. Amounts that have been invoiced are recorded in accounts receivable and in deferred revenue or revenue, depending on whether the revenue recognition criteria have been met. Professional services and other revenues, when sold with subscription and support offerings, are accounted for separately when these services have value to the customer on a standalone basis and there is objective and reliable evidence of fair value of each deliverable. When accounted for separately, revenues are recognized as the services are rendered for time and material contracts, and when the milestones are achieved and accepted by the customer for fixed price contracts. The majority of the Companys consulting contracts are on a time and materials basis. Training revenues are recognized after the services are performed. For revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables, such as an arrangement that includes subscription, premium support and consulting or training services, the Company allocates the total amount the customer will pay to the separate units of accounting based on their relative fair values, as determined by the price of the undelivered items when sold separately. In determining whether the consulting services can be accounted for separately from subscription and support revenues, the Company considers the following factors for each consulting agreement: availability of the consulting services from other vendors, whether objective and reliable evidence for fair value exists for the undelivered elements, the nature of the consulting services, the timing of when the consulting contract was signed in comparison to the subscription service start date, and the contractual dependence of the subscription service on the customers satisfaction with the consulting work. If a consulting arrangement does not qualify for separate accounting, the Company recognizes the consulting revenue ratably over the remaining term of the subscription contract. Additionally, in these situations, the Company defers only the direct costs of the consulting arrangement and amortizes those costs over the same time period as the consulting revenue is recognized. As of January 31, 2011 and 2010, the deferred cost on the accompanying consolidated balance sheet totaled $28.1 million and $19.1 million, respectively. These deferred costs are included in prepaid expenses and other current assets and other assets. Deferred Revenue Deferred revenue primarily consists of billings or payments received in advance of revenue recognition from the Companys subscription service described above and is recognized as the revenue recognition criteria are met. The Company generally invoices its customers in annual or quarterly installments. Accordingly, the deferred revenue balance does not represent the total contract value of annual or multi-year, non-cancelable subscription agreements. Deferred revenue also includes certain deferred professional services fees which are recognized as revenue ratably over the subscription contract term. The Company defers the professional service fees in situations where the professional services and subscription contracts are accounted for as a single unit of accounting. Deferred revenue that will be recognized during the succeeding 12-month period is recorded as current deferred revenue and the remaining portion is recorded as noncurrent. Approximately 6 percent of total deferred revenue as of both January 31, 2011 and 2010, related to deferred professional services revenue. Deferred Commissions Deferred commissions are the incremental costs that are directly associated with non-cancelable subscription contracts with customers and consist of sales commissions paid to the Companys direct sales force.  The commissions are deferred and amortized over the non-cancelable terms of the related customer contracts, which are typically 12 to 24 months. The commission payments are paid in full the month after the customers service commences. The deferred commission amounts are recoverable through the future revenue streams under the non-cancelable customer contracts. The Company believes this is the preferable method of accounting as the commission charges are so closely related to the revenue from the non-cancelable customer contracts that they should be recorded as an asset and charged to expense over the same period that the subscription revenue is recognized. Amortization of deferred commissions is included in marketing and sales expense in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations. Business Combinations The Company recognizes separately from goodwill the fair value of assets acquired and the liabilities assumed. Goodwill as of the acquisition date is measured as the excess of consideration transferred and the net of the acquisition date fair values of the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed. While the Company uses its best estimates and assumptions as a part of the purchase price allocation process to accurately value assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date, the Companys estimates are inherently uncertain and subject to refinement. As a result, during the measurement period, which may be up to one year from the acquisition date, the Company may record adjustments to the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed, with the corresponding offset to goodwill. Upon the conclusion of the measurement period or final determination of the fair value of assets acquired or liabilities assumed, whichever comes first, any subsequent adjustments are recorded to the Companys consolidated statements of operations. In addition, uncertain tax positions and tax related valuation allowances assumed in connection with a business combination are initially estimated as of the acquisition date. The Company reevaluates these items quarterly and records any adjustments to the Companys preliminary estimates to goodwill provided that the Company is within the measurement period and the Company continues to collect information in order to determine their estimated fair values as of the date of acquisition. Subsequent to the measurement period or the Companys final determination of the tax allowances or contingencys estimated value, changes to these uncertain tax positions and tax related valuation allowances will affect the Companys provision for income taxes in the Companys consolidated statement of operations. Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation The Company recognizes share-based expenses on a straight-line over the requisite service period of the awards, which is the vesting term of four years. Stock-based expenses are recognized net of estimated forfeiture activity. The fair value of each option grant was estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model with the following assumptions and fair value per share: ##TABLE_START   2011  2010  2009 Volatility  45 - 50%  50 - 60%  47 - 60% Estimated life  3.7 - 3.8 years  3.8 - 4 years  4 years Weighted-average risk-free interest rate  0.98 - 2.1%  1.78 - 2.39%  1.47 - 3.08% Dividend yield  0  0  0 Weighted-average fair value per share of grants  $48.83  $24.73  $15.39 ##TABLE_END Since November 2009, the weighted-average estimated life was based on an actual analysis of expected life. Prior to November 2009, the weighted-average estimated life assumption of 4 years was based on the average of the vesting term and the 5 year contractual lives of options awarded. The weighted average risk free interest rate is based on the rate for a 4 year U.S. government security at the time of the option grant.  The Company estimated its future stock price volatility considering both its observed option-implied volatilities and its historical volatility calculations. Management believes this is the best estimate of the expected volatility over the weighted-average expected life of its option grants. During fiscal 2011 and 2010, the Company capitalized $2.6 million and $2.4 million, respectively, of stock based expenses related to capitalized internal-use software development and deferred professional services costs. During fiscal 2011, the Company recognized stock-based expense of $120.4 million. As of January 31, 2011, the aggregate stock compensation remaining to be amortized to costs and expenses was $559.8 million. The Company expects this stock compensation balance to be amortized as follows: $195.1 million during fiscal 2012; $157.9 million during fiscal 2013; $129.6 million during fiscal 2014; $76.8 million during fiscal 2015 and $0.4 million during fiscal 2016. The expected amortization reflects only outstanding stock awards as of January 31, 2011 and assumes no forfeiture activity. The Company expects to continue to issue share-based awards to its employees in future periods. Warranties and Indemnification The Companys enterprise cloud computing application service is typically warranted to perform in a manner consistent with general industry standards that are reasonably applicable and materially in accordance with the Companys online help documentation under normal use and circumstances. The Companys arrangements generally include certain provisions for indemnifying customers against liabilities if its products or services infringe a third-partys intellectual property rights. To date, the Company has not incurred any material costs as a result of such indemnifications and has not accrued any liabilities related to such obligations in the accompanying consolidated financial statements. The Company has also agreed to indemnify its directors and executive officers for costs associated with any fees, expenses, judgments, fines and settlement amounts incurred by any of these persons in any action or proceeding to which any of those persons is, or is threatened to be, made a party by reason of the persons service as a director or officer, including any action by the Company, arising out of that persons services as the Companys director or officer or that persons services provided to any other company or enterprise at the Companys request. The Company maintains director and officer insurance coverage that would generally enable the Company to recover a portion of any future amounts paid. The Company may also be subject to indemnification obligations by law with respect to the actions of its employees under certain circumstances and in certain jurisdictions. Advertising Expenses Advertising is expensed as incurred. Advertising expense was $61.4 million, $50.8 million and $43.7 million for fiscal 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. Subsequent Events The Company evaluated subsequent events through the date this Annual Report on Form 10-K was filed with the SEC. In February 2011, the Company acquired a privately-held company for approximately $11.3 million in cash. As of February 1, 2011 the Notes due 2015 are convertible at the option of the noteholder. For 20 trading days during the 30 consecutive trading days ended January 31, 2011, the Companys common stock traded at a price exceeding 130% of the conversion price of $85.36 per share applicable to the Notes. Accordingly, the  Notes are convertible at the holders option for the quarter ending April 30, 2011. Upon conversion of any Notes, the Company will deliver cash up to the principal amount of the Notes and, with respect to any excess conversion value greater than the principal amount of the Notes, shares of the Companys common stock, cash, or a combination of both. Therefore, for the quarter ending April 30, 2011, the Notes will be reclassified to a current liability on the Companys consolidated balance sheet. In addition to the Notes being reclassified to a current liability as described above, a portion of the equity component of the Notes, as described in Note 2 of the consolidated financial statements, will be reclassified from additional paid-in capital to temporary salesforce.com stockholders equity on the consolidated balance sheet. New Accounting Pronouncement In September 2009, the FASB issued Update No. 2009-13, Multiple-Deliverable Revenue Arrangementsa consensus of the FASB Emerging Issues Task Force (ASU 2009-13). It updates the existing multiple-element revenue arrangements guidance currently included under ASC 605-25, which originated primarily from the guidance in EITF Issue No. 00-21, Revenue Arrangements with Multiple Deliverables (EITF 00-21). The revised guidance primarily provides two significant changes: 1) eliminates the need for objective and reliable evidence of the fair value for the undelivered element in order for a delivered item to be treated as a separate unit of accounting, and 2) requires the use of the relative selling price method to allocate the entire arrangement consideration. In addition, the guidance also expands the disclosure requirements for revenue recognition. ASU 2009-13 will be effective for the Company at the start of fiscal 2012. The Company believes the future impact of this new accounting pronouncement will not be material to consolidated net income. Reclassifications Certain reclassifications to the fiscal 2010 and 2009 balances were made to conform to the current period presentation. These reclassifications include deferred income taxes, strategic investments and income taxes payable. 2.

Interest is payable semi-annually in arrears on January 15 and July 15 of each year, commencing July 15, 2010. The Notes are governed by an Indenture dated as of January 19, 2010, between the Company, as issuer, and U.S. Bank National Association, as trustee. The Notes do not contain any financial covenants or any restrictions on the payment of dividends, the incurrence of senior debt or other indebtedness, or the issuance or repurchase of securities by the Company. The Notes are unsecured and rank senior in right of payment to the Companys future indebtedness that is expressly subordinated in right of payment to the Notes and rank equal in right of payment to the Companys existing and future unsecured indebtedness that is not so subordinated and are effectively subordinated in right of payment to any of the Companys cash equal to the principal amount of the Notes, and secured indebtedness to the extent of the value of the assets securing such indebtedness and are structurally subordinated to all existing and future indebtedness and liabilities incurred by our subsidiaries, including trade payables. If converted, holders will receive cash equal to the principal amount of the Notes, and at the Companys election, cash and/or shares of the Companys common stock for any amounts in excess of the principal amounts. The initial conversion rate is 11.7147 shares of common stock per $1,000 principal amount of Notes, subject to anti-dilution adjustments. The initial conversion price is $85.36 per share of common stock. Throughout the term of the Notes, the conversion rate may be adjusted upon the occurrence of certain events, including for any cash dividends. Holders of the Notes will not receive any cash payment representing accrued and unpaid interest upon conversion of a Note. Accrued but unpaid interest will be deemed to be paid in full upon conversion rather than cancelled, extinguished or forfeited. Holders may convert their Notes under the following circumstances: ##TABLE_START    during any fiscal quarter, if, for at least 20 trading days during the 30 consecutive trading day period ending on the last trading day of the immediately preceding fiscal quarter, the last reported sales price of the Companys common stock for such trading day is greater than or equal to 130% of the applicable conversion price on such trading day share of common stock on such last trading day; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    in certain situations, when the trading price of the Notes is less than 98% of the product of the sale price of the Companys common stock and the conversion rate; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    upon the occurrence of specified corporate transactions described under the Notes Indenture, such as a consolidation, merger or binding share exchange; or ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    at any time on or after October 15, 2014. ##TABLE_END As of January 31, 2011, the Notes are not yet convertible up to 6.7 million shares of the Companys common stock. For at least 20 trading days during the 30 consecutive trading days ended January 31, 2011, the Companys common stock price exceeded the conversion price of $85.36 per share. Accordingly, the Notes are convertible at the holders option for the quarter ending April 30, 2011. Upon conversion of any Notes, the Company will deliver cash up to the principal amount of the Notes and with respect to any excess conversion value greater than the principal amount of the Notes, shares of the Companys common stock, cash, or a combination of both at the Companys election. Holders of the Notes have the right to require the Company to purchase with cash all or a portion of the Notes upon the occurrence of a fundamental change, such as a change of control at a purchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Notes plus accrued and unpaid interest. Following certain corporate transactions that constitute a change of control, the Company will increase the conversion rate for a holder who elects to convert the Notes in connection with such change of control in certain circumstances.  In accounting for the issuance of the Notes, the Company separated the Notes into liability and equity components. The carrying amount of the liability component was calculated by measuring the fair value of a similar liability that does not have an associated convertible feature. The carrying amount of the equity component representing the conversion option was determined by deducting the fair value of the liability component from the par value of the Notes as a whole. The excess of the principal amount of the liability component over its carrying amount (debt discount) is amortized to interest expense over the term of the Note. The equity component is not remeasured as long as it continues to meet the conditions for equity classification. In accounting for the transaction costs related to the Note issuance, the Company allocated the total amount incurred to the liability and equity components. Transaction costs attributable to the liability component are being amortized to expense over the term of the Notes, and transaction costs attributable to the equity component were netted with the equity component in additional paid-in capital. Additionally, the Company recorded a deferred tax liability of $51.1 million in connection with the Notes. The Notes consisted of the following (in thousands): ##TABLE_START   As of January 31,    2011   2010  Equity component (1)  $ 125,530   $ 125,530          Liability component :   Principal  $ 575,000   $ 575,000  Less: debt discount, net (2)   (102,462 )   (124,802 )         Net carrying amount  $ 472,538   $ 450,198          ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START (1) Included in the consolidated balance sheets within additional paid-in capital, net of the $1.8 million in equity issuance costs. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START (2) Included in the consolidated balance sheets within 0.75% convertible senior notes and is amortized over the remaining life of the Notes using the effective interest rate method. ##TABLE_END As of January 31, 2011, the remaining life of the Notes is approximately 4 years. The following table sets forth total interest expense recognized related to the Notes prior to capitalization of interest (in thousands): ##TABLE_START   Fiscal Year Ended January 31,    2011   2010  Contractual interest expense  $ 4,313   $ 144  Amortization of debt issuance costs   1,324    59  Amortization of debt discount   22,396    728           $ 28,033   $ 931          Effective interest rate of the liability component   5.86 %   5.86 % ##TABLE_END Note Hedges To minimize the impact of potential economic dilution upon conversion of the Notes, the Company entered into convertible note hedge transactions with respect to its common stock (the Note Hedges). The Company paid, in January 2010, an aggregate amount of $126.5 million for the Note Hedges. The Note Hedges cover, approximately 6.7 million shares of the Companys common stock at a strike price that corresponds to the initial conversion price of the Notes, also subject to adjustment, and are exercisable upon conversion of the Notes. The Note Hedges will expire upon the maturity of the Notes. The Note Hedges are intended to reduce the potential economic dilution upon conversion of the Notes in the event that the market value per share of the Companys common stock, as measured under the Notes, at the time of exercise is greater than the conversion price of the  Notes. The Note Hedges are separate transactions and are not part of the terms of the Notes. Holders of the Notes will not have any rights with respect to the Note Hedges. The Company in January 2010 recorded a deferred tax asset of $51.4 million in connection with these Note Hedges. Warrants Separately, the Company in January 2010 also entered into warrant transactions (the Warrants), whereby the Company sold warrants to acquire, subject to anti-dilution adjustments, up to 6.7 million shares of the Companys common stock at a strike price of $119.51 per share. The Company received aggregate proceeds of $59.2 million from the sale of the Warrants. If the average market value per share of the Companys common stock for the reporting period, as measured under the Warrants, exceeds the strike price of the Warrants, the Warrants will have a dilutive effect on the Companys earnings per share. The Warrants are separate transactions, entered into by the Company and are not part of the terms of the Notes or Note Hedges. Holders of the Notes and Note Hedges will not have any rights with respect to the Warrants. 3. Stockholders Equity Stock Options Issued to Employees The Company maintains three stock plans; the 2004 Equity Incentive Plan, 2004 Employee Stock Purchase Plan and the 2004 Outside Directors Stock Plan. These plans, other than the 2004 Outside Directors Stock Plan, provide for annual automatic increases on February 1 to the shares reserved for issuance based on the lesser of (i) a specific percentage of the total number of shares outstanding at year end; (ii) a fixed number of shares; or (iii) a lesser number of shares set by the Companys Board of Directors, all as specified in the respective plans. The expiration of the 1999 Stock Option Plan in fiscal 2010 did not affect awards outstanding, which continue to be governed by the terms and conditions of the 1999 Plan. On February 1, 2011, 3.5 million additional shares were reserved under the 2004 Equity Incentive Plan pursuant to the automatic increase. The 2004 Employee Stock Purchase Plan will not be implemented unless and until the Companys Board of Directors authorizes the commencement of one or more offerings under the plan. No offering periods have been authorized to date. In April 2006, the Companys Board of Directors approved the 2006 Inducement Equity Incentive Plan (the Inducement Plan) that allows for stock option and other equity incentive grants to employees in connection with merger or acquisition activity. In fiscal 2011, the Board of Directors amended the Inducement Plan to increase the share reserve by 300,000 shares to 1,000,000 shares in total. As of January 31, 2011, there were 362,102 shares of common stock available for grant under the Inducement Plan. Prior to February 1, 2006, options issued under the Companys stock option plans were generally for periods which had a term of 10 years. After February 1, 2006, options issued have a term of 5 years.  Stock activity is as follows: ##TABLE_START   Shares Available for Grant   Options Outstanding     Outstanding Stock Options   Weighted- Average Exercise Price   Aggregate Intrinsic Value (in thousands)  Balance as of January 31, 2010   4,607,929    14,036,371   $ 40.36   Increase in shares authorized:     2004 Equity Incentive Plan   3,500,000    0    0   Inducement Plan   300,000    0    0   Options granted under all plans   (3,113,276 )   3,113,276    128.33   Restricted stock activity   (1,775,505 )   0    0   Stock grants to board and advisory board members   (50,200 )   0    0   Exercised   0    (4,646,977 )   34.52   1999 Plan shares expired   (92,999 )   0    0   Cancelled   719,511    (719,511 )   49.38                Balance as of January 31, 2011   4,095,460    11,783,159   $ 65.35   $ 782,437                  Vested or expected to vest    11,358,774   $ 64.42   $ 763,923               Exercisable as of January 31, 2011    4,340,782   $ 36.32   $ 402,892               ##TABLE_END The total intrinsic value of the options exercised during the fiscal 2011, 2010, and 2009 were $322.5 million, $105.2 million, and $117.3 million, respectively. The intrinsic value is the difference of the current market value of the stock and the exercise price of the stock option. The weighted-average remaining contractual life of vested and expected to vest options is approximately 3.3 years. As of January 31, 2011, options to purchase 4,340,782 shares were vested at a weighted average exercise price of $36.32 per share and a remaining weighted-average remaining contractual life of approximately 2.6 years. The total intrinsic value of these vested options as of January 31, 2011 was $402.9 million. The following table summarizes information about stock options outstanding as of January 31, 2011: ##TABLE_START   Options Outstanding   Options Exercisable  Range of Exercise Prices  Number Outstanding   Weighted- Average Remaining Contractual Life (Years)   Weighted- Average Exercise Price   Number of Shares   Weighted- Average Exercise Price  $0.75 to $25.19   1,054,480    3.2   $ 10.29    1,054,480   $ 10.29  $25.97   2,195,260    2.8    25.97    848,361    25.97  $27.20 to $52.48   2,309,582    2.0    45.79    1,528,138    44.65  $52.76 to $65.41   669,778    2.5    56.09    321,878    55.38  $65.44   2,301,557    3.8    65.44    489,953    65.44  $65.68 to $133.32   957,126    4.0    84.78    97,972    68.15  $142.50 to $148.49   2,295,376    4.8    142.52    0    0               11,783,159    3.3   $ 65.35    4,340,782   $ 36.32             ##TABLE_END  Restricted stock activity is as follows: ##TABLE_START   Restricted Stock Outstanding    Outstanding   Weighted- Average Exercise Price   Aggregate Intrinsic Value (in thousands)  Balance as of January 31, 2009   2,499,151   $ 0.001   Granted   859,636    0.001   Cancelled   (212,774 )   0.001   Vested and converted to shares   (829,561 )   0.001            Balance as of January 31, 2010   2,316,452    0.001   Granted   2,048,925    0.001   Cancelled   (223,220 )   0.001   Vested and converted to shares   (926,054 )   0.001            Balance as of January 31, 2011   3,216,103   $ 0.001   $ 415,328           Expected to vest   2,979,791    $ 384,810        ##TABLE_END The restricted stock, which upon vesting entitles the holder to one share of common stock for each share of restricted stock, has an exercise price of $0.001 per share, which is equal to the par value of the Companys common stock, and vest over 4 years. The weighed-average fair value of the restricted stock issued in fiscal 2011 and 2010 was $108.03 and $47.59, respectively. The Company reduced its income taxes payable by the tax benefit realized from the exercise, sale or vesting of the stock options or similar instruments during fiscal 2011 in the amount of $76.1 million. Cash provided by financing activities due to excess tax benefits from employee stock plans was a result of a portion of such cash tax benefit and the tax benefit arising from the utilization of net operating losses generated primarily from the settlement of stock awards in prior years. Common Stock The following number of shares of common stock were reserved and available for future issuance at January 31, 2011: ##TABLE_START Options outstanding   11,783,159  Restricted stock awards and units outstanding   3,216,103  Stock available for future grant:  2004 Equity Incentive Plan   3,122,358  2006 Inducement Equity Incentive Plan   362,102  2004 Employee Stock Purchase Plan   1,000,000  2004 Outside Directors Stock Plan   611,000  0.75% Convertible senior notes   6,735,953  Warrants   6,735,953        33,566,628      ##TABLE_END During fiscal year 2011 and 2010, certain board members received stock grants totaling 48,000 shares of common stock, respectively for board services pursuant to the terms described in the 2004 Outside Directors Stock Plan. The expense related to these awards, which was expensed immediately at the time of the issuance, totaled $4.9 million and $2.2 million, in fiscal 2011 and 2010 respectively.  4. Preferred Stock The Companys board of directors has the authority, without further action by stockholders, to issue up to 5,000,000 shares of preferred stock in one or more series. The Companys board of directors may designate the rights, preferences, privileges and restrictions of the preferred stock, including dividend rights, conversion rights, voting rights, terms of redemption, liquidation preference, sinking fund terms, and number of shares constituting any series or the designation of any series. The issuance of preferred stock could have the effect of restricting dividends on the Companys common stock, diluting the voting power of its common stock, impairing the liquidation rights of its common stock, or delaying or preventing a change in control. The ability to issue preferred stock could delay or impede a change in control. At January 31, 2011 and 2010, no shares of preferred stock were outstanding. 5. Joint Venture In December 2000, the Company established a Japanese joint venture, Kabushiki Kaisha salesforce.com, (Salesforce Japan), with SunBridge, Inc., a Japanese corporation, to assist the Company with its sales efforts in Japan. During fiscal 2011, the Company paid $172.0 million to acquire SunBridges and other shareholders interest in Salesforce Japan. The Company now owns 100 percent of Salesforce Japan. As a result of the Companys purchase of the shares held by SunBridge, the joint venture agreement terminated according to its terms. The purchase transaction, including transaction-related fees totaling $1.1 million, were accounted for as a reduction to additional paid-in capital and noncontrolling interest. 6. Acquisitions in fiscal year 2011 Jigsaw Data Corporation In May 2010 the Company acquired for cash the stock of Jigsaw Data Corporation (Jigsaw), a cloud provider of crowd-sourced data services in the cloud. The Company acquired Jigsaw to combine the Companys CRM applications and enterprise cloud platform with Jigsaws cloud-based model for the automation of acquiring, completing and cleansing business contact data. The Company has included the financial results of Jigsaw in the consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisition. The total cash consideration for Jigsaw was approximately $148.5 million. In addition, the Company will potentially make additional payments (contingent consideration) totaling up to $14.4 million in cash, based on the achievement of certain billings targets related to Jigsaws services for the one-year period from May 8, 2010 through May 7, 2011. The estimated fair value using a discounted cash flow model of the contingent consideration at May 7, 2010 was $13.4 million and is included in the total purchase price. The Company has recorded and will record the fair value of the contingent consideration each reporting period based on Jigsaws achievement of meeting its billing targets as it relates to the contingent consideration. The Companys estimated fair value of the contingent consideration at January 31, 2011 was $14.1 million. The change in fair value of contingent consideration is recorded in general and administrative expenses. The total preliminary purchase price and the fair value of the contingent consideration was allocated to the net tangible and intangible assets based upon their fair values as of May 7, 2010 as set forth below. The excess of the preliminary purchase price over the net tangible and intangible assets was recorded as goodwill. The following table summarizes the estimated fair values of the assets and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date. The primary areas of the preliminary purchase price allocation that are not yet finalized relate to both current and noncurrent deferred tax liabilities which are subject to change, pending the finalization of certain tax returns. ##TABLE_START (in thousands)    Net tangible assets  $ 4,347  Intangible assets   28,140  Deferred tax liability   (3,864 ) Goodwill   133,254      Total purchase price  $ 161,877      ##TABLE_END  The following table sets forth the components of intangible assets acquired in connection with the Jigsaw acquisition: ##TABLE_START (in thousands)  Fair value   Useful Life  Developed service technology and database  $ 23,560    3 years  Customer relationships   2,440    5 years  Trade name and trademark   2,140    3 years       Total intangible assets subject to amortization  $ 28,140        ##TABLE_END Customer relationships represent the fair values of the underlying relationships and agreements with Jigsaws customers. Developed service technology and database represents the fair values of the Jigsaw technology and database that contains the business contact data. Trade name and trademark represents the fair values of brand and name recognition associated with the marketing of Jigsaws services. The goodwill balance is not deductible for tax purposes. The goodwill balance is primarily attributable to Jigsaws assembled workforce and the expected synergies and revenue opportunities when combining the business contact data within the Jigsaw solution with the Companys CRM cloud applications. The fair value of intangible assets was based on the income approach. The acquisition costs which were expensed were not material. Heroku, Inc. In January 2011 the Company acquired for cash the stock of Heroku, Inc. (Heroku), a platform-as-a-service cloud vendor, built to work in an open environment and take advantage of the Ruby language. Ruby has become one of the leading development languages used for applications that are social, collaborative and deliver real-time access to information across mobile devices. The Company has included the financial results of Heroku in the consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisition. The total cash consideration for Heroku was approximately $216.7 million. The total preliminary purchase price was allocated to the net tangible and intangible assets and liabilities based upon their fair values as of January 3, 2011 as set forth below. The excess of the preliminary purchase price over the net tangible and intangible assets was recorded as goodwill. The following table summarizes the estimated fair values of the assets and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date. The primary areas of the preliminary purchase price allocation that are not yet finalized relate to both current and noncurrent deferred tax liabilities which are subject to change, pending the finalization of certain tax returns. ##TABLE_START (in thousands)    Net tangible assets  $ 5,411  Intangible assets   40,060  Deferred tax liability   (10,060 ) Goodwill   181,304      Total purchase price  $ 216,715      ##TABLE_END The following table sets forth the components of intangible assets acquired in connection with the Heroku acquisition: ##TABLE_START (in thousands)  Fair value   Useful life  Developed technology  $ 39,280    3 years  Trade name and trademark   780    3 years       Total intangible assets subject to amortization  $ 40,060        ##TABLE_END  Developed product technology represents the fair value of the Heroku platform technology. Trade name and trademark represents the fair values of brand and name recognition associated with the marketing of Herokus services. The goodwill balance is not deductible for tax purposes. The goodwill balance is primarily attributable to Herokus assembled workforce and the Companys ability to now access a large community of developers and independent software vendors (ISVs) who are building applications in the cloud using the Ruby language. Additionally, the goodwill balance also reflects the value of expanded market share opportunities that are expected to occur when combining the Companys cloud platform with Herokus platform and enhancing the joint platform to allow developers and ISVs the freedom to choose among a variety of programming languages. The fair value of intangible assets was based on the cost approach using a replacement cost method to value the developed technology. The replacement cost method estimates the fair value based upon an estimate of the costs that would be incurred to replace the developed technology. The acquisition costs which were expensed were not material. DimDim, Inc. In January 2011 the Company acquired for cash the stock of DimDim, Inc. (DimDim), a provider of online meeting solutions for business collaboration. The Company has included the financial results of DimDim in the consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisition. The total cash consideration for DimDim was approximately $37.1 million. The total preliminary purchase price was allocated to the net tangible and intangible assets based upon their fair values as of January 6, 2011 as set forth below. The excess of the preliminary purchase price over the net tangible and intangible assets was recorded as goodwill. The following table summarizes the estimated fair values of the assets and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date. The primary areas of the preliminary purchase price allocation that are not yet finalized relate to both current and noncurrent deferred tax liabilities which are subject to change, pending the finalization of certain tax returns. ##TABLE_START (in thousands)    Net tangible assets  $ 1,951  Developed technology   14,450  Deferred tax liability   (2,648 ) Goodwill   23,373      Total purchase price  $ 37,126      ##TABLE_END The developed technology acquired in connection with the DimDim acquisition represents the fair value of the developed technology. The goodwill balance is not deductible for tax purposes. The goodwill balance is primarily attributable to DimDims assembled workforce and the expected synergies and expanded market leadership opportunities when integrating DimDims on-line meeting solution technology with the Companys collaboration cloud offering. The fair value of intangible assets was based on the income approach. The acquisition costs which were expensed were not material. Other Acquisitions During fiscal 2011, the Company acquired three privately-held companies for $18.1 million in aggregate cash and $2.8 million in contingent consideration. The Company accounted for these transactions as business combinations. Of the $20.9 million, the Company allocated $10.0 million to acquired intangible assets with useful lives of 3 to 5 years and $10.3 million to goodwill. The goodwill balances are not deductible for tax purposes. These transactions were not material, individually or in aggregate.  Intangible assets acquired resulting from the acquisitions described above as of January 31, 2011 are as follows (in thousands): ##TABLE_START   Gross Fair Value   Accumulated Amortization   Net Book Value   Weighted Average Remaining Useful Life  Acquired developed technology  $ 86,710   $ (9,324 )  $ 77,386    2.7 years  Customer relationships   2,990    (412 )   2,578    4.3 years  Trade name and trademark   2,920    (557 )   2,363    2.4 years                $ 92,620   $ (10,293 )  $ 82,327                ##TABLE_END The expected future amortization expense for these intangible assets for each of the fiscal years ended thereafter is as follows (in thousands): ##TABLE_START Fiscal Period:  Fiscal 2012  $ 30,475  Fiscal 2013   30,475  Fiscal 2014   20,598  Fiscal 2015   598  Fiscal 2016   181      Total amortization expense  $ 82,327      ##TABLE_END Pro forma results of operations have not been presented because the effect of the acquisitions individually or in the aggregate were not significant. 7.

Significant components of the Companys deferred tax assets and liabilities were as follows (in thousands): ##TABLE_START   As of January 31,    2011   2010  Deferred tax assets:   Net operating loss carryforwards  $ 21,929   $ 5,284  Deferred stock compensation   31,872    30,451  Tax credits   39,065    20,836  Deferred rent expense   8,371    7,360  Accrued liabilities   29,549    22,006  Deferred revenue   9,727    10,802  Other   4,508    4,798          Total deferred tax assets   145,021    101,537  Less valuation allowance   (1,142 )   (1,540 )         Net deferred tax assets   143,879    99,997  Deferred tax liabilities:   Deferred commissions   (27,739 )   (22,613 ) Purchased intangibles   (24,856 )   (3,280 ) Unrealized gains on investments   (5,005 )   (3,873 ) Depreciation and amortization   (13,500 )   (229 ) Other   (4,064 )   (2,307 )         Total deferred tax liabilities   (75,164 )   (32,302 )         Net deferred tax assets  $ 68,715   $ 67,695          ##TABLE_END Realization of deferred tax assets is dependent on future earnings, if any, the timing and amount of which are uncertain. Accordingly, the deferred tax assets have been partially offset by a valuation allowance. The valuation allowance relates to net deferred tax assets from operating losses of certain foreign subsidiaries. The excess tax benefits associated with stock option exercises are recorded directly to stockholders equity controlling interest only when realized. As a result, the excess tax benefits included in net operating loss carryforwards but not reflected in deferred tax assets for fiscal year 2011 and 2010 are $80.6 million and $8.5 million, respectively.  At January 31, 2011, the Company had net operating loss carryforwards for federal income tax purposes of approximately $257.6 million, which expire in 2024 through 2031, federal research and development tax credits of approximately $25.8 million, which expire in 2020 through 2031, foreign tax credits of $3.6 million, which expires in 2019, and minimum tax credits of $0.7 million, which have no expiration date. The Company also has state net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $308.5 million which expire beginning in 2013 and state research and development tax credits of approximately $21.8 million and $4.0 million of state enterprise zone tax credits, which do not expire. Utilization of the Companys net operating loss carryforwards may be subject to substantial annual limitation due to the ownership change limitations provided by the Internal Revenue Code and similar state provisions. Such an annual limitation could result in the expiration of the net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards before utilization. The Company had gross unrecognized tax benefits of $27.5 million and $22.1 million as of January 31, 2011 and January 31, 2010 respectively. A reconciliation of the beginning and ending balance of total unrecognized tax benefits for fiscal years 2011, 2010, and 2009 is as follows (in thousands): ##TABLE_START   Fiscal Year Ended January 31,    2011   2010   2009  Balance as of February 1,  $ 22,053   $ 16,472   $ 11,771  Tax positions taken in prior period:    Gross increases   41    457    17  Gross decreases   (811 )   (707 )   (148 ) Tax positions taken in current period:    Gross increases   8,047    5,401    5,955  Settlements   (39 )   (212 )   (149 ) Lapse of statute of limitations   (1,741 )   0    0  Currency translation effect   (88 )   642    (974 )             Balance as of January 31,  $ 27,462   $ 22,053   $ 16,472              ##TABLE_END For fiscal year 2011, 2010, and 2009 total unrecognized tax benefits in an amount of $20.4 million, $16.5 million and $11.8 million respectively, if recognized, would reduce income tax expense and the Companys effective tax rate. The Company recognizes interest accrued and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in the income tax provision. The Company accrued no penalties and an immaterial amount of interest in income tax expense for fiscal 2011, 2010 and 2009. Tax positions for the Company and its subsidiaries are subject to income tax audits by many tax jurisdictions throughout the world. The Companys U.S. federal and state tax returns for all tax years since February 1999, which was the inception of the Company, remain open to examination. With few exceptions, all tax years in most major jurisdictions, including Canada, United Kingdom and Australia, remain open for examinations, while Japan is open for examinations only for years after 2004. During the fiscal year ended January 31, 2011, the National Tax Agency of Japan completed the examination of the Companys fiscal 2010 tax return for Japan. No material adjustment was made as a result of the examination. Management does not believe that it is reasonably possible that the estimates of unrecognized tax benefits will change significantly in the next twelve months. However, an adverse resolution of one or more uncertain tax positions in any period could have a material impact on the results of operations for that period.  8. Commitments Letters of Credit As of January 31, 2011, the Company had a total of $8.9 million in letters of credit outstanding substantially in favor of certain landlords for office space. These letters of credit renew annually and mature at various dates through September 2021. Leases The Company leases office space and equipment under non-cancelable operating and capital leases with various expiration dates. As of January 31, 2011, the future minimum lease payments under non-cancelable operating and capital leases are as follows (in thousands): ##TABLE_START   Capital Leases   Operating Leases  Fiscal Period:   Fiscal 2012  $ 11,503   $ 107,343  Fiscal 2013   5,818    101,527  Fiscal 2014   2,292    79,074  Fiscal 2015   0    47,126  Fiscal 2016   0    44,423  Thereafter   0    119,791          Total minimum lease payments   19,613   $ 499,284       Less: amount representing interest   (976 )       Present value of capital lease obligation  $ 18,637        ##TABLE_END The terms of the lease agreements provide for rental payments on a graduated basis. The Company recognizes rent expense on the straight-line basis over the lease period and has accrued for rent expense incurred but not paid. Of the total operating lease commitment balance of $499.3 million, $436.9 million is related to facilities space. The remaining $62.3 million commitment is related to computer equipment and other leases. The Companys agreements for the facilities and certain services provide the Company with the option to renew. The Companys future contractual obligations would change if the Company exercised these options. Rent expense for fiscal 2011, 2010 and 2009 was $52.8 million, $47.3 million and $36.0 million, respectively. 9. Legal Proceedings The Company is involved in various legal proceedings arising from the normal course of business activities, including claims of alleged infringement of third-party patents and other intellectual property rights, commercial, employment and other matters. The Company makes a provision for a liability related to legal proceedings when it is both probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. These provisions are reviewed at least quarterly and adjusted to reflect the impacts of negotiations, settlements, rulings, advice of legal counsel and other information and events pertaining to a particular case. In managements opinion, resolution of these matters is not expected to have a material adverse impact on the Companys consolidated results of operations, cash flows or financial position. However, depending on the nature and timing of any such dispute, an unfavorable resolution of a matter could materially affect the Companys future results of operations or cash flows or both.  Many of the Companys subscription agreements require the Company to indemnify its customers for third-party intellectual property infringement claims, which could increase the cost to the Company of an adverse ruling on such a claim. Any adverse determination related to intellectual property claims or litigation could prevent the Company from offering its service to others, could be material to the Companys net income or cash flows or both or could otherwise adversely affect the Companys operating results. 10. Employee Benefit Plan The Company has a 401(k) plan covering all eligible employees in the United States. Since January 1, 2006, the Company has been contributing to the plan. Total Company contributions during fiscal 2011, 2010 and 2009, were $11.0 million, $8.5 million and $6.7 million, respectively. 11. Related-Party Transactions In January 1999, the salesforce.com/foundation, also referred to as the Foundation, a non-profit public charity, was chartered to build philanthropic programs that are focused on youth and technology. The Companys chairman is the chairman of the Foundation. He, one of the Companys employees and one of the Companys board members hold three of the Foundations seven board seats. The Company is not the primary beneficiary of the Foundations activities, and accordingly, the Company does not consolidate the Foundations statement of activities with its financial results. Since the Foundations inception, the Company has provided at no charge certain resources to Foundation employees such as office space. The value of these items were in excess of $90,000 per quarter during fiscal year 2011. In addition to the resource sharing with the Foundation, the Company issued the Foundation warrants in August 2002 to purchase shares of the Companys common stock. All of the warrants were exercised in prior years. As of January 31, 2011, the Foundation held 121,000 shares of salesforce.com common stock. Additionally, the Company has donated subscriptions to the Companys service to other qualified non-profit organizations. The Company also allows an affiliate of the Foundation to resell the Companys service to large non-profit organizations. The Company does not charge the affiliate for the subscriptions. The fair value of these and the subscriptions were in excess of $3.6 million per month during fiscal 2011. The Company currently plans to continue these programs.  12.

CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES ##TABLE_END (a) Evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act), as of the end of the period covered by this report (the Evaluation Date). In designing and evaluating our disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any disclosure controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. In addition, the design of disclosure controls and procedures must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and that management is required to apply its judgment in evaluating the benefits of possible controls and procedures relative to their costs. Based on managements evaluation, our chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are designed to, and are effective to, provide assurance at a reasonable level that the information we are required to disclose in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in Securities and Exchange Commission rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. (b) Managements Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f). Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of January 31, 2011 based on the guidelines established in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). Our internal control over financial reporting includes policies and procedures that provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external reporting purposes in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Based on the results of our evaluation, our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of January 31, 2011. We reviewed the results of managements assessment with our Audit Committee. The effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of January 31, 2011 has been audited by Ernst  Young LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in its report which is included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. (c) Changes in internal control over financial reporting There was no change in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended January 31, 2011 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.  (d) Inherent Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls Our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, do not expect that our disclosure controls or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the Company have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty, and that breakdowns can occur because of a simple error or mistake. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people or by management override of the controls. The design of any system of controls also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions; over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or the degree of compliance with policies or procedures may deteriorate. Because of the inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected. ##TABLE_START ", "9B": " ITEM 9B.

BUSINESS ##TABLE_END Overview We are a leading provider of enterprise cloud computing and social enterprise solutions, and are dedicated to helping customers transform themselves into social enterprises. Social enterprises leverage social, mobile and open technologies to engage and collaborate with their customers and employees in new and powerful ways. Our technologies are targeted at businesses of all sizes and industries worldwide. We were incorporated in Delaware in February 1999, and founded on the simple concept of delivering customer relationship management, or CRM, applications via the Internet or cloud. Cloud computing refers to the use of Internet-based computing, storage and connectivity technology to deliver a variety of different services. We introduced our first CRM service in February 2000. Since then, primarily through development and to a lesser extent acquisition, we have augmented our CRM service with new editions, services and enhanced features. In recent years, we have seen a broad shift in the information technology (IT) industry to social networking and the use of mobile devices. Industry analysts describe how social networking users have surpassed the total number of email users, how consumers are spending the majority of their time on the Internet using social websites, and how more people are browsing the Internet on mobile devices than on desktop computers. In fiscal 2012, to address this shift to social networking, we began to describe to companies of all sizes the benefits of becoming a social enterprise and how our service offerings could accelerate their transformation into becoming a social enterprise.  We have designed, developed and acquired applications and platforms that are easy-to-use and intuitive, that can be deployed rapidly, customized easily and integrated with other enterprise applications or platforms. We deliver our service through all of the market-leading Internet browsers and mobile devices. Customers who use our social enterprise applications and platforms are able to avoid much of the expense and complexity of traditional enterprise software development and implementations. As a result, our customers face less risk and lower upfront implementation and ongoing costs, and benefit from increased productivity and efficiency. We market our social enterprise applications and platforms to businesses on a subscription basis, primarily through our direct sales efforts and to a lesser extent indirectly through partners. Through our platforms and other developer tools, we also encourage third parties to develop additional functionality and new applications that run on our platforms, but which are sold separately from, or in conjunction with, our social enterprise solution. Our principal executive offices are located in San Francisco, California and our principal website address is www.salesforce.com . Our office address is The Landmark @ One Market, Suite 300, San Francisco, California 94105. Cloud Computing Cloud computing changes the way enterprise business applications are developed and deployed. Application developers no longer need to create and manage their own infrastructure of servers, storage, network devices, operating system software and development tools in order to create a business application. Instead, the entire infrastructure is managed by third parties who specialize in infrastructure management, and developers simply use an Internet browser to access the development environment. Application users can gain access to a variety of business applications via an Internet browser or mobile device on an as-needed basis, and are able to take advantage of a robust, secure, scalable and highly available application, with few or no implementation services required and without the cost and complexity of managing the hardware or software infrastructure in-house. Historically, only large businesses could afford to make investments in enterprise resource planning, and sales, marketing and service applications to gain an enterprise-wide view of business information and automate and improve basic processes. Today, cloud applications are available to businesses of all sizes and across all industries because third parties manage the infrastructure. Our vision of enterprise cloud computing is based on a multi-tenant technology architecture, which enables cloud vendors like us to leverage a common infrastructure and software code base across all of our customers who benefit from access to the most current release of an application, periodic upgrades, more rapid innovation and the economies of a shared infrastructure. In recent years, we have seen a shift from traditional enterprise software to enterprise cloud computing. We believe this shift to cloud computing provides significant benefits even beyond those associated with multi-tenant infrastructure. Businesses are able to realize many of the benefits offered by traditional enterprise software vendors, such as a comprehensive set of features and functionality and the ability to customize and integrate with other applications, while at the same time reducing the risks and lowering the total costs associated with owning enterprise software. As a result, we believe the continued emergence of cloud applications is bringing about a fundamental transformation in the enterprise software industry as businesses are offered the choice of replacing their purchased software with subscriptions to a wide range of application services. We believe that cloud applications and their related success in the market are the most widely understood segment of enterprise cloud computing. However, enterprise cloud computing also includes building new applications on a cloud-based application development platform, also referred to as cloud platforms. Application developers use cloud platform technology to build both custom applications for individual businesses or vertical industries, and horizontal applications to address standard business processes that can be sold to a broad range of potential customers. Application developers include corporate IT departments that typically develop applications for a companys internal-use and independent software vendors (ISVs) that develop applications to sell to customers. Traditionally, these developers have needed to purchase, install, test  and maintain complex software and hardware infrastructure to develop and deliver their applications. This requirement resulted in more time and resources being spent maintaining infrastructure and less time and resources being available to develop applications, with a resulting reduction in innovation and productivity levels. Cloud platforms enable corporate IT developers and ISVs to leverage the benefits of a multi-tenant platform for developing new applications. Cloud platforms allow developers to build applications using only a browser and an Internet connection, just as cloud applications allow users to use applications through a browser. In addition, developers typically pay no upfront costs when building cloud applications, with costs only to be incurred at the point of application deployment. The Social Enterprise We believe that the next phase of cloud computing is again transforming enterprise software. Driven by the consumerization of IT, the next phase of cloud computing will have three key characteristics  it will be social, mobile and open. With the popularity of social networking websites, new ways to communicate and collaborate based on feeds and status updates have emerged. In the enterprise market, that means enabling employees, customers and partners to easily find, share and collaborate around information and business processes. In addition, with the wide adoption of mobile phones and tablets, customers now expect cloud computing technologies to work on these devices, fully leveraging functionality such as touch-screens, regardless of the carrier or operating system. Customers are increasingly focused on open standards, which enable developers to easily integrate our solution with applications and technology from other vendors, and we offer a Web services application programming interface (API) for programmatic access and integration. We call this the social enterprise, and we help our customers embrace the opportunities and meet the challenges it poses to businesses. We believe that companies must change the way they collaborate, communicate and share information with customers, employees and partners to stay competitive. Our solution helps companies transform themselves into social enterprises by: ##TABLE_START    Creating customer social profiles : As users continue to adopt social technologies in their personal lives, they are coming to expect the same experience, communication features and benefits from business applications. Users want the business equivalents of liking on Facebook, tweeting on Twitter, and connecting on LinkedIn. In the social enterprise, a social customer profile captures all of this publicly available information, empowering every employee to support customers by knowing who they are and delivering a new and comprehensive level of service and experience. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    Creating employee social networks : Many companies struggle to connect their employees with the best information and experts within their own company. Utilizing social features popularized by Facebook and Twitter  such as profiles, status updates and real-time feeds  employees can follow documents, people, business processes and application data. As a result, information is delivered directly to users, rather than making them search for it themselves. Companies can build private employee social networks that help employees rapidly collaborate across their company so they can engage, sell and service customers more effectively. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    Creating customer social networks : Customer social networks allow companies to build stronger relationships with their customers on todays most popular social channels. Companies can listen to, engage with and analyze what people are saying about them and create applications through which customers can interact with their brand. These applications utilize social and mobile technology, can be location-aware, and can be accessed from any device. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    Product and partner social networks : In addition to customer social networks, social enterprises can also bring their products and partners into these networks. For example, businesses can provide real-time information to their customers about products, such as service needs or updates. In addition, ##TABLE_END  ##TABLE_START  partners are able to connect directly with customers through the same channels, thereby providing a consistent customer user experience. ##TABLE_END Our solution is comprised of cloud applications and cloud platforms, as well as professional services to facilitate the adoption of our solution. Our Cloud Applications for the Social Enterprise We are a leading provider of enterprise cloud computing services, and are dedicated to helping customers transform themselves into social enterprises with our applications. Our primary applications are within our Sales Cloud and Service Cloud brands, but the combination of all the applications below allows our customers to transform themselves by connecting, engaging, selling, servicing, and collaborating with customers as well as improving internal automation and collaboration. Our primary applications are as follows: ##TABLE_START    Sales Cloud. The sales force automation features of our CRM application services are marketed under our Sales Cloud brand and focus on allowing our customers to better connect and sell to their customers. Through the Sales Cloud, users are able to be more productive through the automation of manual and repetitive tasks and access to better and more organized data about their current customers and prospects. Our customers are also able to establish a system and process for recording, tracking, and sharing information about sales opportunities, sales leads, sales forecasts, the sales process, and closed business, as well as managing sales territories. Customers are able to create social profiles of their customers, based on information from social networking services like Facebook, Twitter and LinkedIn. Our customers are also better able to manage unstructured information such as sales collateral, presentations, price lists, and video assets. In addition, the Sales Cloud encompasses partner relationship management functionality (including channel management and partner portals) and marketing automation (including campaigns, and return-on-investment tracking). ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    Service Cloud. Our customer service and support automation features are marketed under our Service Cloud brand and allow our customers to better service and engage with their customers. Through the Service Cloud, companies are able to maintain better relationships with their existing customers and more efficiently address a variety of service and support needs, such as advice about products and services, requests for repairs, complaints about faulty goods, and the need for additional goods and services. Using the Service Cloud, companies can access a comprehensive solution for their customer service interactions across every service channel: call centers with phone, email, and chat; Web portals for self-service and customer collaboration; and community interactions within social networks. In addition, built-in collaboration tools enable customer service agents to share information on how to better service customers. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    Salesforce Chatter. Our Chatter application enables customers to create private employee social networks for companies of all sizes in order to improve employee collaboration. For current customers of our Sales and Service Cloud editions, Chatter is included free for all subscribers. In addition, we offer Chatter Plus edition, designed to provide access to Chatter for employees in customers organizations who are not current subscribers of a Sales or Service Cloud edition. We recently delivered new features, including Chatter Now for real-time collaboration, and Chatter Customer Groups enabling users to invite people outside their organizations, such as customers and partners, into their Chatter network to collaborate in a secure environment. Chatter is a core attribute of our Force.com platform and its social capabilities are an integral part of each of our application offerings and our Social Enterprise solution. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    Salesforce Radian6. Our Radian6 application provides our customers a tool for social media monitoring and marketing. The application allows companies to listen, analyze, engage and measure their brands presence within social media. As a result, companies can better service their customers by listening to what their customers are saying about their brand online, and interacting and influencing conversations in real-time. For example, companies are able to measure the effectiveness of marketing ##TABLE_END  ##TABLE_START  campaigns, respond quickly and effectively in times of crisis, or even generate new customer leads through integration with our sales and service cloud applications. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    Salesforce Data.com. We provide companies with a database of high-quality business contacts, company profiles and social insights. Delivered as a service, data.com integrates with our applications to provide the business data that helps companies increase their pipeline of sales leads and to improve engagement with existing customers. ##TABLE_END Our Cloud Platforms for the Social Enterprise Our cloud platforms provide application developers access to new capabilities that can be built into their business applications. These platforms include features popularized by social networking companies, such as profiles, status updates and feeds; and also the capability to extend applications for use on mobile devices. In addition, they run on our Database.com offering, an open enterprise database built for social and mobile computing. Our cloud platforms allow both IT departments and ISV developers to use several programming languages to build their applications. Developers are able to use the most popular programming languages on our cloud platforms, such as Java and Ruby, to build their applications, and our cloud platforms support multiple other languages to provide developers openness and choice. We have two platform offerings: Force.com and Heroku, and offer additional developer tools such as Database.com and the AppExchange. The details of these offerings are as follows: ##TABLE_START    The Force.com Platform . The Force.com cloud computing platform provides a feature set and technology environment for building business applications, including data models and objects to manage data, a workflow engine for managing collaboration of data between users, a user interface model to handle forms and other interactions, and a Web services API for programmatic access and integration. The Force.com platform provides the tools and infrastructure required to: ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    deploy our applications; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    customize and integrate existing enterprise software applications; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    create and deploy new business applications that are pre-integrated with our service and leverage the same user interface or customize the user interface specific to customer requirements; and ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    sample and deploy applications built by third parties from the AppExchange. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    Heroku Platform . Heroku is a leading cloud platform for application developers to build and deploy social and mobile applications. Built on open standards, Heroku supports multiple frameworks, databases, and languagesincluding Java and Ruby. Most application developers choose to build applications on Heroku because they can utilize their existing skillsets. And, because it is delivered as a service, application developers can be more efficient, dedicating their time to writing code, not managing servers and application deployment. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    Database.com . In 2010, we opened the multi-tenant database that underlies the Sales Cloud and Service Cloud applications to application developers so that they can more easily architect and build new mobile and social applications in the cloud. The service is open so it can be accessed using any language, any platform and any device. Database.com provides the functionality of a modern database, which must accommodate mobile devices and data generated by social media tools. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    The AppExchange. The AppExchange is an online directory that provides customers a way to browse, sample, share, and install applications developed on our Force.com platform. Partners and developers can offer their applications and services for a fee on the AppExchange directory. This directory gives our users a way to find and install applications to expand their use of the Force.com platform to areas that are complementary to our social enterprise solution. ##TABLE_END  Professional Services We offer consulting, deployment and training services to our customers to facilitate the adoption of our social enterprise services. We expanded our ability to provide these services to our customers in our acquisition of Model Metrics in December 2011. Consulting services consist of services such as business process mapping, project management services and guidance on best practices in using our service. Deployment services include systems integration, technical architecture and development, configuration and data conversion as well as developing and delivering customized education programs for our customers. Most of our consulting and deployment engagements are billed on a time and materials basis. We offer a number of traditional classroom and online educational classes that address topics such as deploying, using, administering and developing on our service. We also offer classes for our partners who deploy our service on behalf of our customers. We bill the traditional classroom and some of the online educational classes on a per person, per class basis. There is a selection of online educational classes available at no charge to customers that subscribe to our service. As the reach of our enterprise cloud computing services has grown, partners and other third-party consulting and professional service providers play an integral part in providing these services to our customers. Business Benefits of Using Our Solution The key advantages of our solution include: ##TABLE_START    Secure, private, scalable and reliable delivery platform. The delivery platform for our service has been designed to provide our customers with privacy and high levels of performance, reliability, and security. We have built, and continue to invest in, a comprehensive security infrastructure, including firewalls, intrusion detection systems, and encryption for transmissions over the Internet, which we monitor and test on a regular basis. We built and maintain a multi-tenant application architecture that has been designed to enable our service to scale securely, reliably, and cost-effectively. Our multi-tenant application architecture maintains the integrity and separation of customer data while still permitting all customers to use the same application functionality simultaneously. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    Rapid deployment. Our service can be deployed rapidly since our customers do not have to spend time procuring, installing or maintaining the servers, storage, networking equipment, security products, or other infrastructure hardware and software necessary to ensure a scalable and reliable service. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    Ease of integration. Our platforms are designed to enable IT professionals to integrate our service with existing applications quickly and seamlessly. Our platforms provide a set of APIs that enable customers and independent software developers to both integrate our service with existing third-party, custom, and legacy applications and write their own application services that integrate with our service. For example, many of our customers use the Force.com API to move customer-related data from custom-developed and legacy applications into our service on a periodic basis to provide greater visibility into their activities. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    High levels of user adoption . We have designed our service to be intuitive and easy to use. Since our service contains many tools and features recognizable to users of popular websites such as those of Amazon, Facebook, Google and Twitter, it has a more familiar user interface than typical enterprise applications. As a result, our users do not require substantial training on how to use and benefit from our service. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    Rapid development of applications using the Force.com and Heroku platforms . Our customers and third-party developers can develop applications rapidly because of the ease of use and the benefits of a multi-tenant platform. We provide the capability for business users to easily customize our applications to suit their specific needs, and also a variety of programming language support so developers can code complex applications spanning multiple business processes and deliver them to multiple mobile devices. ##TABLE_END  ##TABLE_START    Increasing innovation. By providing infrastructure and development environments on demand, we provide developers the opportunity to create new and innovative applications without having to invest in hardware and distribution. A developer with an idea for a new application can log on to our platforms, develop, test and support their system on Force.com or Heroku and make the application accessible for a fee to our customers. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    Lower total cost of ownership. We enable customers to achieve significant upfront savings relative to the traditional enterprise software model. Customers benefit from the predictability of their future costs since they pay for the service on a per subscriber basis for the term of the subscription contract. All upgrades are included in our service, so customers are not burdened or disrupted by the periodic need to perform system upgrades. Because we deploy all upgrades on our servers, new features and functionality automatically become part of our service on the release date and therefore benefit all of our customers immediately. ##TABLE_END Our Go-To-Market Strategy Our objective is to help companies put customers and employees at the center of their businesses and transform themselves into social enterprises by the use of our applications and platforms. Not only do we want to be the leading provider of the social enterprise solution, we also want to offer additional social applications and have the leading cloud computing platforms upon which our customers and partners build applications. Key elements of our strategy include: ##TABLE_START    Strengthening our existing Sales Cloud and Service Cloud applications and extending into new functional areas within the social enterprise. We designed our service to easily accommodate new features and functions. We intend to continue to add features and functions to our core service that we will make available to customers at no additional charge. We offer advanced editions for an additional subscription fee to customers that require enhanced CRM capabilities. We have a growing portfolio of cloud applications that serve different customer segments and markets. We have acquired several companies in complementary businesses, entered joint ventures and added services and technologies in an effort to strengthen and extend our Sales Cloud and Service Cloud application offerings. We expect to continue to make such investments and acquisitions in the future. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    Leading the industry transformation to the social enterprise . We believe that the market transformation to cloud applications and platforms continues to be a growing trend in the information technology industry and that the next generation of enterprise computing is what we call the social enterprise. We believe the world is experiencing a social revolution. The number of social networking users has surpassed e-mail users, and people access the Internet more from mobile devices than from desktops. A core component of our business strategy is to enable companies to transform themselves into social enterprises through the use of our services. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    Pursuing new customers and new territories aggressively. We believe that our social enterprise solution, cloud applications and cloud platforms provide significant value for businesses of any size. As a result, we will continue to aggressively target businesses of all sizes, primarily through our direct sales force. We have steadily increased and plan to continue to increase the number of direct sales professionals we employ, and we intend to develop additional distribution channels for our service. We have created several editions of our service to address the distinct requirements of businesses of different sizes. We also believe that there is a substantial market opportunity for our service outside of North America. We plan to continue to aggressively market to customers outside of North America by recruiting local sales and support professionals and by building partnerships that help us add customers in these regions. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    Deepening relationships with our existing customer base. We believe there is significant opportunity to deepen our relationships with existing customers. As our customers realize the benefits of our service, we aim to either upgrade the customer to higher priced editions or sell more subscriptions by targeting ##TABLE_END  ##TABLE_START  additional functional areas and business units within the customer organization, and ultimately pursue enterprise-wide deployments. Our goal is to have our customers renew their subscriptions at the end of their contractual terms and we run customer success and other programs in an effort to secure renewals of existing customers. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    Encouraging the development of third-party applications on our cloud computing platforms . Our Force.com and Heroku cloud computing platform enables existing customers, ISVs and third-party developers to develop and deliver cloud applications they have built in our multi-tenant environment. It is a platform on which applications can be created, tested, published, and run. In addition, these applications can be listed on the AppExchange, our online marketplace of cloud applications, or sold by ISVs. We believe the ecosystem of cloud developers and ISVs will address the business requirements of both current and potential customers. ##TABLE_END Technology, Development and Operations We deliver our service as a highly scalable, multi-tenant application. We use commercially available hardware and a combination of proprietary and commercially available software to provide our service. We have optimized our services to run on specific databases and operating systems using the tools and platforms best suited to serve our customers rather than providing software that must be written to different hardware, operating system and database platforms, or that depends upon a customers unique systems environment. Performance, functional depth and the usability of our service drive our technology decisions and product direction. Our service treats all customers as logically separate tenants in central applications, databases and other resources. As a result, we are able to spread the cost of delivering our service across our user base. In addition, because we do not have to manage thousands of distinct applications with their own business logic and database schemas, we believe that we can scale our business faster than traditional software vendors. Moreover, we can focus our resources on building new functionality to deliver to our customer base as a whole rather than on maintaining an infrastructure to support each of their distinct applications. Because of our multi-tenant and logically separated architecture, we are able to provide all of our customers with a service based on a single version of our applications. We are able to upgrade all of our customers at the same time with each release. As a result, we do not have to maintain multiple versions of our applications. Our research and development efforts are focused on improving and enhancing the features, functionality and security of our existing service offerings as well as developing new services. In addition, from time to time we supplement our internal research and development activities with outside development resources and acquired technology. Our customers access our service over the Internet through supported Internet browsers and mobile devices. We currently serve our customers from third-party data center hosting facilities located in the United States and other countries. Customers We sell to businesses of all sizes. The number of paying subscriptions at each of our customers ranges from one to hundreds of thousands. None of our customers accounted for more than five percent of our revenues in fiscal 2012, 2011, or 2010. Sources of Revenue We derive our revenues primarily from subscription fees from our customers and support revenues from customers purchasing additional support beyond the standard support that is included in the basic subscription fee.   We generally recognize revenue ratably over the contract term, beginning on the commencement date of each contract. Amounts that have been invoiced are recorded in accounts receivable and in deferred revenue or revenue, depending on whether the revenue recognition criteria have been met. Sales, Marketing and Customer Support We organize our sales and marketing programs by geographic regions, including the Americas, Europe, and Asia Pacific which includes Japan. Over 30 percent of our revenue comes from customers outside of the Americas. Direct Sales We sell subscriptions to our service primarily through our direct sales force comprised of inside sales, which consists of personnel that sell to customers primarily by phone, and field sales personnel, that are primarily based in geographic territories comprising customers and prospects. Both our inside sales and field sales personnel are supported by telesales representatives who are primarily responsible for generating qualifying leads. Our small business, general business and enterprise account executives and account managers focus their efforts on small, medium-size and large enterprises, respectively. Referral and Indirect Sales We have a network of partners who refer customer prospects to us and assist us in selling to these prospects. The network includes consulting firms, other technology vendors, systems integrators and partners in markets where we do not have a large direct sales presence. In return, we typically pay these partners a fee based on the first-year subscription revenue generated by the customers they refer. We expense these fees at the time the customer signs the subscription service contract. We also continue to develop distribution channels for our subscription service. Marketing Our marketing strategy is to promote our brand and generate significant demand for our offerings. We use a variety of marketing programs to target our prospective and current customers, partners, and developers. Our primary marketing activities include: ##TABLE_START    press and industry analyst relations to garner third-party validation and generate positive coverage for our company and product strategy; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    user conferences and launch events, as well as participation in trade shows and industry events, to create customer awareness and prospect enthusiasm; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    use of social network solutions such as Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn and YouTube; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    search engine marketing and advertising to drive traffic to our Web properties; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    Web site development to engage and educate prospects and generate interest through product information and demonstrations, free trials, case studies, white papers, and marketing collateral; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    email, direct mail, and phone campaigns to capture leads that can be funneled into our sales organization; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    use of customer testimonials; and ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    sales tools and field marketing events to enable our sales organization to more effectively convert pipeline into completed transactions. ##TABLE_END  Customer Service and Support Our global customer support group responds to both business and technical inquires from our customers relating to how to use our products and is available to customers by the web, telephone and email. Basic customer support during business hours is available at no charge to customers who purchase any of our paying editions. Premier customer support includes extended availability and additional services, such as an assigned support representative and/or administrator. Premier customer support is available for a separate fee, or is included in our Unlimited Edition. Additional support services include developer support and partner support. Seasonality Our fourth quarter has historically been our strongest quarter for new business. For a more detailed discussion, see the Seasonal Nature of Deferred Revenue and Accounts Receivable discussion in Managements Discussion and Analysis. Competition The market for our offerings is highly competitive, rapidly evolving and fragmented, and subject to changing technology, frequent introductions of new products and services, and as we have seen recently, consolidation. Many prospective customers have invested substantial personnel and financial resources to implement and integrate traditional enterprise software into their businesses, and therefore may be reluctant or unwilling to migrate to an enterprise cloud computing application service. Additionally, third party developers may be reluctant to build application services on our platform since they have invested in other competing technology platforms. We compete primarily with vendors of packaged business software and companies offering cloud computing CRM applications. We also compete with internally developed applications and face, or expect to face, competition from enterprise software vendors and online service providers who may develop toolsets and products that allow customers to build new applications that run on the customers current infrastructure or as hosted services. Our current principal competitors include: ##TABLE_START    enterprise software application vendors; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    cloud computing CRM application service providers; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    traditional platform development environment companies; and ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    cloud computing development platform companies. ##TABLE_END We believe that as enterprise software application and platform vendors shift more of their focus to cloud computing, they will be a greater competitive threat. Intellectual Property We rely on a combination of trademark, copyright, trade secret and patent laws in the United States and other jurisdictions as well as confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions to protect our proprietary technology and our brand. We also enter into confidentiality and proprietary rights agreements with our employees, consultants and other third parties and control access to software, documentation and other proprietary information. Employees As of January 31, 2012, we had 7,785 employees. None of our employees are represented by a labor union.

RISK FACTORS ##TABLE_END The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones facing us. Other events that we do not currently anticipate or that we currently deem immaterial also may affect our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. Risks Related to Our Business and Industry Defects or disruptions in our service could diminish demand for our service and subject us to substantial liability. Because our service is complex and incorporates a variety of hardware and proprietary and third-party software, our service may have errors or defects that could result in unanticipated downtime for our subscribers and harm to our reputation and our business. Internet-based services frequently contain undetected errors when first introduced or when new versions or enhancements are released. We have from time to time found defects in our service and new errors in our service may be detected in the future. In addition, our customers may use our service in unanticipated ways that may cause a disruption in service for other customers attempting to access their data. As we acquire companies, we may encounter difficulty in incorporating the acquired technologies into our service and maintaining the quality standards that are consistent with our brand and reputation. Since our customers use our service for important aspects of their business, any errors, defects, disruptions in service or other performance problems could hurt our reputation and may damage our customers businesses. As a result, customers could elect to not renew, or delay or withhold payment to us, we could lose future sales or customers may make warranty or other claims against us, which could result in an increase in our provision for doubtful accounts, an increase in collection cycles for accounts receivable or the expense and risk of litigation. Interruptions or delays in service from our third-party data center hosting facilities could impair the delivery of our service and harm our business. We currently serve our customers from third-party data center hosting facilities located in the United States and other countries. Any damage to, or failure of, our systems generally could result in interruptions in our service. Interruptions in our service may reduce our revenue, cause us to issue credits or pay penalties, cause customers to terminate their subscriptions and adversely affect our renewal rates and our ability to attract new customers. Our business will also be harmed if our customers and potential customers believe our service is unreliable. As part of our current disaster recovery arrangements, our production environment and all of our customers data is currently replicated in near real-time in a facility located in the United States. Companies and products added through acquisition may be temporarily served through alternate facilities. We do not control the operation of any of these facilities, and they are vulnerable to damage or interruption from earthquakes, floods, fires, power loss, telecommunications failures and similar events. They may also be subject to break-ins, sabotage, intentional acts of vandalism and similar misconduct. Despite precautions taken at these facilities, the occurrence of a natural disaster or an act of terrorism, a decision to close the facilities without adequate notice or other unanticipated problems at these facilities could result in lengthy interruptions in our service. Even with the disaster recovery arrangements, our service could be interrupted. As we continue to add data centers and add capacity in our existing data centers, we may move or transfer our data and our customers data. Despite precautions taken during this process, any unsuccessful data transfers may impair the delivery of our service. If our security measures are breached and unauthorized access is obtained to a customers data or our data or our IT systems, our service may be perceived as not being secure, customers may curtail or stop using our service and we may incur significant legal and financial exposure and liabilities. Our service involves the storage and transmission of customers proprietary information, and security breaches could expose us to a risk of loss of this information, litigation and possible liability. These security  measures may be breached as a result of third-party action, including intentional misconduct by computer hackers, employee error, malfeasance or otherwise and result in someone obtaining unauthorized access to our customers data or our data, including our intellectual property and other confidential business information, or our IT systems. Additionally, third parties may attempt to fraudulently induce employees or customers into disclosing sensitive information such as user names, passwords or other information in order to gain access to our customers data or our data or IT systems. Because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access, or to sabotage systems, change frequently and generally are not recognized until launched against a target, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures. In addition, our customers may authorize third-party technology providers on our AppExchange directory to access their customer data. Because we do not control the transmissions between our customers and third-party AppExchange technology providers, or the processing of such data by third-party AppExchange technology providers, we cannot ensure the integrity or security of such transmissions or processing. Any security breach could result in a loss of confidence in the security of our service, damage our reputation, negatively impact our future sales, disrupt our business and lead to legal liability. Because we recognize revenue from subscriptions for our service over the term of the subscription, downturns or upturns in new business may not be immediately reflected in our operating results. We generally recognize revenue from customers ratably over the terms of their subscription agreements, which are typically 12 to 24 months. As a result, most of the revenue we report in each quarter is the result of subscription agreements entered into during previous quarters. Consequently, a decline in new or renewed subscriptions in any one quarter may not be reflected in our revenue results for that quarter. Any such decline, however, will negatively affect our revenue in future quarters. Accordingly, the effect of significant downturns in sales and market acceptance of our service, and potential changes in our rate of renewals may not be fully reflected in our results of operations until future periods. Our subscription model also makes it difficult for us to rapidly increase our revenue through additional sales in any period, as revenue from new customers must be recognized over the applicable subscription term. Our efforts to expand our service beyond the CRM market and to develop our existing service in order to keep pace with technological developments may not succeed and may reduce our revenue growth rate and/or harm our business. We derive substantially all of our revenue from subscriptions to our CRM enterprise cloud computing application service, and we expect this will continue for the foreseeable future. The market for our Force.com cloud computing platform remains relatively new and it is uncertain whether our efforts will ever result in significant revenue for us. Further, the introduction of new services beyond the CRM market may not be successful, and early stage interest and adoption of such new services may not result in long term success or significant revenue for us. Our efforts to expand our service beyond the CRM market may not succeed and may reduce our revenue growth rate. Additionally, if we are unable to develop enhancements to and new features for our existing service or new services that keep pace with rapid technological developments, our business will be harmed. The success of enhancements, new features and services depends on several factors, including the timely completion, introduction and market acceptance of the feature or edition. Failure in this regard may significantly impair our revenue growth. In addition, because our service is designed to operate on a variety of network hardware and software platforms using a standard browser, we will need to continuously modify and enhance our service to keep pace with changes in Internet-related hardware, software, communication, browser and database technologies. We may not be successful in either developing these modifications and enhancements or in bringing them to market timely. Furthermore, uncertainties about the timing and nature of new network platforms or technologies, or modifications to existing platforms or technologies, could increase our research and development or service delivery expenses. Any failure of our service to operate effectively with future network platforms and technologies could reduce the demand for our service, result in customer dissatisfaction and harm our business.  If we experience significant fluctuations in our rate of anticipated growth and fail to balance our expenses with our revenue forecasts, our results could be harmed. Due to our evolving business model and the unpredictability of future general economic and financial market conditions, we may not be able to accurately forecast our rate of growth. We plan our expense levels and investment on estimates of future revenue and future anticipated rate of growth. We may not be able to adjust our spending quickly enough if the addition of new subscriptions or the renewal rate for existing subscriptions falls short of our expectations. A portion of our expenses may also be a fixed cost in nature for some minimum amount of time, such as with a datacenter contract or office lease, so it may not be possible to reduce costs in a timely manner or without the payment of fees to exit certain obligations early. As a result, we expect that our revenues, operating results and cash flows may fluctuate significantly on a quarterly basis. Our recent revenue growth rates may not be sustainable and may decline in the future. We believe that period-to-period comparisons of our revenues, operating results and cash flows may not be meaningful and should not be relied upon as an indication of future performance. We cannot accurately predict subscription renewal or upgrade rates and the impact these rates may have on our future revenue and operating results. Our customers have no obligation to renew their subscriptions for our service after the expiration of their initial subscription period, which is typically 12 to 24 months, and in fact, some customers have elected not to renew. In addition, our customers may renew for fewer subscriptions, renew for shorter contract lengths, or renew for lower cost editions of our service. We cannot accurately predict renewal rates given our varied customer base of enterprise and small and medium size business customers and the number of multiyear subscription contracts. Our renewal rates may decline or fluctuate as a result of a number of factors, including customer dissatisfaction with our service, customers spending levels, decreases in the number of users at our customers, pricing changes and deteriorating general economic conditions. If our customers do not renew their subscriptions for our service or reduce the number of paying subscriptions at the time of renewal, our revenue will decline and our business will suffer. Our future success also depends in part on our ability to sell additional features and services, more subscriptions or enhanced editions of our service to our current customers. This may also require increasingly sophisticated and costly sales efforts that are targeted at senior management. Similarly, the rate at which our customers purchase new or enhanced services depends on a number of factors, including general economic conditions and that our customers do not react negatively to any price changes related to these additional features and services. If our efforts to upsell to our customers are not successful and negative reaction occurs, our business may suffer. We rely on third-party computer hardware and software that may be difficult to replace or which could cause errors or failures of our service. We rely on computer hardware purchased or leased and software licensed from third parties in order to offer our service, including database software from Oracle Corporation. This hardware and software may not continue to be available at reasonable prices or on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. Any loss of the right to use any of this hardware or software could significantly increase our expenses and otherwise result in delays in the provisioning of our service until equivalent technology is either developed by us, or, if available, is identified, obtained through purchase or license and integrated. Any errors or defects in third-party hardware or software could result in errors or a failure of our service which could harm our business. Weakened global economic conditions may adversely affect our industry, business and results of operations. Our overall performance depends in part on worldwide economic conditions. The United States and other key international economies have experienced in the past a downturn in which economic activity was impacted  by falling demand for a variety of goods and services, restricted credit, poor liquidity, reduced corporate profitability, volatility in credit, equity and foreign exchange markets, bankruptcies and overall uncertainty with respect to the economy. The European Union continues to face great economic uncertainty which could impact the overall world economy or various other regional economies. These conditions affect the rate of information technology spending and could adversely affect our customers ability or willingness to purchase our enterprise cloud computing services, delay prospective customers purchasing decisions, reduce the value or duration of their subscription contracts, or affect renewal rates, all of which could adversely affect our operating results. Our quarterly results can fluctuate and our stock price and the value of your investment could decline substantially. Our quarterly operating results are likely to fluctuate. For example, our fiscal fourth quarter has historically been our strongest quarter for new business and renewals. The year-over-year compounding effect of this seasonality in billing patterns and overall new business and renewal activity causes the value of invoices that we generate in the fourth quarter to continually increase in proportion to our billings in the other three quarters of our fiscal year. Additionally, some of the important factors that may cause our revenues, operating results and cash flows to fluctuate from quarter to quarter include: ##TABLE_START    our ability to retain and increase sales to existing customers, attract new customers and satisfy our customers requirements; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    the renewal rates for our service; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    the amount and timing of operating costs and capital expenditures related to the operations and expansion of our business; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    changes in deferred revenue balances and unbilled revenue balances, which are not reflected in the balance sheet, due to seasonality, the compounding effects of renewals, invoice duration, invoice timing and new business linearity; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    the number of new employees; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    changes in our pricing policies and terms of contracts, whether initiated by us or as a result of competition; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    the cost, timing and management effort for the introduction of new features to our service; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    the rate of expansion and productivity of our sales force; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    the length of the sales cycle for our service; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    new product and service introductions by our competitors; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    our success in selling our service to large enterprises; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    variations in the revenue mix of editions of our service; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    technical difficulties or interruptions in our service; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    expenses related to our real estate, our office leases and our data center capacity and expansion; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    changes in foreign currency exchange rates; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    changes in interest rates and our mix of investments, which would impact our return on our investments in cash and marketable securities; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    conditions, particularly sudden changes, in the financial markets have and may continue to impact the value of and access to our investment portfolio; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    changes in the effective tax rates due to changes in the mix of earnings and losses in countries with differing statutory tax rates, certain non-deductible expenses as a result of acquisitions, compensation, the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities and changes in federal, state or international tax laws and accounting principles; ##TABLE_END  ##TABLE_START    general economic conditions that may adversely affect either our customers ability or willingness to purchase additional subscriptions or upgrade their service, or delay a prospective customers purchasing decision, or reduce the value of new subscription contracts, or affect renewal rates; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    timing of additional investments in our enterprise cloud computing application and platform services and in our consulting service; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    regulatory compliance costs; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    the timing of customer payments and payment defaults by customers; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    costs associated with acquisitions and subsequent integration of companies and technologies; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    extraordinary expenses such as litigation or other dispute-related settlement payments; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    any adverse resolution to income tax audits in any tax jurisdictions throughout the world; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    the impact of new accounting pronouncements; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    equity issuances, including as consideration in acquisitions or due to the conversion of our outstanding convertible notes at the election of the note holders; and ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    the timing of stock awards to employees and the related adverse financial statement impact of having to expense those stock awards ratably over their vesting schedules. ##TABLE_END Many of these factors are outside of our control, and the occurrence of one or more of them might cause our operating results to vary widely. As such, we believe that quarter-to-quarter comparisons of our revenues, operating results and cash flows may not be meaningful and should not be relied upon as an indication of future performance. Additionally, we may fail to meet or exceed the expectations of securities analysts and investors, and the market price of our common stock could decline. If one or more of the securities analysts who cover us adversely change their recommendation regarding our stock, the market price of our common stock could decline. Moreover, our stock price may be based on expectations, estimates or forecasts of our future performance that may be unrealistic or that may not be met. Further, our stock price may fluctuate based on reporting by the financial media, including television, radio and press reports and blogs. The market in which we participate is intensely competitive, and if we do not compete effectively, our operating results could be harmed. The market for enterprise cloud computing applications and platform services is highly competitive, rapidly evolving and fragmented, and subject to changing technology, shifting customer needs and frequent introductions of new products and services. We compete primarily with vendors of packaged CRM software and companies offering on-demand CRM applications. We also compete with internally developed applications and face, or expect to face, competition from enterprise software vendors and online service providers who may develop toolsets and products that allow customers to build new applications that run on the customers current infrastructure or as hosted services. Our current competitors include: ##TABLE_START    enterprise software application vendors; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    on-demand CRM application service providers; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    traditional platform development environment companies; and ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    cloud computing development platform companies. ##TABLE_END Many of our current and potential competitors enjoy substantial competitive advantages, such as greater name recognition, longer operating histories and larger marketing budgets, as well as substantially greater financial, technical and other resources. In addition, many of our current and potential competitors have  established marketing relationships and access to larger customer bases, and have major distribution agreements with consultants, system integrators and resellers. As a result, our competitors may be able to respond more quickly and effectively than we can to new or changing opportunities, technologies, standards or customer requirements. Furthermore, because of these advantages, even if our service is more effective than the products that our competitors offer, potential customers might accept competitive products and services in lieu of purchasing our service. For all of these reasons, we may not be able to compete successfully against our current and future competitors. As we acquire companies or technologies, they could prove difficult to integrate, disrupt our business, dilute stockholder value and adversely affect our operating results and the value of your investment. As part of our business strategy, we periodically make investments in, or acquisitions of, complementary businesses, joint ventures, services and technologies and intellectual property rights, and we expect that we will continue to make such investments and acquisitions in the future. Acquisitions and investments involve numerous risks, including: ##TABLE_START    the potential failure to achieve the expected benefits of the combination or acquisition; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    difficulties in and the cost of integrating operations, technologies, services and personnel; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    diversion of financial and managerial resources from existing operations; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    risk of entering new markets in which we have little or no experience or where competitors may have stronger market positions; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    potential write-offs of acquired assets or investments, and potential financial and credit risks associated with acquired customers; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    potential loss of key employees; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    inability to generate sufficient revenue to offset acquisition or investment costs; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    the inability to maintain relationships with customers and partners of the acquired business; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    the difficulty of incorporating acquired technology and rights into our products and services and of maintaining the security standards consistent with our other services; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    potential unknown liabilities associated with the acquired businesses; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    unanticipated expenses related to acquired technology and its integration into existing technology; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    negative impact to our results of operations because of the depreciation and amortization of amounts related to acquired intangible assets, fixed assets and deferred compensation, and the loss of acquired deferred revenue; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    delays in customer purchases due to uncertainty related to any acquisition; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    the need to implement controls, procedures and policies appropriate for a public company at private companies that we acquire; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    challenges caused by distance, language and cultural differences; and ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    the tax effects of any such acquisitions. ##TABLE_END In addition, if we finance acquisitions by issuing equity or convertible or other debt securities, our existing stockholders may be diluted or we could face constraints related to the terms of and repayment obligation related to the incurrence of indebtedness which could affect the market price of our common stock. Further, if we fail to properly evaluate and execute acquisitions or investments, our business and prospects may be seriously harmed and the value of your investment may decline.  If the market for our technology delivery model and enterprise cloud computing services develops more slowly than we expect, our business could be harmed. Our success also depends on the willingness of third-party developers to build applications that are complementary to our service. Without the development of these applications, both current and potential customers may not find our service sufficiently attractive. In addition, for those customers who authorize a third-party technology partner access to their data, we do not provide any warranty related to the functionality, security and integrity of the data transmission or processing. Despite contract provisions to protect us, customers may look to us to support and provide warranties for the third-party applications, which may expose us to potential claims, liabilities and obligations for applications we did not develop or sell. Supporting our existing and growing customer base could strain our personnel resources and infrastructure, and if we are unable to scale our operations and increase productivity, we may not be able to successfully implement our business plan. We continue to experience significant growth in our customer base, which has placed a strain on our management, administrative, operational and financial infrastructure. We anticipate that additional investments in our infrastructure, research and development, and real estate spending will be required to scale our operations and increase productivity, to address the needs of our customers, to further develop and enhance our service, to expand into new geographic areas, and to scale with the overall growth of our Company. Our success will depend in part upon the ability of our senior management to manage our projected growth effectively. To do so, we must continue to increase the productivity of our existing employees and to hire, train and manage new employees as needed. To manage the expected domestic and international growth of our operations and personnel, we will need to continue to improve our operational, financial and management controls, our reporting systems and procedures, and our utilization of real estate. The additional investments we are making will increase our cost base, which will make it more difficult for us to offset any future revenue shortfalls by reducing expenses in the short term. If we fail to successfully scale our operations and increase productivity, we will be unable to execute our business plan. As more of our sales efforts are targeted at larger enterprise customers, our sales cycle may become more time-consuming and expensive, we may encounter pricing pressure and implementation and customization challenges, and we may have to delay revenue recognition for some complex transactions, all of which could harm our business and operating results. As we target more of our sales efforts at larger enterprise customers, we will face greater costs, longer sales cycles and less predictability in completing some of our sales. In this market segment, the customers decision to use our service may be an enterprise-wide decision and, if so, these types of sales would require us to provide greater levels of education regarding the use and benefits of our service, as well as education regarding privacy and data protection laws and regulations to prospective customers with international operations. In addition, larger customers may demand more customization, integration services and features. As a result of these factors, these sales opportunities may require us to devote greater sales support and professional services resources to individual customers, driving up costs and time required to complete sales and diverting our own sales and professional services resources to a smaller number of larger transactions, while potentially requiring us to delay revenue recognition on some of these transactions until the technical or implementation requirements have been met. Professional services may also be performed by a third party or a combination of our own staff and a third party. Our strategy is to work with third parties to increase the breadth of capability and depth of capacity for delivery of these services to our customers. If a customer is not satisfied with the quality of work performed by us or a third party or with the type of services or solutions delivered, then we could incur additional costs to address the situation, the profitability of that work might be impaired, and the customers dissatisfaction with our  services could damage our ability to obtain additional work from that customer. In addition, negative publicity related to our customer relationships, regardless of its accuracy, may further damage our business by affecting our ability to compete for new business with current and prospective customers. Periodic changes to our sales organization can be disruptive and may reduce our rate of growth. We periodically change and make adjustments to our sales organization in response to market opportunities, competitive threats, management changes, product introductions or enhancements, acquisitions, sales performance, increases in sales headcount, cost levels and other internal and external considerations. In the past, these changes sometimes resulted in a temporary lack of focus and reduced productivity; these effects could recur in connection with any future sales changes we might undertake and our rate of revenue growth could be negatively affected. In addition, any significant change to the way we structure our compensation of our sales organization may be disruptive and may affect our revenue growth. Sales to customers outside the United States expose us to risks inherent in international sales. We sell our service throughout the world and are subject to risks and challenges associated with international business. For example, sales in Europe and Asia Pacific together represented approximately 32 percent of our total revenues for the year ended January 31, 2012, and we intend to continue to expand our international sales efforts. The risks and challenges associated with sales to customers outside the United States include: ##TABLE_START    localization of our service, including translation into foreign languages and associated expenses; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    laws and business practices favoring local competitors; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    compliance with multiple, conflicting and changing governmental laws and regulations, including employment, tax, privacy and data protection laws and regulations; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    pressure on the creditworthiness of sovereign nations, particularly in Europe, where we have customers and a small balance of our cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities. Liquidity issues or political actions by sovereign nations could result in decreased values for our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities balances; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    regional data privacy laws that apply to the transmission of our customers data across international borders; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    treatment of revenue from international sources and changes to tax codes, including being subject to foreign tax laws and being liable for paying withholding income or other taxes in foreign jurisdictions; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    foreign currency fluctuations and controls; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    different pricing environments; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    different or lesser protection of our intellectual property; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    longer accounts receivable payment cycles and other collection difficulties; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    natural disasters, acts of war, terrorism, pandemics or security breaches; and ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    regional economic and political conditions. ##TABLE_END Any of these factors could negatively impact our business and results of operations. Additionally, our international subscription fees are paid either in U.S. dollars or local currency. As a result, fluctuations in the value of the U.S. dollar and foreign currencies may make our service more expensive for international customers, which could harm our business.  We have been and may in the future be sued by third parties for various claims including alleged infringement of proprietary rights. We are involved in various legal matters arising from the normal course of business activities. These may include claims, suits, government investigations and other proceedings involving alleged infringement of third-party patents and other intellectual property rights, and commercial, labor and employment, wage and hour, and other matters. The software and Internet industries are characterized by the existence of a large number of patents, trademarks and copyrights and by frequent litigation based on allegations of infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights. We have received in the past and may receive in the future communications from third parties claiming that we have infringed the intellectual property rights of others. In addition we have been, and may in the future be, sued by third parties for alleged infringement of their claimed proprietary rights. Our technologies may be subject to injunction if they are found to infringe the rights of a third party or we may be required to pay damages, or both. Many of our subscription agreements require us to indemnify our customers for third-party intellectual property infringement claims, which would increase the cost to us of an adverse ruling on such a claim. The outcome of any litigation, regardless of its merits, is inherently uncertain. Any claims and lawsuits, and the disposition of such claims and lawsuits, could be time-consuming and expensive to resolve, divert management attention from executing our business plan, lead to attempts on the part of other parties to pursue similar claims and, in the case of intellectual property claims, require us to change our technology, change our business practices and/or pay monetary damages or enter into short- or long-term royalty or licensing agreements. Any adverse determination related to intellectual property claims or other litigation could prevent us from offering our service to others, could be material to our financial condition or cash flows, or both, or could otherwise adversely affect our operating results. In addition, depending on the nature and timing of any such dispute, a resolution of a legal matter could materially affect our future results of operation or cash flows or both. In addition, our exposure to risks associated with various claims, including the use of intellectual property, may be increased as a result of acquisitions of other companies. For example, we may have a lower level of visibility into the development process with respect to intellectual property or the care taken to safeguard against infringement risks with respect to the acquired company or technology. In addition, third parties may make infringement and similar or related claims after we have acquired technology that had not been asserted prior to our acquisition. Any failure to protect our intellectual property rights could impair our ability to protect our proprietary technology and our brand. If we fail to protect our intellectual property rights adequately, our competitors may gain access to our technology, and our business may be harmed. In addition, defending our intellectual property rights may entail significant expense. Any of our patents, trademarks or other intellectual property rights may be challenged by others or invalidated through administrative process or litigation. While we have some U.S. patents and many U.S. and international patent applications pending, we may be unable to obtain patent protection for the technology covered in our patent applications. In addition, our existing patents and any patents issued in the future may not provide us with competitive advantages, or may be successfully challenged by third parties. Furthermore, legal standards relating to the validity, enforceability and scope of protection of intellectual property rights are uncertain. Effective patent, trademark, copyright and trade secret protection may not be available to us in every country in which our service is available. The laws of some foreign countries may not be as protective of intellectual property rights as those in the U.S., and mechanisms for enforcement of intellectual property rights may be inadequate. Accordingly, despite our efforts, we may be unable to prevent third parties from infringing upon or misappropriating our intellectual property.  We may be required to spend significant resources to monitor and protect our intellectual property rights. We may initiate claims or litigation against third parties for infringement of our proprietary rights or to establish the validity of our proprietary rights. Any litigation, whether or not it is resolved in our favor, could result in significant expense to us and divert the efforts of our technical and management personnel. Privacy concerns and laws, evolving regulation of the Internet, cross-border data transfers and other domestic or foreign regulations may limit the use and adoption of our solution and adversely affect our business. As Internet commerce continues to evolve, increasing regulation by federal, state or foreign governments and agencies becomes more likely. For example, we believe increased regulation is occurring in the area of data privacy, and laws and regulations applying to the solicitation, collection, processing or use of personal or consumer information could affect our customers ability to use and share data, potentially reducing demand for our solutions and restricting our ability to store, process and share data with our customers. Our customers can use our service to store contact and other personal or identifying information regarding their customers and contacts. Federal, state and foreign governments and agencies have adopted or are considering adopting laws and regulations regarding the collection, use and disclosure of personal information obtained from consumers and individuals in addition to laws and regulations that impact the cross-border transfer of personal information. The costs of compliance with, and other burdens imposed by, such laws and regulations that are applicable to the businesses of our customers may limit the use and adoption of our service and reduce overall demand for it, or lead to significant fines, penalties or liabilities for any noncompliance with such privacy laws. Furthermore, privacy concerns may cause our customers customers to resist providing the personal data necessary to allow our customers to use our service effectively. Even the perception of privacy concerns, whether or not valid, may inhibit market adoption of our service in certain industries. In addition to government activity, privacy advocacy groups and the technology and other industries are considering various new, additional or different self-regulatory standards that may place additional burdens on us. If the gathering of personal information were to be curtailed in this manner, CRM solutions would be less effective, which may reduce demand for our service and harm our business. If we fail to develop and maintain our brands, our business may suffer. We believe that developing and maintaining awareness of the salesforce.com brand and our other brands is critical to achieving widespread acceptance of our existing and future services and is an important element in attracting new customers. We have incurred and expect to continue to incur significant expense to build our brands. Brand promotion activities may not yield increased revenue, and even if they do, any increased revenue may not offset the expenses we incurred in building our brands. If we fail to successfully promote and maintain our brands, or incur substantial expenses in an unsuccessful attempt to promote and maintain our brands, we may fail to attract enough new customers or retain our existing customers to the extent necessary to realize a sufficient return on our brand-building efforts, and our business could suffer. We may lose key members of our management team or development and operations personnel, and may be unable to attract and retain employees we need to support our operations and growth. Our success depends substantially upon the continued services of our executive officers and other key members of management, particularly our Chief Executive Officer. From time to time, there may be changes in our executive management team resulting from the hiring or departure of executives. Such changes in our executive management team may be disruptive to our business. We are also substantially dependent on the continued service of our existing development and operations personnel because of the complexity of our service and technologies. We do not have employment agreements with any of our executive officers, key management, development or operations personnel and they could terminate their employment with us at any time. The loss of one or more of our key employees or groups could seriously harm our business.  In the technology industry, there is substantial and continuous competition for engineers with high levels of experience in designing, developing and managing software and Internet-related services, as well as competition for sales executives and operations personnel. We may not be successful in attracting and retaining qualified personnel. We have from time to time experienced, and we expect to continue to experience, difficulty in hiring and retaining highly skilled employees with appropriate qualifications. If we fail to attract new personnel or fail to retain and motivate our current personnel, our business and future growth prospects could be severely harmed. We may not realize any benefits in connection with our purchase of undeveloped land in San Francisco. If we do not realize any benefits, our financial performance may be negatively impacted. In November 2010, we purchased approximately 14 acres of undeveloped real estate in San Francisco, California, including entitlements and improvements associated with the land. We may not realize any benefits with respect to the purchase of such real estate. We have devoted significant capital resources to the purchase, and if we develop the real estate will be required to devote substantial additional resources in the future, which may impact our liquidity and financial flexibility. Finally, real estate assets are not as liquid as certain other types of assets. In the event that we cease development of the real estate in the future or have a future need to sell this property, we may not be able to do so on favorable terms, or at all, and our financial results may be negatively impacted. Natural disasters and other events beyond our control could materially adversely affect us. Natural disasters or other catastrophic events may cause damage or disruption to our operations, international commerce and the global economy, and thus could have a strong negative effect on us. Our business operations are subject to interruption by natural disasters, fire, power shortages, pandemics and other events beyond our control. Although we maintain crisis management and disaster response plans, such events could make it difficult or impossible for us to deliver our services to our customers, and could decrease demand for our services. The majority of our research and development activities, corporate headquarters, information technology systems, and other critical business operations, are located near major seismic faults in the San Francisco Bay Area. Because we do not carry earthquake insurance for direct quake-related losses, and significant recovery time could be required to resume operations, our financial condition and operating results could be materially adversely affected in the event of a major earthquake or catastrophic event. Risks Relating to Capitalization Matters The market price of our common stock is likely to be volatile and could subject us to litigation. The trading prices of the securities of technology companies have been highly volatile. Accordingly, the market price of our common stock has been and is likely to continue to be subject to wide fluctuations. Factors affecting the market price of our common stock include: ##TABLE_START    variations in our operating results, earnings per share, cash flows from operating activities, deferred revenue and other financial metrics and non-financial metrics, and how those results compare to analyst expectations; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    forward looking guidance to industry and financial analysts related to future revenue and earnings per share; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    the net increases in the number of customers, either independently or as compared with published expectations of industry, financial or other analysts that cover our company; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    changes in the estimates of our operating results or changes in recommendations by securities analysts that elect to follow our common stock; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    announcements of technological innovations, new services or service enhancements, strategic alliances or significant agreements by us or by our competitors; ##TABLE_END  ##TABLE_START    announcements by us or by our competitors of mergers or other strategic acquisitions, or rumors of such transactions involving us or our competitors; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    announcements of customer additions and customer cancellations or delays in customer purchases; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    recruitment or departure of key personnel; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    disruptions in our service due to computer hardware, software, network or data center problems; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    the economy as a whole, market conditions in our industry and the industries of our customers; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    trading activity by a limited number of stockholders who together beneficially own a majority of our outstanding common stock; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    the issuance of shares of common stock by us, whether in connection with an acquisition, a capital raising transaction or upon conversion of some or all of our outstanding convertible senior notes; and ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    any other factors discussed herein. ##TABLE_END In addition, if the market for technology stocks or the stock market in general experiences uneven investor confidence, the market price of our common stock could decline for reasons unrelated to our business, operating results or financial condition. The market price of our common stock might also decline in reaction to events that affect other companies within, or outside, our industry even if these events do not directly affect us. Some companies that have experienced volatility in the trading price of their stock have been the subject of securities class action litigation. If we are the subject of such litigation, it could result in substantial costs and a diversion of managements attention and resources. Provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws, Delaware law and our outstanding convertible notes might discourage, delay or prevent a change of control of our company or changes in our management and, therefore, depress the market price of our common stock. Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that could depress the market price of our common stock by acting to discourage, delay or prevent a change in control of our company or changes in our management that the stockholders of our company may deem advantageous. These provisions among other things: ##TABLE_START    establish a classified board of directors so that not all members of our board are elected at one time; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    permit the board of directors to establish the number of directors; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    provide that directors may only be removed for cause and only with the approval of 66 2/3 percent of our stockholders; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    require super-majority voting to amend some provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    authorize the issuance of blank check preferred stock that our board could use to implement a stockholder rights plan (also known as a poison pill); ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    eliminate the ability of our stockholders to call special meetings of stockholders; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    prohibit stockholder action by written consent, which requires all stockholder actions to be taken at a meeting of our stockholders; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    provide that the board of directors is expressly authorized to make, alter or repeal our bylaws; and ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    establish advance notice requirements for nominations for election to our board or for proposing matters that can be acted upon by stockholders at annual stockholder meetings. ##TABLE_END  In addition, Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law may discourage, delay or prevent a change in control of our company. Section 203 imposes certain restrictions on merger, business combinations and other transactions between us and holders of 15 percent or more of our common stock. In addition, the fundamental change purchase rights applicable to our convertible notes, which will allow note holders to require us to purchase all or a portion of their notes upon the occurrence of a fundamental change, and the provisions requiring an increase to the conversion rate for conversions in connection with a make-whole fundamental change may in certain circumstances delay or prevent a takeover of us and the removal of incumbent management that might otherwise be beneficial to investors. ##TABLE_START ", "1B": " ITEM 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS ##TABLE_END None. ##TABLE_START ", "2": " ITEM 2. PROPERTIES ##TABLE_END As of January 31, 2012, our executive offices and principal office for domestic marketing, sales, professional services and development occupy over 650,000 square feet in the San Francisco Bay Area under leases that expire at various times through April 2021. We also lease space in various locations throughout the United States for local sales and professional services personnel. Our foreign subsidiaries lease office space for their operations including local sales and professional services personnel. We believe that our existing facilities and offices are adequate to meet our current requirements. See Note 7, Commitments, in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information about our lease commitments. If we require additional space, we believe that we will be able to obtain such space on acceptable, commercially reasonable terms. ##TABLE_START ", "3": " ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS ##TABLE_END In the ordinary course of business, we are involved in various legal proceedings and claims related to alleged infringement of third-party patents and other intellectual property rights, commercial, employment, wage and hour, and other claims. We have been, and may in the future be, put on notice and/or sued by third parties for alleged infringement of their proprietary rights, including patent infringement. We evaluate these claims and lawsuits with respect to their potential merits, our potential defenses and counter claims, and the expected effect on us. Our technologies may be subject to injunction if they are found to infringe the rights of a third party. In addition, many of our subscription agreements require us to indemnify our customers for third-party intellectual property infringement claims, which could increase the cost to us of an adverse ruling on such a claim. The outcome of any litigation, regardless of its merits, is inherently uncertain. Any intellectual property claims and other lawsuits, and the disposition of such claims and lawsuits, could be time-consuming and expensive to resolve, divert our attention from executing our business plan, lead to attempts on the part of other parties to seek similar claims and, in the case of intellectual property claims, require us to change our technology, change our business practices and/or pay monetary damages or enter into short- or long-term royalty or licensing agreements. In general, the resolution of a legal matter could prevent us from offering our service to others, could be material to our financial condition or cash flows, or both, or could otherwise adversely affect our operating results. We make a provision for a liability relating to legal matters when it is both probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. These provisions are reviewed at least quarterly  and adjusted to reflect the impacts of negotiations, estimated settlements, legal rulings, advice of legal counsel and other information and events pertaining to a particular matter. In our opinion, resolution of all current matters is not expected to have a material adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations, cash flows or financial position. However, depending on the nature and timing of any such dispute, an unfavorable resolution of a matter could materially affect our future results of operations or cash flows, or both, of a particular quarter. ##TABLE_START ", "4": " ITEM 4.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS ##TABLE_END The following discussion contains forward-looking statements, including, without limitation, our expectations and statements regarding our outlook and future revenues, expenses, results of operations, liquidity, plans, strategies and objectives of management and any assumptions underlying any of the foregoing. Our actual results may differ significantly from those projected in the forward-looking statements. Factors that might cause future actual results to differ materially from our recent results or those projected in the forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, those discussed in the section titled of this Annual Report on Form 10-K Risk Factors. Except as required by law, we assume no obligation to update the forward-looking statements or our risk factors for any reason. Overview We are a leading provider of enterprise cloud computing and social enterprise solutions, and are dedicated to helping customers transform themselves into social enterprises. Social enterprises leverage social, mobile and open technologies to place their customers and employees at the center of their business and to engage and collaborate with them in new and powerful ways. Our technologies are targeted at businesses of all sizes and industries worldwide. We were founded in February 1999 and began offering our enterprise customer relationship management (CRM) application service in February 2000. Since then, we have augmented our CRM service with new editions, services and enhanced features. Over the last few years, we have both developed and acquired several mobile, social and open technologies to help our customers become social enterprises. We introduced our Force.com platform to customers and developers so they can build complementary applications to extend beyond CRM. We launched our AppExchange directory of enterprise cloud computing applications and services that are integrated with our flagship CRM product and in most cases have been developed on our Force.com platform by third parties. We introduced Chatter, a collaboration application for the enterprise to connect and share information securely and in real-time. Recently we enabled companies to invite their customers to collaborate with Chatter in private groups on this corporate social network. Our Salesforce Data.com (Data.com) offering, which provides some contacts from Jigsaw Data Corporation (Jigsaw), provides the most complete source of accurate business data and seamlessly integrates with our CRM products. We also expanded our platform offering via the acquisition of Heroku, Inc. (Heroku) an application development platform and the launch of Database.com, the worlds first enterprise cloud database. We acquired Radian6 Technologies, Inc. (Radian6) to help companies monitor and engage with their customers via social media. Our objective is to help companies put customers at the center of their businesses and transform themselves into social enterprises by leveraging our applications and platforms. Key elements of our strategy include: ##TABLE_START    Strengthening our existing sales and service cloud applications and extending into new functional areas within the social enterprise; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    Leading the industry transformation to the social enterprise; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    Pursuing new customers and new territories aggressively; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    Deepening relationships with our existing customer base; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    Encouraging the development of third-party applications on our cloud computing platforms. ##TABLE_END We believe the factors that will influence our ability to achieve our objectives include our prospective customers willingness to migrate to enterprise cloud computing services; the performance and security of our service; our ability to continue to release, and gain customer acceptance of, new and improved features; our ability to successfully integrate acquired businesses and technologies; successful customer adoption and utilization of our service; acceptance of our service in markets where we have few customers; the emergence of  additional competitors in our market and improved product offerings by existing and new competitors; the location of new data centers; third-party developers willingness to develop applications on our platforms; and general economic conditions which could affect our customers ability and willingness to purchase our services, delay the customers purchasing decision or affect renewal rates. To address these factors, we will need to, among other things, continue to add substantial numbers of paying subscriptions, upgrade our customers to fully featured versions such as our Unlimited Edition or arrangements such as a social enterprise license agreement, provide high quality technical support to our customers and encourage the development of third-party applications on our platforms. Our plans to invest for future growth include the continuation of the expansion of our data center capacity. We also plan to continue to hire additional personnel, particularly in direct sales, other customer-related areas and research and development. As part of our growth plans, we intend to continue to focus on retaining customers at the time of renewal. Additionally, we plan to: expand our domestic and international selling and marketing activities; continue to develop our brands; add additional distribution channels; increase our research and development activities to upgrade and extend our service offerings; develop new services and technologies and integrate acquired technologies; and add to our global infrastructure to support our growth. We also regularly evaluate acquisitions or investment opportunities in complementary businesses, joint ventures, services and technologies, and intellectual property rights in an effort to expand our service offerings. We expect to continue to make such investments and acquisitions in the future. As such, we plan to reinvest a significant portion of our incremental revenue in fiscal 2013 to grow our business and continue our leadership role in the cloud computing industry. During fiscal 2012, we acquired several businesses and technologies to strengthen and extend our service offerings. In May 2011, we acquired Radian6 for a total purchase consideration of approximately $336.6 million, net of cash acquired. Radian6 is a cloud application vendor that provides customers with social media monitoring, measurement and engagement solutions. We acquired Radian6 for its developed technology, assembled workforce, expected synergies and expanded market opportunities when integrating Radian6s social solution technology with our current product offerings. In September 2011, we acquired Assistly for a total purchase consideration of approximately $58.7 million. Assistly is a cloud-based provider of customer service solutions. We acquired Assistly for its developed help desk application technology in order to expand our customer service market opportunities in the small and emerging business market. In order to expand our mobile and social consulting services, in December 2011, we acquired Model Metrics, a cloud computing professional services company, for a total purchase consideration of approximately $66.7 million. We expect marketing and sales costs, which were 52 percent of our total revenues for fiscal 2012 and 48 percent for the same period a year ago, to continue to represent a substantial portion of total revenues in the future as we seek to add and manage more paying subscribers, and build greater brand awareness. Fiscal Year Our fiscal year ends on January 31. References to fiscal 2012, for example, refer to the fiscal year ended January 31, 2012.  Sources of Revenues We derive our revenues from: (1) subscription fees from customers accessing our enterprise cloud computing services; (2) support revenues from customers purchasing additional support beyond the standard support that is included in the basic subscription fees; (3) professional services, which include consulting services such as process mapping and project management, and implementation services including systems integration, technical architecture and development, and data conversion; and (4) other revenue, which consists primarily of training fees. Subscription and support revenues accounted for approximately 94 percent of our total revenues during fiscal 2012. Subscription revenues are driven primarily by the number of paying subscribers, varying service types, the price of our service and service renewal rates. We define a customer as a separate and distinct buying entity (e.g., a company, a distinct business unit of a large corporation, a partnership, etc.) that has entered into a contract to access our enterprise cloud computing services. We define a subscription as a unique user account purchased by a customer for use by its employees or other customer-authorized users, and we refer to each such user as a subscriber. The number of paying subscriptions at each of our customers ranges from one to hundreds of thousands. None of our customers accounted for more than five percent of our revenues during fiscal 2012, 2011, or 2010. Subscription and support revenues are recognized ratably over the contract terms beginning on the commencement dates of each contract. The typical subscription and support term is 12 to 24 months, although terms range from one to 60 months. Our subscription and support contracts are non-cancelable, though customers typically have the right to terminate their contracts for cause if we materially fail to perform. We generally invoice our customers in advance, in annual or quarterly installments, and typical payment terms provide that our customers pay us within 30 days of invoice. Amounts that have been invoiced are recorded in accounts receivable and in deferred revenue, or in revenue depending on whether the revenue recognition criteria have been met. In general, we collect our billings in advance of the subscription service period. Professional services and other revenues consist of fees associated with consulting and implementation services and training. Our consulting and implementation engagements are typically billed on a time and materials basis. We also offer a number of training classes on implementing, using and administering our service that are billed on a per person, per class basis. Our typical professional services payment terms provide that our customers pay us within 30 days of invoice. In determining whether professional services can be accounted for separately from subscription and support revenues, we consider a number of factors, which are described in Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates  Revenue Recognition below. Prior to February 1, 2011, the deliverables in multiple-deliverable arrangements were accounted for separately if the delivered items had standalone value and there was objective and reliable evidence of fair value for the undelivered items. If the deliverables in a multiple-deliverable arrangement could not be accounted for separately, the total arrangement fee was recognized ratably as a single unit of accounting over the contracted term of the subscription agreement. A significant portion of our multiple-deliverable arrangements were accounted for as a single unit of accounting because we did not have objective and reliable evidence of fair value for certain of our deliverables. Additionally, in these situations, we deferred the direct costs of a related professional service arrangement and amortized those costs over the same period as the professional services revenue was recognized. In October 2009, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2009-13,  Revenue Recognition (Topic 605), Multiple-Deliverable Revenue Arrangementsa consensus of the FASB Emerging Issues Task Force  (ASU 2009-13) which amended the previous multiple-deliverable arrangements accounting guidance. Pursuant to the new guidance, objective and reliable evidence of fair value of the deliverables to be delivered is no longer required in order to account for deliverables in a multiple-deliverable arrangement separately. Instead, arrangement consideration is allocated to deliverables based on their relative selling price. In the first quarter of fiscal 2012, we adopted this new accounting guidance on a prospective basis. We applied the new accounting guidance to those multiple-deliverable arrangements entered into or materially modified on or after February 1, 2011 which is the beginning of our fiscal year.  Seasonal Nature of Deferred Revenue and Accounts Receivable Deferred revenue primarily consists of billings to customers for our subscription service. Over 90 percent of the value of our billings to customers is for our subscription and support service. We generally invoice our customers in either quarterly or annual cycles. There is a disproportionate weighting towards annual billings in the fourth quarter, primarily as a result of large enterprise account buying patterns. Currently, there is greater operational discipline around annual invoicing, for both new business and renewals. Occasionally, we bill customers for their multi-year contract on a single invoice which results in an increase in noncurrent deferred revenue. Our fourth quarter has historically been our strongest quarter for new business and renewals. The year on year compounding effect of this seasonality in both billing patterns and overall new and renewal business causes the value of invoices that we generate in the fourth quarter for both new business and renewals to increase as a proportion of our total annual billings. Accordingly, the sequential quarterly changes in accounts receivable and the related deferred revenue during the first three quarters of our fiscal year are not necessarily indicative of the billing activity that occurs in the fourth quarter as displayed below: ##TABLE_START (in thousands)  April 30, 2011   July 31, 2011   October 31, 2011   January 31, 2012  Fiscal 2012     Accounts receivable, net  $ 270,816   $ 342,397   $ 312,331   $ 683,745  Deferred revenue, current and noncurrent   915,133    935,266    917,821    1,380,295  (in thousands)  April 30, 2010   July 31, 2010   October 31, 2010   January 31, 2011  Fiscal 2011     Accounts receivable, net  $ 183,612   $ 228,550   $ 258,764   $ 426,943  Deferred revenue, current and noncurrent   664,529    683,019    694,557    934,941  (in thousands)  April 30, 2009   July 31, 2009   October 31, 2009   January 31, 2010  Fiscal 2010     Accounts receivable, net  $ 145,869   $ 168,842   $ 191,297   $ 320,956  Deferred revenue, current and noncurrent   549,373    549,010    545,435    704,348  ##TABLE_END Unbilled Deferred Revenue The deferred revenue balance on our consolidated balance sheet does not represent the total contract value of annual or multi-year, non-cancelable subscription agreements. Unbilled deferred revenue was over $2.2 billion as of January 31, 2012 and over $1.5 billion as of January 31, 2011. Unbilled deferred revenue represents future billings under our subscription agreements that have not been invoiced and, accordingly, are not recorded in deferred revenue. We expect that the amount of unbilled deferred revenue will change from quarter to quarter for several reasons, including the specific timing and duration of large customer subscription agreements, varying billing cycles of subscription agreements, the specific timing of customer renewals, foreign currency fluctuations, the timing of when unbilled deferred revenue is to be recognized as revenue, and changes in customer financial circumstances. For multi-year subscription agreements billed annually, the associated unbilled deferred revenue is typically high at the beginning of the contract period, zero just prior to renewal, and increases if the agreement is renewed. Low unbilled deferred revenue attributable to a particular subscription agreement is often associated with an impending renewal and may not be an indicator of the likelihood of renewal or future revenue from such customer. Accordingly, we expect that the amount of aggregate unbilled deferred revenue will change from year-to-year depending in part upon the number and dollar amount of subscription agreements at particular stages in their renewal cycle. Such fluctuations are not a reliable indicator of future revenues.  Cost of Revenues and Operating Expenses Cost of Revenues. Cost of subscription and support revenues primarily consists of expenses related to hosting our service and providing support, the costs of data center capacity, depreciation or operating lease expense associated with computer equipment and software, allocated overhead and amortization expense associated with capitalized software related to our services and acquired developed technologies. We allocate overhead such as rent and occupancy charges based on headcount. Employee benefit costs and taxes are allocated based upon a percentage of total compensation expense. As such, general overhead expenses are reflected in each cost of revenue and operating expense category. Cost of professional services and other revenues consists primarily of employee-related costs associated with these services, including stock-based expenses, the cost of subcontractors and allocated overhead. The cost of providing professional services is significantly higher as a percentage of the related revenue than for our enterprise cloud computing subscription service due to the direct labor costs and costs of subcontractors. We intend to continue to invest additional resources in our enterprise cloud computing services. For example, we plan to open additional data centers and expand our current data centers in the future. Additionally, as we acquire new businesses and technologies, the amortization expense associated with this activity will be included in cost of revenues. The timing of these additional expenses will affect our cost of revenues, both in terms of absolute dollars and as a percentage of revenues, in the affected periods. Research and Development . Research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries and related expenses, including stock-based expenses, the costs of our development and test data center and allocated overhead. We continue to focus our research and development efforts on adding new features and services, integrating acquired technologies, increasing the functionality and enhancing the ease of use of our enterprise cloud computing services. Our proprietary, scalable and secure multi-tenant architecture enables us to provide all of our customers with a service based on a single version of our application. As a result, we do not have to maintain multiple versions, which enables us to have relatively lower research and development expenses as compared to traditional enterprise software companies. We expect that in the future, research and development expenses will increase in absolute dollars as we improve and extend our service offerings, develop new technologies and integrate acquired businesses and technologies. Marketing and Sales. Marketing and sales expenses are our largest cost and consist primarily of salaries and related expenses, including stock-based expenses, for our sales and marketing staff, including commissions, payments to partners, marketing programs and allocated overhead. Marketing programs consist of advertising, events, corporate communications, brand building and product marketing activities. We plan to continue to invest in marketing and sales by expanding our domestic and international selling and marketing activities, building brand awareness, attracting new customers and sponsoring additional marketing events. We expect that in the future, marketing and sales expenses will increase in absolute dollars and continue to be our largest cost. General and Administrative. General and administrative expenses consist of salaries and related expenses, including stock-based expenses, for finance and accounting, legal, internal audit, human resources and management information systems personnel, legal costs, professional fees, other corporate expenses and allocated overhead. We expect that in the future, general and administrative expenses will increase in absolute dollars as we invest in our infrastructure and we incur additional employee related costs, professional fees and insurance costs related to the growth of our business and international expansion. We expect general and administrative costs as a percentage of total revenues to remain flat for the next several quarters. Stock-Based Expenses. Our cost of revenues and operating expenses include stock-based expenses related to equity plans for employees and non-employee directors. We recognize our stock-based compensation as an expense in the statement of operations based on their fair values and vesting periods. These charges have been significant in the past and we expect that they will increase as our stock price increases, as we hire more employees and seek to retain existing employees.  Amortization of Purchased Intangibles from business combinations . Our cost of revenues and operating expenses include amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets, such as the amortization of the cost associated with an acquired companys research and development efforts, trade names, customer lists and customer relationships. We expect this expense to increase as we acquire more companies. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, costs and expenses, and related disclosures. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates and assumptions. Our actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. We believe that of our significant accounting policies, which are described in note 1 to our consolidated financial statements, the following accounting policies involve a greater degree of judgment and complexity. Accordingly, these are the policies we believe are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our consolidated financial condition and results of operations. Revenue Recognition . We derive our revenues from two sources: (1) subscription revenues, which are comprised of subscription fees from customers accessing our enterprise cloud computing services and from customers purchasing additional support beyond the standard support that is included in the basic subscription fee; and (2) related professional services such as process mapping, project management, implementation services and other revenue. Other revenue consists primarily of training fees. We commence revenue recognition when all of the following conditions are satisfied: ##TABLE_START    There is persuasive evidence of an arrangement; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    The service has been or is being provided to the customer; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    The collection of the fees is reasonably assured; and ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    The amount of fees to be paid by the customer is fixed or determinable. ##TABLE_END Our subscription service arrangements are non-cancelable and do not contain refund-type provisions. Subscription and Support Revenues Subscription and support revenues are recognized ratably over the contract terms beginning on the commencement date of each contract, which is the date our service is made available to customers. Amounts that have been invoiced are recorded in accounts receivable and in deferred revenue or revenue, depending on whether the revenue recognition criteria have been met. Professional Services and Other Revenues The majority of our professional services contracts are on a time and material basis. When these services are not combined with subscription revenues as a single unit of accounting, as discussed below, these revenues are recognized as the services are rendered for time and material contracts, and when the milestones are achieved and accepted by the customer for fixed price contracts. Training revenues are recognized after the services are performed. Multiple-Deliverable Arrangements We enter into arrangements with multiple-deliverables that generally include subscription, premium support, and professional services.  Prior to February 1, 2011, the deliverables in multiple-deliverable arrangements were accounted for separately if the delivered items had standalone value and there was objective and reliable evidence of fair value for the undelivered items. If the deliverables in a multiple-deliverable arrangement could not be accounted for separately, the total arrangement fee was recognized ratably as a single unit of accounting over the contracted term of the subscription agreement. A significant portion of our multiple-deliverable arrangements were accounted for as a single unit of accounting because we did not have objective and reliable evidence of fair value for certain of our deliverables. Additionally, in these situations, we deferred the direct costs of a professional services arrangement and amortized those costs over the same period as the professional services revenue is recognized. In October 2009, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2009-13,  Revenue Recognition (Topic 605), Multiple-Deliverable Revenue Arrangementsa consensus of the FASB Emerging Issues Task Force  (ASU 2009-13) which amended the previous multiple-deliverable arrangements accounting guidance. Pursuant to the updated guidance, objective and reliable evidence of fair value of the deliverables to be delivered is no longer required in order to account for deliverables in a multiple-deliverable arrangement separately. Instead, arrangement consideration is allocated to deliverables based on their relative selling price. In the first quarter of fiscal 2012, we adopted this updated accounting guidance on a prospective basis. We have applied the new accounting guidance to those multiple-deliverable arrangements entered into or materially modified on or after February 1, 2011 which is the beginning of our fiscal year. The adoption of this updated accounting guidance did not have a material impact on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. As of January 31, 2012, the deferred professional services revenue and deferred costs under the previous accounting guidance are $30.5 million and $14.3 million, respectively, which will continue to be recognized over the related remaining subscription period. Under the updated accounting guidance, in order to treat deliverables in a multiple-deliverable arrangement as separate units of accounting, the deliverables must have standalone value upon delivery. If the deliverables have standalone value upon delivery, we account for each deliverable separately. Subscription services have standalone value as such services are often sold separately. In determining whether professional services have standalone value, we consider the following factors for each professional services agreement: availability of the services from other vendors, the nature of the professional services, the timing of when the professional services contract was signed in comparison to the subscription service start date, and the contractual dependence of the subscription service on the customers satisfaction with the professional services work. To date, we have concluded that all of the professional services included in multiple-deliverable arrangements executed have standalone value. Under the updated accounting guidance, when multiple-deliverables included in an arrangement are separated into different units of accounting, the arrangement consideration is allocated to the identified separate units based on a relative selling price hierarchy. We determine the relative selling price for a deliverable based on its vendor-specific objective evidence of selling price (VSOE), if available, or our best estimate of selling price (BESP), if VSOE is not available. We have determined that third-party evidence (TPE) is not a practical alternative due to differences in our service offerings compared to other parties and the availability of relevant third-party pricing information. The amount of revenue allocated to delivered items is limited by contingent revenue, if any. For certain professional services, we have established VSOE as a consistent number of standalone sales of this deliverable have been priced within a reasonably narrow range. We have not established VSOE for our subscription services due to lack of pricing consistency, the introduction of new services and other factors. Accordingly, we use our BESP to determine the relative selling price. We determined BESP by considering our overall pricing objectives and market conditions. Significant pricing practices taken into consideration include our discounting practices, the size and volume of our transactions, the customer demographic, the geographic area where our services are sold, our price lists, our  go-to-market strategy, historical standalone sales and contract prices. The determination of BESP is made through consultation with and approval by management, taking into consideration the go-to-market strategy. As our go-to-market strategies evolve, we may modify our pricing practices in the future, which could result in changes in relative selling prices, including both VSOE and BESP. Deferred Revenue. The deferred revenue balance does not represent the total contract value of annual or multi-year, non-cancelable subscription agreements. Deferred revenue primarily consists of billings or payments received in advance of revenue recognition from subscription service described above and is recognized as the revenue recognition criteria are met. We generally invoice customers in annual or quarterly installments. Deferred revenue is influenced by several factors, including seasonality, the compounding effects of renewals, invoice duration, invoice timing and new business linearity within the quarter. As a result of the updated accounting guidance previously described, billings against professional services arrangements entered into prior to February 1, 2011 were generally added to deferred revenue and recognized over the remaining related subscription contract term. Deferred revenue that will be recognized during the succeeding twelve month period is recorded as current deferred revenue and the remaining portion is recorded as noncurrent. Deferred Commissions. We defer commission payments to our direct sales force. The commissions are deferred and amortized to sales expense over the non-cancelable terms of the related subscription contracts with our customers, which are typically 12 to 24 months. The commission payments, which are paid in full the month after the customers service commences, are a direct and incremental cost of the revenue arrangements. The deferred commission amounts are recoverable through the future revenue streams under the non-cancelable customer contracts. We believe this is the preferable method of accounting as the commission charges are so closely related to the revenue from the non-cancelable customer contracts that they should be recorded as an asset and charged to expense over the same period that the subscription revenue is recognized. During fiscal 2012, we deferred $167.2 million of commission expenditures and we amortized $107.2 million to sales expense. During the same period a year ago, we deferred $121.2 million of commission expenditures and we amortized $80.2 million to sales expense. Deferred commissions on our consolidated balance sheets totaled $176.6 million at January 31, 2012 and $116.6 million at January 31, 2011. Business Combinations. We recognize separately from goodwill the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed. Goodwill as of the acquisition date represents the excess of the purchase consideration of an acquired business over the fair value of the underlying net tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed. We use our best estimates and assumptions to accurately assign fair value to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date. Our estimates are inherently uncertain and subject to refinement. As a result, during the measurement period, which may be up to one year from the acquisition date, we may record adjustments to the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed, with the corresponding offset to goodwill. Upon the conclusion of the measurement period or final determination of the fair value of assets acquired or liabilities assumed, whichever comes first, any subsequent adjustments are recorded to our consolidated statements of operations. In addition, uncertain tax positions and tax related valuation allowances assumed in connection with a business combination are initially estimated as of the acquisition date. We continue to collect information in order to determine their estimated fair values as of the date of acquisition. We reevaluate these items quarterly and record any adjustments to the preliminary estimates to goodwill provided that we are within the measurement period. Subsequent to the measurement period, changes to these uncertain tax positions and tax related valuation allowances will affect our provision for income taxes in the consolidated statements of operations.  Stock-Based Awards. We recognize the fair value of our stock awards on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period of the award which is the vesting term of generally four years or one year for the Employee Stock Purchase Plan (ESPP). The fair value of each award is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. The estimated life for the stock options is based on an actual analysis of expected life. The estimated life for the ESPP is based on the two purchase periods within the offering period. The risk free interest rate is based on the rate for a U.S. government security with the same estimated life at the time of the option grant and the stock purchase rights. We estimate the future stock price volatility considering both our observed option-implied volatilities and our historical volatility calculations. We believe this is the best estimate of the expected volatility over the expected life of our stock options and stock purchase rights. We recognized stock-based expense of $229.3 million during fiscal 2012. The requirement to expense stock-based awards will continue to materially reduce our reported results of operations. As of January 31, 2012, we had an aggregate of $820.6 million of stock compensation remaining to be amortized to expense over the remaining requisite service period of the underlying awards. We currently expect this stock compensation balance to be amortized as follows: $296.5 million during fiscal 2013; $256.4 million during fiscal 2014; $196.1 million during fiscal 2015 and $71.6 million during fiscal 2016. These amounts reflect only outstanding stock awards as of January 31, 2012 and assume no forfeiture activity. We expect to continue to issue stock-based awards to our employees in future periods, which will increase the stock compensation amortization in such future periods. We recognize as an operating expense the payroll and social tax costs, as applicable by jurisdiction, when stock options are exercised. The impact of stock-based expense in the future is dependent upon, among other things, the timing of when we hire additional employees, the effect of long-term incentive strategies involving stock awards in order to continue to attract and retain employees, the total number of stock awards granted, the fair value of the stock awards at the time of grant, changes in estimated forfeiture assumption rates. Additionally, we are required to use an option-pricing model to determine the fair value of stock-based awards. This determination of fair value is affected by our stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of highly complex and subjective variables. These variables include, but are not limited to, our expected stock price volatility over the term of the awards. As of January 31, 2012, there were 5.0 million restricted stock awards and units outstanding. We plan to continue awarding restricted stock to our employees in the future. The restricted stock, which upon vesting entitles the holder to one share of common stock for each restricted stock, has an exercise price of $0.001 per share, which is equal to the par value of our common stock, and vests over four years. The fair value of the restricted stock is based on our closing stock price on the date of grant, and compensation expense, net of estimated forfeitures, is recognized on a straight-line basis over the vesting period. Income Taxes. We account for income taxes using the liability method, which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets or liabilities for the tax-effected temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of our assets and liabilities and for net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. The tax expense or benefit for unusual items, or certain adjustments to the valuation allowance are treated as discrete items in the interim period in which the events occur. Our effective tax rate could be adversely affected by changes in the mix of earnings and losses in countries with differing statutory tax rates, certain non-deductible expenses as a result of acquisitions, compensation, the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities and changes in tax laws and accounting principles. Our tax positions are subject to income tax audits by multiple tax jurisdictions throughout the world. We recognize the tax benefit of an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the position is sustainable upon examination by the taxing authority, based on the technical merits. The tax benefit recognized is  measured as the largest amount of benefit which is greater than 50 percent likely to be realized upon settlement with the taxing authority. We recognize interest accrued and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in our tax provision. Strategic Investments . We report our investments in marketable equity securities at fair market value using the quoted prices in their respective active markets. We report our investments in non-marketable equity and debt securities, which consist of minority equity and debt investments in privately-held companies, at cost or fair value when an event or circumstance indicates an other-than-temporary decline in value has occurred. Management evaluates financial results, earnings trends, technology milestones and subsequent financing of these companies, as well as the general market conditions to identify indicators of other-than temporary impairment.

percent. Subscription and support revenues were $2.1 billion, or 94 percent of total revenues, for fiscal 2012, compared to $1.6 billion, or 94 percent of total revenues, during the same period a year ago. The increase in subscription and support revenues was due primarily to new customers, upgrades and additional subscriptions from existing customers and improved renewal rates as compared to a year ago. The price per user per month for our three primary offerings, Professional Edition, Enterprise Edition and Unlimited Edition, in fiscal 2012 has generally remained consistent relative to fiscal 2011. Professional services and other revenues were $140.3 million, or six percent of total revenues, for fiscal 2012, compared to $106.0 million, or six percent of total revenues, for the same period a year ago. The increase in professional services and other revenues was due primarily to the improved utilization of existing headcount and a benefit from the prospective adoption of the new revenue accounting guidance for multiple-deliverable arrangements. Revenues in Europe and Asia Pacific accounted for $726.3 million, or 32 percent of total revenues, for fiscal 2012, compared to $522.1 million, or 32 percent of total revenues, during the same period a year ago, an increase of $204.1 million, or 39 percent. The increase in revenues outside of the Americas was the result of the increasing acceptance of our service, our focus on marketing our services internationally and improved renewal rates. Additionally, the value of the U.S. dollar relative to foreign currencies contributed to a slight increase in U.S. dollar revenues outside of the Americas for fiscal 2012 as compared to the same period a year ago. The foreign currency impact had the effect of increasing our aggregate revenues by $36.9 million compared to the same period a year ago. As part of our overall growth, we expect the percentage of our revenue generated outside of the Americas to increase as a percentage of our total revenues worldwide. Cost of Revenues. ##TABLE_START   Fiscal Year Ended January 31,   Variance Dollars  (In thousands)  2012   2011   Subscription and support  $ 360,758   $ 208,243   $ 152,515  Professional services and other   128,128    115,570    12,558        Total cost of revenues  $ 488,886   $ 323,813   $ 165,073        Percent of total revenues   22 %   20 %  ##TABLE_END Cost of revenues was $488.9 million, or 22 percent of total revenues, during fiscal 2012, compared to $323.8 million, or 20 percent of total revenues, during the same period a year ago, an increase of $165.1 million. The increase in absolute dollars was primarily due to an increase of $20.4 million in employee-related costs, an increase of $5.3 million in stock based expenses, an increase of $39.8 million in service delivery costs, primarily due to our efforts to increase data center capacity, an increase of $68.3 million in depreciation and amortization expenses, $44.6 million of which related to the amortization of purchased intangible assets, an increase of $24.2 million in outside subcontractor and other service costs, and an increase of $5.5 million in allocated overhead. Gross profit margins for professional services and other revenues improved over the same period a year ago primarily due to the improved utilization of existing headcount and a benefit from the prospective adoption of the new revenue accounting guidance for multiple-deliverable arrangements.  We intend to continue to invest additional resources in our enterprise cloud computing services and data center capacity. Additionally, the amortization of purchased intangible assets will increase as we acquire additional businesses and technologies. We also plan to add additional employees in our professional services group to facilitate the adoption of our services. The timing of these expenses will affect our cost of revenues, both in terms of absolute dollars and as a percentage of revenues in future periods. Research and Development. ##TABLE_START   Fiscal Year Ended January 31,   Variance Dollars  (In thousands)  2012   2011   Research and development  $ 295,347   $ 187,887   $ 107,460  Percent of total revenues   13 %   11 %  ##TABLE_END Research and development expenses were $295.3 million, or 13 percent of total revenues, during fiscal 2012, compared to $187.9 million, or 11 percent of total revenues, during the same period a year ago, an increase of $107.5 million. The increase in absolute dollars was primarily due to an increase of $66.7 million in employee-related costs, an increase of $27.0 million in stock-based expenses, an increase of $2.2 million in our development and test data center, an increase of $1.4 million in depreciation and amortization expenses and an increase of $8.6 million in allocated overhead. We increased our research and development headcount by 52 percent since January 31, 2011 in order to improve and extend our service offerings and develop new technologies. Some of the increase in headcount was due to acquired businesses. Marketing and Sales. ##TABLE_START   Fiscal Year Ended January 31,   Variance Dollars  (In thousands)  2012   2011   Marketing and sales  $ 1,169,610   $ 792,029   $ 377,581  Percent of total revenues   52 %   48 %  ##TABLE_END Marketing and sales expenses were $1,169.6 million, or 52 percent of total revenues, during fiscal 2012, compared to $792.0 million, or 48 percent of total revenues, during the same period a year ago, an increase of $377.6 million. The increase in absolute dollars was primarily due to increases of $255.6 million in employee-related costs, $59.3 million in stock-based expenses, $22.5 million in advertising, marketing and event costs, $21.8 million in allocated overhead, $8.2 million in outside subcontractor and other service costs, $3.1 million in depreciation and amortization and the preliminary settlement of the California wage and hour case discussed in Note 8. Our marketing and sales headcount increased by 44 percent since January 31, 2011 as we hired additional sales personnel to focus on adding new customers and increasing penetration within our existing customer base. Some of the increase in headcount was due to acquired businesses.

The increase was primarily due to increases of $57.5 million in employee-related costs, $17.3 million in stock-based expenses and $14.3 million in professional and outside service costs. Our general and administrative headcount increased by 46 percent since January 31, 2011 as we added personnel to support our growth.

Investment income was $23.3 million during fiscal 2012 and was $37.7 million during the same period a year ago. The decrease was primarily due to a reduction in realized gains from sales of marketable securities, the decrease in marketable securities balances and lower interest rates. Interest expense. ##TABLE_START   Fiscal Year Ended January 31,   Variance Dollars  (In thousands)  2012   2011   Interest expense  $ (17,045 )  $ (24,909 )  $ 7,864  Percent of total revenues   (1 )%   (2 )%  ##TABLE_END Interest expense consists of interest on our convertible senior notes and capital leases. Interest expense was $17.0 million, net of interest costs capitalized, during fiscal 2012 and was $24.9 million during the same period a year ago. During fiscal 2012, we capitalized $14.6 million of interest costs related to capital projects, specifically costs related to our real estate holdings, which began during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011, and our capitalized internal-use software development costs. Capitalized interest during the same period a year ago was $4.0 million. Other expense. ##TABLE_START   Fiscal Year Ended January 31,   Variance Dollars  (In thousands)  2012   2011   Other expense  $ (4,455 )  $ (6,025 )  $ 1,570  ##TABLE_END Other expense primarily consists of realized gains and losses resulting from strategic investment activity and foreign currency transaction gains and losses. Other expense decreased primarily due to the net gain of $2.9 million from activity within our portfolio of noncontrolling equity and debt investments in privately-held companies offset by realized and unrealized losses on foreign currency transactions for fiscal 2012 compared to the same period a year ago.  Benefit (provision) for income taxes. ##TABLE_START   Fiscal Year Ended January 31,   Variance Dollars  (In thousands)  2012   2011   Benefit (provision) for income taxes  $ 21,745   $ (34,601 )  $ 56,346  Effective tax rate   65 %   33 %  ##TABLE_END The benefit for income taxes was $21.7 million during fiscal 2012, compared to an income tax provision of $34.6 million during the same period a year ago. Our effective tax rate was 65 percent for fiscal 2012 compared to 33 percent for the same period a year ago. The higher tax rate was primarily attributable to an increase in federal and California tax credits and a tax benefit related to the May 2011 acquisition of Radian6. The combined effect of these tax benefits was partially offset by an increase in foreign tax rate differential. Foreign tax expense relative to our fiscal 2012 pre-tax loss was higher as compared to foreign tax expense relative to our fiscal 2011 pre-tax income. The combined effect of these items on a small net loss before income taxes resulted in a comparatively higher fiscal 2012 effective tax rate. The lower fiscal 2012 state tax rate was primarily attributable to two items. First, California enacted several income tax law changes, which generally benefited California-based companies. The result of this tax law change substantially reduced our state effective tax rate. Second, the company was subject to minimum state taxes, which reduced the state tax benefit. The combined effect of these tax items was an overall small fiscal 2012 state tax benefit. Note that we separately recorded an income tax expense of $2.2 million in fiscal 2011 to re-value the anticipated future tax effects of our California temporary differences related to this tax law change. We also receive certain tax incentives in Switzerland and Singapore in the form of reduced tax rates. These temporary tax reduction programs will expire in 2016 and 2014 respectively. The Singapore program is eligible for renewal. The total income tax benefit recognized in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations related to stock-based compensation was $76.0 million for fiscal 2012. See Note 6 Income Taxes to the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for our reconciliation of income taxes at the statutory federal rate to the provision for income taxes. Fiscal Years Ended January 31, 2011 and 2010 Revenues. ##TABLE_START (In thousands)  Fiscal Year Ended January 31,   Variance   2011   2010   Dollars   Percent  Subscription and support  $ 1,551,145   $ 1,209,472   $ 341,673    28 % Professional services and other   105,994    96,111    9,883    10 %         Total revenues  $ 1,657,139   $ 1,305,583   $ 351,556    27 %         ##TABLE_END Total revenues were $1.7 billion for fiscal 2011, compared to $1.3 billion during fiscal 2010, an increase of $351.6 million, or 27 percent. Subscription and support revenues were $1.6 billion, or 94 percent of total revenues, for fiscal 2011, compared to $1.2 billion, or 93 percent of total revenues, during fiscal 2010. The increase in subscription and support revenues was due primarily to new customers, upgrades and additional subscriptions from existing customers and improved renewal rates as compared to fiscal 2010. The price per user per month for our three primary offerings, Professional Edition, Enterprise Edition and Unlimited Edition, in fiscal 2011 has generally remained consistent relative to fiscal 2010. Professional services and other revenues were $106.0 million, or 6 percent of total revenues, for fiscal 2011, compared to $96.1 million, or 7 percent of total revenues, for fiscal 2010. The increase in professional services and other revenues was due primarily to the higher demand for services from an increased number of customers.  Revenues in Europe and Asia Pacific accounted for $522.1 million, or 32 percent of total revenues, for fiscal 2011, compared to $381.8 million, or 29 percent of total revenues, during fiscal 2010, an increase of $140.3 million, or 37 percent. The increase in revenues outside of the Americas was the result of the increasing acceptance of our service, and our focus on marketing our service internationally. Additionally, the value of the U.S. dollar relative to foreign currencies contributed to a slight decrease in U.S. dollar revenues outside of the Americas for fiscal 2011 as compared to fiscal 2010. The foreign currency impact had the effect of reducing our aggregate revenues by $7.6 million compared to fiscal 2010. Cost of Revenues. ##TABLE_START   Fiscal Year Ended January 31,   Variance Dollars  (In thousands)  2011   2010   Subscription and support  $ 208,243   $ 159,172   $ 49,071  Professional services and other   115,570    98,753    16,817        Total cost of revenues  $ 323,813   $ 257,925   $ 65,888        Percent of total revenues   20 %   20 %  ##TABLE_END Cost of revenues was $323.8 million, or 20 percent of total revenues, during fiscal 2011, compared to $257.9 million, or 20 percent of total revenues, during fiscal 2010, an increase of $65.9 million. The increase in absolute dollars was primarily due to an increase of $22.6 million in employee-related costs, an increase of $9.2 million in service delivery costs, primarily due to our efforts in increasing data center capacity, an increase of $16.6 million in depreciation and amortization expenses, an increase of $13.2 million in outside subcontractor and other service costs, and an increase of $3.6 million in allocated overhead, offset by a decrease of $0.4 million in stock based expenses. The cost of professional services and other revenues exceeded the related revenue during fiscal 2011 by $9.6 million as compared to $2.6 million during fiscal 2010, primarily due to an increase in the cost related to professional services headcount. Research and Development. ##TABLE_START   Fiscal Year Ended January 31,   Variance Dollars  (In thousands)  2011   2010   Research and development  $ 187,887   $ 131,897   $ 55,990  Percent of total revenues   11 %   10 %  ##TABLE_END Research and development expenses were $187.9 million, or 11 percent of total revenues, during fiscal 2011, compared to $131.9 million, or 10 percent of total revenues, during fiscal 2010, an increase of $56.0 million. The increase in absolute dollars was due to an increase of $42.0 million in employee-related costs, an increase of $5.8 million in stock-based expenses, and an increase of $5.6 million in allocated overhead. We increased our research and development headcount by 47 percent since January 31, 2010 in order to upgrade and extend our service offerings and develop new technologies. Some of the increase in headcount was due to acquired businesses. Marketing and Sales. ##TABLE_START   Fiscal Year Ended January 31,   Variance Dollars  (In thousands)  2011   2010   Marketing and sales  $ 792,029   $ 605,199   $ 186,830  Percent of total revenues   48 %   46 %  ##TABLE_END  Marketing and sales expenses were $792.0 million, or 48 percent of total revenues, during fiscal 2011, compared to $605.2 million, or 46 percent of total revenues, during fiscal 2010, an increase of $186.8 million. The increase in absolute dollars was primarily due to increases of $143.1 million in employee-related costs, $16.7 million in stock-based expenses, $12.1 million in advertising costs and marketing and event costs, $1.0 million in depreciation and amortization, and $12.6 million in allocated overhead. Our marketing and sales headcount increased by 34 percent since January 31, 2010 as we hired additional sales personnel to focus on adding new customers and increasing penetration within our existing customer base. Some of the increase in headcount was due to acquired businesses. General and Administrative. ##TABLE_START   Fiscal Year Ended January 31,   Variance Dollars  (In thousands)  2011   2010   General and administrative  $ 255,913   $ 195,290   $ 60,623  Percent of total revenues   15 %   15 %  ##TABLE_END General and administrative expenses were $255.9 million, or 15 percent of total revenues, during fiscal 2011, compared to $195.3 million, or 15 percent of total revenues, during fiscal 2010, an increase of $60.6 million. The increase was primarily due to increases of $46.8 million in employee-related costs, $9.5 million in stock-based expenses, and increases in depreciation and amortization, service delivery costs, and professional and outside service costs. Our general and administrative headcount increased by 30 percent since January 31, 2010 as we added personnel to support our growth. Income from operations. ##TABLE_START   Fiscal Year Ended January 31,   Variance Dollars  (In thousands)  2011   2010   Income from operations  $ 97,497   $ 115,272   $ (17,775 ) Percent of total revenues   6 %   9 %  ##TABLE_END Income from operations during fiscal 2011 was $97.5 million and included $120.4 million of stock-based expenses and $19.7 million of amortization of purchased intangibles. During fiscal 2010, operating income was $115.3 million and included $88.9 million of stock-based expenses and $11.3 million of amortization of purchased intangibles. Investment income. ##TABLE_START   Fiscal Year Ended January 31,   Variance Dollars  (In thousands)  2011   2010   Investment income  $ 37,735   $ 30,408   $ 7,327  Percent of total revenues   2 %   2 %  ##TABLE_END Investment income consists of income on cash and marketable securities balances. Investment income was $37.7 million during fiscal 2011 and was $30.4 million during fiscal 2010. The increase was primarily due to the increase in marketable securities balances resulting from cash generated by operating activities and the proceeds from stock option exercises and the convertible senior notes. Interest expense. ##TABLE_START   Fiscal Year Ended January 31,   Variance Dollars  (In thousands)  2011   2010   Interest expense  $ (24,909 )  $ (2,000 )  $ (22,909 ) Percent of total revenues   2 %   0 %  ##TABLE_END  Interest expense consists of interest on our convertible senior notes and capital leases. Interest expense was $24.9 million, net of interest costs capitalized, during fiscal 2011 and was $2.0 million during fiscal 2010. The increase was primarily due to interest expense associated with the January 2010 issuance of $575.0 million of convertible senior notes and capital leases associated with equipment acquired to expand our data center capacity. During fiscal 2011, we capitalized $4.0 million of interest costs related to major capital projects, specifically our campus project and our capitalized internal-use software development costs. Other expense. ##TABLE_START   Fiscal Year Ended January 31,   Variance Dollars  (In thousands)  2011   2010   Other expense  $ (6,025 )  $ (1,299 )  $ (4,726 ) ##TABLE_END Other expense primarily consists of foreign currency transaction gains and losses. Other expense increased due to realized and unrealized gains on foreign currency transactions for fiscal 2011 compared to fiscal 2010. Provision for income taxes. ##TABLE_START   Fiscal Year Ended January 31,   Variance Dollars  (In thousands)  2011   2010   Provision for income taxes  $ (34,601 )  $ (57,689 )  $ 23,088  Effective tax rate   33 %   41 %  ##TABLE_END The provision for income taxes was $34.6 million during fiscal 2011, compared to $57.7 million during fiscal 2010. Our effective tax rate decreased to 33 percent for fiscal 2011 compared to 41 percent for fiscal 2010. The decrease was due to a higher proportion of income being generated in countries with lower income tax rates than the U.S statutory tax rate, as well as increased tax credits. The extension of the federal research credit provision was enacted in the Tax Relief Act of 2010. The total income tax benefit recognized in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations related to stock-based compensation was $44.1 million for fiscal 2011. See Note 6 Income Taxes to the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for our reconciliation of income taxes at the statutory federal rate to the provision for income taxes. In addition, in February 2009, the State of California enacted several income tax law changes which included an election to apply a single sales factor apportionment formula and adoption of a market sourcing approach for service income impacted us beginning in fiscal 2012. As a result, we re-valued the anticipated future tax effects of our California temporary differences including stock-based compensation and purchased intangibles. Accordingly, we recorded an income tax expense of $2.2 million and $2.7 million related to this tax law change during fiscal 2011 and 2010 respectively. New Accounting Pronouncements In December 2010, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2010-29, Disclosure of Supplementary Pro Forma Information for Business Combinations (Topic 805)  Business Combinations (ASU 2010-29), to improve consistency in how the pro forma disclosures are calculated. Additionally, ASU 2010-29 enhances the disclosure requirements and requires description of the nature and amount of any material, nonrecurring pro forma adjustments directly attributable to a business combination. ASU 2010-29 is effective for us in fiscal 2013 and should be applied prospectively to business combinations for which the acquisition date is after the effective date. We do not believe the impact of the pending adoption of ASU 2010-29 will have a significant effect on our consolidated financial statements.  In June 2011, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2011-05, Comprehensive Income (Topic 220)Presentation of Comprehensive Income (ASU 2011-05), to require an entity to present the total of comprehensive income, the components of net income, and the components of other comprehensive income either in a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements. ASU 2011-05 eliminates the option to present the components of other comprehensive income as part of the statement of equity. ASU 2011-05 is effective for us in fiscal 2013 and should be applied retrospectively. We do not believe the impact of the pending adoption of ASU 2011-05 will have a significant effect on the consolidated financial statements. Liquidity and Capital Resources At January 31, 2012, our principal sources of liquidity were cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaling $1.4 billion and accounts receivable of $683.7 million. Net cash provided by operating activities was $591.5 million during fiscal 2012 and $459.1 million during the same period a year ago. Cash provided by operating activities has historically been affected by: the amount of net income (loss); sales of subscriptions, support and professional services; changes in working capital accounts, particularly increases and seasonality in accounts receivable and deferred revenue as described above, the timing of commission and bonus payments, and the timing of collections from large enterprise customers; add-backs of non-cash expense items such as depreciation and amortization, amortization of debt discount and the expense associated with stock-based awards. Net cash used in investing activities was $489.7 million during fiscal 2012 and $1.1 billion during the same period a year ago. The net cash used in investing activities during fiscal 2012 primarily related to the purchase of Model Metrics in December 2011, the purchase of Assistly in September 2011, the purchase of Radian6 in May 2011, the purchase of Manymoon in February 2011, investment of cash balances, capital expenditures and strategic investments offset by proceeds from sales and maturities of marketable securities. Net cash provided by financing activities was $75.9 million during fiscal 2012 and $14.1 million during the same period a year ago. Net cash provided by financing activities during fiscal 2012 consisted primarily of $116.6 million of proceeds from equity plans and $6.0 million of excess tax benefits from employee stock plans, offset by $30.5 million of principal payments on capital leases and $16.2 million of contingent consideration payments. In January 2010, we issued $575.0 million of 0.75% convertible senior notes due January 15, 2015 (the Notes) and concurrently entered into convertible notes hedges (the Note Hedges) and separate warrant transactions (the Warrants). The Notes will mature on January 15, 2015, unless earlier converted. For 20 trading days during the 30 consecutive trading days ended October 31, 2011, our common stock traded at a price exceeding 130% of the conversion price of $85.36 per share applicable to the Notes. Accordingly, the Notes were convertible at the holders option for the quarter ending January 31, 2012. The Notes are classified as a current liability on our consolidated balance sheet so long as the Notes are convertible. Upon conversion of any Notes, we will deliver cash up to the principal amount of the Notes and, with respect to any excess conversion value greater than the principal amount of the Notes, shares of our common stock, cash, or a combination of both. For 20 trading days during the 30 consecutive trading days ended January 31, 2012, our common stock did not exceed 130% of the conversion price of $85.36 per share applicable to the Notes. Accordingly, the Notes will not be convertible at the holders option for the quarter ending April 30, 2012 and will be reclassified as a noncurrent liability on our consolidated balance sheet so long as the Notes are not convertible. Our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities are comprised primarily of corporate notes and obligations, U.S. agency obligations, U.S. treasury securities, mortgage backed securities, collateralized mortgage obligations, time deposits, money market mutual funds, government obligations and municipal securities.  As of January 31, 2012, we have a total of $17.5 million in letters of credit outstanding in favor of certain landlords for office space. To date, no amounts have been drawn against the letters of credit, which renew annually and mature at various dates through April 2030. We do not have any special purpose entities, and other than operating leases for office space and computer equipment, we do not engage in off-balance sheet financing arrangements. Additionally, we currently do not have a bank line of credit. Our principal commitments consist of obligations under leases for office space and co-location facilities for data center capacity and our development and test data center, and computer equipment and furniture and fixtures. At January 31, 2012, the future non-cancelable minimum payments under these commitments were as follows: ##TABLE_START (In thousands) Contractual Obligations  Payments Due by Period   Total   Less than 1 Year   1-3 Years   3-5 Years   More than 5 Years  Capital lease obligations  $ 60,997   $ 27,585   $ 30,125   $ 3,287   $ 0  Operating lease obligations:      Facilities space   607,738    91,625    148,080    117,718    250,315  Computer equipment and furniture and fixtures   60,082    32,622    27,460    0    0  Convertible Senior Notes, including interest   587,938    4,313    583,625    0    0  Contractual commitments   200    100    100    0    0  ##TABLE_END Our lease agreements provide us with the option to renew. Our future operating lease obligations would change if we exercised these options and if we entered into additional operating lease agreements as we expand our operations. Purchase orders are not included in the table above. Our purchase orders represent authorizations to purchase rather than binding agreements. The contractual commitment amounts in the table above are associated with agreements that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms, including: fixed or minimum services to be used; fixed, minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. Obligations under contracts that we can cancel without a significant penalty are not included in the table above. In January 2012, we entered into an office lease agreement to lease approximately 400,000 rentable square feet at 50 Fremont Street, San Francisco, CA. The cost of the lease is approximately $209.0 million over the 18-year term of the lease. We will take possession of the premises in phases beginning April 1, 2012. Our commitment is included in the table above. On June 7, 2011, we entered into a preliminary settlement agreement with respect to a California state wage and hour lawsuit that had been filed against us early in 2011 in the Superior Court of California, County of San Francisco. The settlement agreement is subject to approval of the court, which is expected to rule by mid 2012. Our current estimate of the expense charge for the settlement is approximately $0.04 per diluted share. This charge is reflected in our financial results for fiscal 2012. We anticipate making a tax payment of approximately $40.0 million during the first quarter of fiscal 2013 as a result of the Radian6 transaction. Besides the aforementioned Radian6 tax payment, the timing of tax settlements are not included in the table above. We are unable to make a reasonable estimate of the timing of payments in individual years beyond 12 months due to uncertainties in the timing of tax settlements. For further information, see Note 6 to the notes to consolidated financial statements. We believe our existing cash, cash equivalents and short-term marketable securities and cash provided by operating activities will be sufficient to meet our working capital and capital expenditure needs over the next 12 months.  During fiscal 2013, we may enter into arrangements to acquire or invest in complementary businesses or joint ventures, services and technologies, and intellectual property rights. We may be required to seek additional equity or debt financing. Additional funds may not be available on terms favorable to us or at all. Non-GAAP Financial Measures Regulation S-K Item 10(e), Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures in Commission Filings, defines and prescribes the conditions for use of non-GAAP financial information. Our measures of non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP operating profit, non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP earnings per share each meet the definition of a non-GAAP financial measure. Non-GAAP gross profit, Non-GAAP operating profit and Non-GAAP net income We use the non-GAAP measures of non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP operating profit and non-GAAP net income to provide an additional view of operational performance by excluding non-cash expenses that are not directly related to performance in any particular period. We use these non-GAAP measures when planning, monitoring, and evaluating our performance. We believe that these non-GAAP measures reflect our ongoing business in a manner that allows for meaningful period-to-period comparisons and analysis of trends in our business, as they exclude certain expenses. These certain expenses are excluded because the decisions which gave rise to these expenses are not made to increase revenue in a particular period, but are made for our long-term benefit over multiple periods and we are not able to change or affect these items in any particular period. We define non-GAAP net income as our total net income excluding the following components, which we believe are not reflective of our ongoing operational expenses. In each case, for the reasons set forth below, we believe that excluding the component provides useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating the impact of certain non-cash items to our operating results and future prospects in the same manner as us, in comparing financial results across accounting periods and to those of peer companies and to better understand the impact of these non-cash items on our gross margin and operating performance. ##TABLE_START    Stock-Based Expenses . The companys compensation strategy includes the use of stock-based compensation to attract and retain employees and executives. It is principally aimed at aligning their interests with those of our stockholders and at long-term employee retention, rather than to motivate or reward operational performance for any particular period. Thus, stock-based compensation expense varies for reasons that are generally unrelated to operational decisions and performance in any particular period. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    Amortization of Purchased Intangibles. The company views amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets, such as the amortization of the cost associated with an acquired companys research and development efforts, trade names, customer lists and customer relationships, as items arising from pre-acquisition activities determined at the time of an acquisition. While it is continually viewed for impairment, amortization of the cost of purchased intangibles is a static expense, one that is not typically affected by operations during any particular period. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    Amortization of Debt Discount. Under GAAP, certain convertible debt instruments that may be settled in cash (or other assets) on conversion are required to be separately accounted for as liability (debt) and equity (conversion option) components of the instrument in a manner that reflects the issuers non-convertible debt borrowing rate. Accordingly, for GAAP purposes we are required to recognize imputed interest expense on the companys $575 million of convertible subordinated notes that were issued in a private placement in January 2010. The imputed interest rate is approximately 5.9%, while the coupon interest rate is 0.75%. The difference between the imputed interest expense and the coupon interest expense, net of the interest amount capitalized, is excluded from managements assessment of the companys operating performance because management believes that this non-cash expense is not indicative of ongoing operating performance. Management believes that the exclusion of the non-cash interest expense provides investors an enhanced view of the companys operational performance. ##TABLE_END  ##TABLE_START    Income Tax Effects. The companys non-GAAP effective tax rate excludes the tax effect of the expense items described above. ##TABLE_END We define non-GAAP gross profit as our total revenues less cost of revenues, as reported on our consolidated statement of operations, excluding the portions of stock-based expenses and amortization of purchased intangibles, as described above, that are included in cost of revenues. We define non-GAAP operating profit as our gross profit less operating expenses, as reported on our consolidated statement of operations, excluding the portions of stock-based expenses and amortization of purchased intangibles, as described above, that are included in operating expenses. Non-GAAP earnings per share Management uses the non-GAAP earnings per share to provide an additional view of performance by excluding expenses that are not directly related to performance in any particular period in the earnings per share calculation. We define non-GAAP earnings per share as our non-GAAP net income, which excludes the above components, which we believe are not reflective of our ongoing operational expenses, divided by basic or diluted shares outstanding. Limitations on the use of Non-GAAP financial measures A limitation of our non-GAAP financial measures of non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP operating profit, non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP earnings per share is that they do not have uniform definitions. Our definitions will likely differ from the definitions used by other companies, including peer companies, and therefore comparability may be limited. Thus, our non-GAAP measures of non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP operating profit, non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP earnings per share should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, or in isolation from, measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. Additionally, in the case of stock-based expense, if we did not pay a portion of compensation in the form of stock-based expense, the cash salary expense included in costs of revenues and operating expenses would be higher which would affect our cash position. We compensate for these limitations by reconciling non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP operating profit, non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP earnings per share to the most comparable GAAP financial measure. Management encourages investors and others to review our financial information in its entirety, not to rely on any single financial measure and to view our non-GAAP financial measures in conjunction with the most comparable GAAP financial measures.

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK ##TABLE_END Foreign currency exchange risk Our results of operations and cash flows are subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates, particularly changes in the Euro, British Pound Sterling and Japanese Yen. We seek to minimize the impact of certain foreign currency fluctuations by hedging certain balance sheet exposures with foreign currency forward contracts. Any gain or loss from settling these contracts is offset by the loss or gain derived from the underlying balance sheet exposures. In accordance with our policy, the hedging contracts we enter into have maturities of less than three months. Additionally, by policy, we do not enter into any hedging contracts for trading or speculative purposes. Interest rate sensitivity We had cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaling $1.4 billion at January 31, 2012. This amount was invested primarily in money market funds, time deposits, corporate notes and bonds, government securities and other debt securities with credit ratings of at least single A or better. The cash, cash equivalents and short-term marketable securities are held for working capital purposes. Our investments are made for capital preservation purposes. We do not enter into investments for trading or speculative purposes. Our cash equivalents and our portfolio of marketable securities are subject to market risk due to changes in interest rates. Fixed rate securities may have their market value adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates, while floating rate securities may produce less income than expected if interest rates fall. Due in part to these factors, our future investment income may fall short of expectation due to changes in interest rates or we may suffer losses in principal if we are forced to sell securities that decline in market value due to changes in interest rates. However because we classify our debt securities as available for sale, no gains or losses are recognized due to changes in interest rates unless such securities are sold prior to maturity or declines in fair value are determined to be other-than-temporary. Our fixed-income portfolio is subject to interest rate risk. An immediate increase or decrease in interest rates of 100-basis points at January 31, 2012 could result in a $12.1 million market value reduction or increase of the same amount. This estimate is based on a sensitivity model that measures market value changes when changes in interest rates occur. Fluctuations in the value of our investment securities caused by a change in interest rates (gains or losses on the carrying value) are recorded in other comprehensive income, and are realized only if we sell the underlying securities. At January 31, 2011, we had cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaling $1.4 billion. The fixed-income portfolio was also subject to interest rate risk. Changes in interest rates of 100-basis points would have resulted in market value changes of $27.7 million. Market Risk and Market Interest Risk In January 2010, we issued at par value $575.0 million of 0.75% convertible senior notes due 2015 (the Notes). Holders may convert their Notes prior to maturity upon the occurrence of certain circumstances. Upon conversion, we would pay the holder an amount of cash equal to the principal amount of the Notes. Amounts in excess of the principal amount, if any, may be paid in cash or stock at our option. Concurrent with the issuance of the Notes, we entered into separate note hedging transactions and the sale of warrants. These separate transactions were completed to reduce the potential economic dilution from the conversion of the Notes. For the three months ended January 31, 2012 the Notes were convertible at the option of the noteholder. For 20 trading days during the 30 consecutive trading days ended January 31, 2012, our common stock traded did not exceed 130% of the conversion price of $85.36 per share applicable to the Notes. Accordingly, the Notes will not be convertible at the holders option for the quarter ending April 30, 2012 and will be reclassified as a noncurrent liability on our consolidated balance sheet so long as the Notes are not convertible.  The Notes have a fixed annual interest rate of 0.75% and therefore, we do not have economic interest rate exposure on the Notes. However, the value of the Notes are exposed to interest rate risk. Generally, the fair market value of our fixed interest rate Notes will increase as interest rates fall and decrease as interest rates rise. In addition, the fair value of our Notes is affected by our stock price. The carrying value of our Notes was $496.1 million as of January 31, 2012. This represents the liability component of the $575.0 million principal balance as of January 31, 2012. The total estimated fair value of our Notes at January 31, 2012 was $869.5 million and the fair value was determined based on the closing trading price per $100 of the Notes as of the last day of trading for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012, which was $151.25. We have an investment portfolio that includes strategic investments in public and privately-held companies, many of which are in the development stage. When our ownership interests are less than 20 percent and we do not have the ability to exert significant influence, we account for investments in non-marketable equity and debt securities of the privately-held companies using the cost method of accounting. Otherwise, we account for the investments using the equity method of accounting. As of January 31, 2012 and 2011 the fair value of these investments was $48.3 million and $21.1 million, respectively.  ##TABLE_START ", "8": " ITEM 8.

Our audits also included the financial statement schedule listed in the Index at Item 15(c). These financial statements and schedule are the responsibility of the Companys management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and schedule based on our audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit also includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of salesforce.com, inc. at January 31, 2012 and 2011, and the consolidated results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended January 31, 2012, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Also, in our opinion, the related financial statement schedule, when considered in relation to the basic financial statements taken as a whole, presents fairly in all material respects the information set forth therein. We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), salesforce.com, incs internal control over financial reporting as of January 31, 2012, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated March 9, 2012 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon. /s/ E RNST  Y OUNG LLP San Jose, California March 9, 2012  REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM The Board of Directors and Stockholders of salesforce.com, inc. We have audited salesforce.com, inc.s internal control over financial reporting as of January 31, 2012, based on criteria established in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (the COSO criteria). Salesforce.com, inc.s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Managements Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the companys internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. A companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. In our opinion, salesforce.com, inc. maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of January 31, 2012, based on the COSO criteria . We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated balance sheets of salesforce.com, inc as of January 31, 2012 and 2011, and the related consolidated statements of operations, stockholders equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended January 31, 2012 of salesforce.com, inc. and our report dated March 9, 2012 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon. /s/ E RNST  Y OUNG LLP San Jose, California March 9, 2012  salesforce.com, inc.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements 1. Summary of Business and Significant Accounting Policies Description of Business Salesforce.com, inc. (the Company) is a leading provider of enterprise cloud computing and social enterprise solutions. The Company is dedicated to helping customers of all sizes and industries worldwide transform themselves into social enterprises. Social enterprises leverage social, mobile and open technologies to place their customers and employees at the center of their business and to engage and collaborate with them in new and powerful ways. Fiscal Year The Companys fiscal year ends on January 31. References to fiscal 2012, for example, refer to the fiscal year ending January 31, 2012. Use of Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions in the Companys consolidated financial statements and notes thereto. Significant estimates and assumptions made by management include the determination of: ##TABLE_START    the best estimate of selling price of the deliverables included in multiple-deliverable revenue arrangements, ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed for business combinations, ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    recognition and measurement of current and deferred income taxes, ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    the fair value of stock awards issued and ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    the valuation of strategic investments and the determination of other-than-temporary impairments. ##TABLE_END Actual results could differ materially from those estimates. Principles of Consolidation The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly owned subsidiaries. All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. Segments The Company operates as one operating segment. Operating segments are defined as components of an enterprise for which separate financial information is evaluated regularly by the chief operating decision maker, or decision making group, in deciding how to allocate resources and assessing performance. The Company has made several acquisitions to expand its business and offerings. For example in fiscal 2012, the Company acquired Radian6 Technologies Inc. (Radian6) to provide cloud based social media monitoring, measurement and engagement solutions. This and other acquisitions made over the past two years have allowed the Company to expand its offerings, presence and reach in various segments of the enterprise cloud computing market. While the Company has offerings in multiple enterprise cloud computing market segments, the Companys business operates in one operating segment because the Companys decision making group evaluates the Companys financial information and resources and assesses the performance of these resources on a consolidated basis. Since the Company operates in one operating segment, all required financial segment information can be found in the consolidated financial statements.  Foreign Currency Translation The functional currency of the Companys major foreign subsidiaries is generally the local currency. Adjustments resulting from translating foreign functional currency financial statements into U.S. dollars are recorded as part of a separate component of stockholders equity. Foreign currency transaction gains and losses are included in net income (loss) for the period. All assets and liabilities denominated in a foreign currency are translated into U.S. dollars at the exchange rate on the balance sheet date. Revenues and expenses are translated at the average exchange rate during the period. Equity transactions are translated using historical exchange rates. Concentrations of Credit Risk and Significant Customers The Companys financial instruments that are exposed to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities and trade accounts receivable. Although the Company deposits its cash with multiple financial institutions, its deposits, at times, may exceed federally insured limits. Collateral is not required for accounts receivable. The Company maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts receivable balances. The allowance is based upon historical loss patterns, the number of days that billings are past due and an evaluation of the potential risk of loss associated with delinquent accounts. One customer accounted for 6 percent of accounts receivable at January 31, 2012 and no single customer accounted for more than 5 percent of accounts receivable at January 31, 2011. No single customer accounted for 5 percent or more of total revenue during fiscal 2012, 2011, and 2010. As of January 31, 2012 and 2011, assets located outside the Americas were 13 percent and 16 percent of total assets, respectively. Revenues by geographical region are as follows (in thousands): ##TABLE_START   Fiscal Year Ended January 31,    2012   2011   2010  Revenues by geography:    Americas  $ 1,540,289   $ 1,135,019   $ 923,823  Europe   408,456    291,784    232,367  Asia Pacific   317,794    230,336    149,393         $ 2,266,539   $ 1,657,139   $ 1,305,583        ##TABLE_END Cash and Cash Equivalents The Company considers all highly liquid investments purchased with an original maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents. Cash and cash equivalents are stated at fair value. Marketable Securities Management determines the appropriate classification of marketable securities at the time of purchase and reevaluates such determination at each balance sheet date. Securities are classified as available for sale and are carried at fair value, with the unrealized gains and losses, net of tax, reported as a separate component of stockholders equity. Fair value is determined based on quoted market rates when observable or utilizing data points that are observable, such as quoted prices, interest rates and yield curves. Declines in fair value judged to be other-than-temporary on securities available for sale are included as a component of investment income. In order to determine whether a decline in value is other-than-temporary, the Company evaluates, among other factors: the duration and extent to which the fair value has been less than the carrying value and its intent and ability to retain the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in fair market value. The cost of securities sold is based on the specific-identification method. Interest on securities classified as available for sale is also included as a component of investment income.  Fair Value Measurement The Company reports its financial and non-financial assets and liabilities that are re-measured and reported at fair value at each reporting period. The Company uses a three-tier fair value hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used in the valuation methodologies in measuring fair value: ##TABLE_START Level 1.  Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. Level 2.  Include other inputs that are directly or indirectly observable in the marketplace. Level 3.  Unobservable inputs which are supported by little or no market activity. ##TABLE_END All of the Companys cash equivalents, marketable securities and foreign currency derivative contracts are classified within Level 1 or Level 2 because the Companys cash equivalents, marketable securities and foreign currency derivative contracts are valued using quoted market prices or alternative pricing sources and models utilizing market observable inputs. The Companys contingent considerations related to acquisitions are classified within Level 3 because the liabilities are valued using significant unobservable inputs. The following table presents information about the Companys assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value as of January 31, 2012 and indicates the fair value hierarchy of the valuation (in thousands): ##TABLE_START Description  Quoted Prices in Active Markets for Identical Assets (Level 1)   Significant Other Observable Inputs (Level 2)   Significant Unobservable Inputs (Level 3)   Balances as of January 31, 2012  Cash equivalents (1):     Time deposits  $ 26,513   $ 0   $ 0   $ 26,513  Money market mutual funds   358,369    0    0    358,369  Marketable securities:     Corporate notes and obligations   0    504,772    0    504,772  U.S. treasury securities   79,358    0    0    79,358  Mortgage backed securities   0    15,426    0    15,426  Government obligations   3,210    0    0    3,210  Municipal securities   0    8,789    0    8,789  Collateralized mortgage obligations   0    120,495    0    120,495  U.S. agency obligations   0    107,840    0    107,840  Foreign currency derivative contracts (2)   0    621    0    621          Total Assets  $ 467,450   $ 757,943   $ 0   $ 1,225,393          Liabilities     Foreign currency derivative contracts (3)  $ 0   $ 2,551   $ 0   $ 2,551  Contingent considerations (related to acquisitions, see Note 5) (3)   0    0    0    0          Total Liabilities  $ 0   $ 2,551   $ 0   $ 2,551          ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START (1) Included in cash and cash equivalents in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheet as of January 31, 2012, in addition to $222.4 million of cash. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START (2) Included in prepaid expenses and other current assets in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheet as of January 31, 2012. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START (3) Included in accrued expenses and other current liabilities in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheet as of January 31, 2012. ##TABLE_END  The following table presents the Companys liabilities that were measured at fair value using significant unobservable inputs (Level 3) during the fiscal year ended January 31, 2012.

These consisted of the Companys contingent consideration liabilities related to acquisitions and the fair value was determined using a discounted cash flow model (in thousands): ##TABLE_START Balance at February 1, 2010  $ 0  Additions and changes in fair value   17,138    Balance at January 31, 2011  $ 17,138    ##TABLE_END  Strategic Investments The Company has two investments in marketable equity securities measured using quoted prices in their respective active markets and certain interests in non-marketable equity and debt securities that are considered strategic investments. As of January 31, 2012, the fair value of the Companys marketable equity securities of $5.6 million includes an unrealized gain of $3.4 million. As of January 31, 2011, the fair value of the Companys marketable equity security of $6.0 million includes an unrealized gain of $5.2 million. These investments are recorded in other assets, net on the consolidated balance sheets. The Companys interest in non-marketable equity and debt securities consists of noncontrolling equity and debt investments in privately-held companies. The Companys investments in these privately-held companies are reported at cost or marked down to fair value when an event or circumstance indicates an other-than-temporary decline in value has occurred. These investments are valued using significant unobservable inputs or data in an inactive market and the valuation requires the Companys judgment due to the absence of market price and inherent lack of liquidity. As of January 31, 2012 and 2011 the carrying value that approximates the fair value of the Companys investments in privately-held companies was $48.3 million and $21.1 million, respectively. These investments are recorded in other assets, net on the consolidated balance sheets. Derivative Financial Instruments The Company enters into foreign currency derivative contracts with financial institutions to reduce the risk that its cash flows and earnings will be adversely affected by foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. The Company uses forward currency derivative contracts to minimize the Companys exposure of balances primarily denominated in Euros, Japanese yen and British pounds. The Companys foreign currency derivative contracts which are not designated as hedging instruments are used to reduce the exchange rate risk associated primarily with intercompany receivables and payables. The Companys program is not designated for trading or speculative purposes. As of January 31, 2012 and 2011 the foreign currency derivative contracts that were not settled are recorded at fair value on the consolidated balance sheets. Foreign currency derivative contracts are marked-to-market at the end of each reporting period with gains and losses recognized as other income (expense) to offset the gains or losses resulting from the settlement or remeasurement of the underlying foreign currency denominated receivables and payables. While the contract or notional amount is often used to express the volume of foreign currency derivative contracts, the amounts potentially subject to credit risk are generally limited to the amounts, if any, by which the counterparties obligations under the agreements exceed the obligations of the Company to the counterparties. Details on outstanding foreign currency derivative contracts related primarily to intercompany receivables and payables are presented below (in thousands): ##TABLE_START   January 31, 2012   January 31, 2011  Notional amount of foreign currency derivative contracts  $ 186,336   $ 202,491  Fair value of foreign currency derivative contracts  $ (1,930 )  $ (1,324 ) ##TABLE_END  The Companys fair value of its outstanding derivative instruments are summarized below (in thousands): ##TABLE_START     Fair Value of Derivative Instruments    Balance Sheet Location  As of January 31, 2012   As of January 31, 2011  Derivative Assets    Derivatives not designated as hedging instruments:    Foreign currency derivative contracts  Prepaid expenses and other current assets  $ 621   $ 1,539       Derivative Liabilities    Derivatives not designated as hedging instruments:    Foreign currency derivative contracts  Accrued expenses and other current liabilities  $ 2,551   $ 2,863       ##TABLE_END The effect of the derivative instruments not designated as hedging instruments on the consolidated statements of operations for the years ended January 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively are summarized below (in thousands): ##TABLE_START Derivatives Not Designated as Hedging Instruments  Gains (Losses) Recognized in Income on Derivative Instruments       Year ended January 31,    Location   2012   2011   2010  Foreign currency derivative contracts   Other expense   $ (1,930 )  $ (1,324 )  $ 1,191         ##TABLE_END Investment Income Investment income consists of interest income, realized gains, and realized losses on the Companys cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities. The components of investment income are presented below (in thousands): ##TABLE_START   Fiscal Year Ended January 31,    2012   2011   2010  Interest income  $ 20,791   $ 28,273   $ 21,219  Realized gains   6,542    12,460    13,391  Realized losses   (4,065 )   (2,998 )   (4,202 )       Total investment income  $ 23,268   $ 37,735   $ 30,408        ##TABLE_END Interest Expense Interest expense consists of interest on the Companys capital lease commitments and 0.75% convertible senior notes (the Notes), net of amounts capitalized. As described in Note 2, in accounting for the Notes at the time of issuance in January 2010, the carrying amount of the liability component was calculated by measuring the fair value of a similar liability that did not have an associated convertible feature. The excess of the principal amount of the liability component over its carrying amount (debt discount) is amortized, using an effective interest rate of 5.86%, to interest expense over the term of the Notes.  Property and Equipment Fixed assets are stated at cost. Depreciation is calculated on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of those assets as follows: ##TABLE_START Computers, equipment, and software  3 to 7 years Furniture and fixtures  5 years Leasehold improvements  Shorter of the estimated useful life or the lease term Buildings and improvements  Amortized over the estimated useful lives of the respective assets when they are ready for their intended use. ##TABLE_END When assets are retired, the cost and accumulated depreciation and amortization are removed from their respective accounts and any loss on such retirement is reflected in operating expenses. When assets are otherwise disposed of, the cost and related accumulated depreciation and amortization are removed from their respective accounts and any gain or loss on such sale or disposal is reflected in other income (expense). Capitalized Interest Cost Interest costs related to major capital projects, specifically the Companys campus project and capitalized internal-use software development costs, are capitalized until the underlying asset is placed into service. Capitalized interest is calculated by multiplying the effective interest rate of the Notes by the qualifying costs. As the qualifying asset is placed into service, the qualifying asset and the related capitalized interest are amortized over the useful life of the related asset. Interest costs of $14.1 million and $3.7 million related to the buildings and improvements and $0.5 million and $0.3 million related to the Companys capitalized internal-use software development efforts were capitalized in fiscal 2012 and 2011, respectively. Goodwill, Intangible Assets, Long-Lived Assets and Impairment Assessments Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price of an acquired business over the fair value of the underlying net tangible and intangible assets. In the event that the Company determines that the carrying value of goodwill is less than fair value, the Company will incur an impairment charge for the amount of the difference during the quarter in which the determination is made. The Company evaluates and tests the recoverability of the goodwill for impairment annually in the fourth quarter or more often if and when circumstances indicate that goodwill may not be recoverable. There was no impairment of goodwill during fiscal 2012, 2011 and 2010. Intangible assets are amortized over their useful lives. Each period the Company evaluates the estimated remaining useful life of its intangible assets and whether events or changes in circumstances warrant a revision to the remaining period of amortization. The carrying amounts of these assets are periodically reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of these assets may not be recoverable. Recoverability of these assets is measured by comparison of the carrying amount of each asset to the future undiscounted cash flows the asset is expected to generate. In the event that the Company determines certain assets are not fully recoverable, the Company will incur an impairment charge for those assets or portion thereof during the quarter in which the determination is made. There was no impairment of intangible assets during fiscal 2012, 2011 and 2010. The Company evaluates the recoverability of its long-lived assets for possible impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable. If such review indicates that the carrying amount of long-lived assets is not recoverable, the carrying amount of such assets is reduced to fair value. There was no impairment of long-lived assets during fiscal 2012, 2011 and 2010. Capitalized Software Costs The Company capitalizes costs related to its enterprise cloud computing services incurred during the application development stage. Costs related to preliminary project activities and post implementation activities  were expensed as incurred. Internal-use software is amortized on a straight line basis over its estimated useful life, generally three years. Management evaluates the useful lives of these assets on an annual basis and tests for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances occur that could impact the recoverability of these assets. The Company capitalized $27.6 million, $19.6 million, and $15.1 million of development costs during fiscal 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively. Amortization expense totaled $15.8 million, $13.1 million and $9.9 million during fiscal 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively. There was no impairment of capitalized software costs during fiscal 2012, 2011 and 2010. Earnings/Loss Per Share Basic earnings/loss per share attributable to salesforce.com is computed by dividing net income (loss) attributable to salesforce.com by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding for the fiscal period. Diluted earnings/loss per share attributable to salesforce.com is computed giving effect to all potential weighted average dilutive common stock, including options, restricted stock units, warrants and the convertible senior notes. The dilutive effect of outstanding awards and convertible securities is reflected in diluted earnings per share by application of the treasury stock method. Diluted earnings/loss per share for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2012 is the same as basic earnings/loss per share as there is a net loss in the period and inclusion of potentially issuable shares would be anti-dilutive. A reconciliation of the denominator used in the calculation of basic and diluted earnings/loss per share attributable to salesforce.com is as follows (in thousands): ##TABLE_START   Fiscal Year Ended January 31,    2012   2011   2010  Numerator:    Net income (loss) attributable to salesforce.com  $ (11,572 )  $ 64,474   $ 80,719        Denominator:    Weighted-average shares outstanding for basic earnings per share   135,302    130,222    124,462  Effect of dilutive securities:    Convertible senior notes   0    1,561    0  Employee stock awards   0    4,815    3,652        Adjusted weighted-average shares outstanding and assumed conversions for diluted earnings per share   135,302    136,598    128,114        ##TABLE_END The weighted-average number of shares outstanding used in the computation of basic and diluted earnings/loss per share does not include the effect of the following potential outstanding common stock. The effects of these potentially outstanding shares were not included in the calculation of diluted earnings/loss per share because the effect would have been anti-dilutive (in thousands): ##TABLE_START   Fiscal Year Ended January 31,    2012   2011   2010  Stock awards   7,560    1,061    4,455  Warrants   6,736    6,736    6,736  Convertible senior notes   6,735    0    0  ##TABLE_END Income Taxes The Company uses the liability method of accounting for income taxes. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on temporary differences between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities and net operating loss and credit carryforwards using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change  in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. Valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amounts more likely than not expected to be realized. Tax positions for the Company and its subsidiaries are subject to income tax audits by multiple tax jurisdictions throughout the world. The Company recognizes the tax benefit of an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the position is sustainable upon examination by the taxing authority, based on the technical merits. The tax benefit recognized is measured as the largest amount of benefit which is greater than 50 percent likely to be realized upon settlement with the taxing authority. The Company recognizes interest accrued and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in its tax provision. The total income tax benefit recognized in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations related to stock-based awards was $76.0 million, $44.1 million and $32.1 million for fiscal 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively. The Company recognizes interest accrued and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in its tax provision. As of January 31, 2012, the Company accrued no penalties and an immaterial amount of interest in income tax expense. Revenue Recognition The Company derives its revenues from two sources: (1) subscription revenues, which are comprised of subscription fees from customers accessing the Companys enterprise cloud computing services and from customers purchasing additional support beyond the standard support that is included in the basic subscription fees; and (2) related professional services such as process mapping, project management, implementation services and other revenue. Other revenue consists primarily of training fees. The Company commences revenue recognition when all of the following conditions are satisfied: ##TABLE_START    There is persuasive evidence of an arrangement; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    The service has been or is being provided to the customer; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    The collection of the fees is reasonably assured; and ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    The amount of fees to be paid by the customer is fixed or determinable. ##TABLE_END The Companys subscription service arrangements are non-cancelable and do not contain refund-type provisions. Subscription and Support Revenues Subscription and support revenues are recognized ratably over the contract terms beginning on the commencement date of each contract, which is the date the Companys service is made available to customers. Amounts that have been invoiced are recorded in accounts receivable and in deferred revenue or revenue, depending on whether the revenue recognition criteria have been met. Professional Services and Other Revenues The majority of the Companys professional services contracts are on a time and material basis. When these services are not combined with subscription revenues as a single unit of accounting, as discussed below, these revenues are recognized as the services are rendered for time and material contracts, and when the milestones are achieved and accepted by the customer for fixed price contracts. Training revenues are recognized as the services are performed.  Multiple-Deliverable Arrangements The Company enters into arrangements with multiple-deliverables that generally include subscription, premium support and professional services. Prior to February 1, 2011, the deliverables in multiple-deliverable arrangements were accounted for separately if the delivered items had standalone value and there was objective and reliable evidence of fair value for the undelivered items. If the deliverables in a multiple-deliverable arrangement could not be accounted for separately, the total arrangement fee was recognized ratably as a single unit of accounting over the contracted term of the subscription agreement. A significant portion of the Companys multiple-deliverable arrangements were accounted for as a single unit of accounting because the Company did not have objective and reliable evidence of fair value for certain of its deliverables. Additionally, in these situations, the Company deferred the direct costs of a related professional services arrangement and amortized those costs over the same period as the professional services revenue was recognized. In October 2009, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2009-13,  Revenue Recognition (Topic 605), Multiple-Deliverable Revenue Arrangementsa consensus of the FASB Emerging Issues Task Force  (ASU 2009-13) which amended the previous multiple-deliverable arrangements accounting guidance. Pursuant to the updated guidance, objective and reliable evidence of fair value of the deliverables to be delivered is no longer required in order to account for deliverables in a multiple-deliverable arrangement separately. Instead, arrangement consideration is allocated to deliverables based on their relative selling price. In the first quarter of fiscal 2012, the Company adopted this updated accounting guidance on a prospective basis. The Company applied the new accounting guidance to those multiple-deliverable arrangements entered into or materially modified on or after February 1, 2011, which is the beginning of the Companys fiscal year. The adoption of this updated accounting guidance did not have a material impact on the Companys financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. As of January 31, 2012, the deferred professional services revenue and deferred costs under the previous accounting guidance are $30.5 million and $14.3 million, respectively, which will continue to be recognized over the related remaining subscription period. Under the updated accounting guidance, in order to treat deliverables in a multiple-deliverable arrangement as separate units of accounting, the deliverables must have standalone value upon delivery. If the deliverables have standalone value upon delivery, the Company accounts for each deliverable separately. Subscription services have standalone value as such services are often sold separately. In determining whether professional services have standalone value, the Company considers the following factors for each professional services agreement: availability of the services from other vendors, the nature of the professional services, the timing of when the professional services contract was signed in comparison to the subscription service start date and the contractual dependence of the subscription service on the customers satisfaction with the professional services work. To date, the Company has concluded that all of the professional services included in multiple-deliverable arrangements executed have standalone value. Under the updated accounting guidance, when multiple-deliverables included in an arrangement are separated into different units of accounting, the arrangement consideration is allocated to the identified separate units based on a relative selling price hierarchy. The Company determines the relative selling price for a deliverable based on its vendor-specific objective evidence of selling price (VSOE), if available, or its best estimate of selling price (BESP), if VSOE is not available. The Company has determined that third-party evidence of selling price (TPE) is not a practical alternative due to differences in its service offerings compared to other parties and the availability of relevant third-party pricing information. The amount of revenue allocated to delivered items is limited by contingent revenue. For certain professional services, the Company has established VSOE as a consistent number of standalone sales of this deliverable have been priced within a reasonably narrow range. The Company has not established  VSOE for its subscription services due to lack of pricing consistency, the introduction of new services and other factors. Accordingly, the Company uses its BESP to determine the relative selling price. The Company determined BESP by considering its overall pricing objectives and market conditions. Significant pricing practices taken into consideration include the Companys discounting practices, the size and volume of the Companys transactions, the customer demographic, the geographic area where services are sold, price lists, its go-to-market strategy, historical standalone sales and contract prices. The determination of BESP is made through consultation with and approval by the Companys management, taking into consideration the go-to-market strategy. As the Companys go-to-market strategies evolve, the Company may modify its pricing practices in the future, which could result in changes in relative selling prices, including both VSOE and BESP. Deferred Revenue The deferred revenue balance does not represent the total contract value of annual or multi-year, non-cancelable subscription agreements. Deferred revenue primarily consists of billings or payments received in advance of revenue recognition from subscription services described above and is recognized as the revenue recognition criteria are met. The Company generally invoices customers in annual or quarterly installments. Deferred revenue is influenced by several factors, including seasonality, the compounding effects of renewals, invoice duration, invoice timing and new business linearity within the quarter. As a result of the updated accounting guidance previously described, billings against professional services arrangements entered into prior to February 1, 2011 were generally added to deferred revenue and recognized over the remaining related subscription contract term. Deferred revenue that will be recognized during the succeeding twelve month period is recorded as current deferred revenue and the remaining portion is recorded as noncurrent. Deferred Commissions Deferred commissions are the incremental costs that are directly associated with non-cancelable subscription contracts with customers and consist of sales commissions paid to the Companys direct sales force. The commissions are deferred and amortized over the non-cancelable terms of the related customer contracts, which are typically 12 to 24 months. The commission payments are paid in full the month after the customers service commences. The deferred commission amounts are recoverable through the future revenue streams under the non-cancelable customer contracts. The Company believes this is the preferable method of accounting as the commission charges are so closely related to the revenue from the non-cancelable customer contracts that they should be recorded as an asset and charged to expense over the same period that the subscription revenue is recognized. Amortization of deferred commissions is included in marketing and sales expense in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations. Business Combinations The Company uses its best estimates and assumptions to accurately assign fair value to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date, the Companys estimates are inherently uncertain and subject to refinement. As a result, during the measurement period, which may be up to one year from the acquisition date, the Company may record adjustments to the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed, with the corresponding offset to goodwill. Upon the conclusion of the measurement period or final determination of the fair value of assets acquired or liabilities assumed, whichever comes first, any subsequent adjustments are recorded to the Companys consolidated statements of operations. In addition, uncertain tax positions and tax related valuation allowances assumed in connection with a business combination are initially estimated as of the acquisition date. The Company continues to collect  information in order to determine their estimated fair values as of the date of acquisition. The Company reevaluates these items quarterly and records any adjustments to the Companys preliminary estimates to goodwill provided that the Company is within the measurement period. Subsequent to the measurement period, changes to these uncertain tax positions and tax related valuation allowances will affect the Companys provision for income taxes in the Companys consolidated statements of operations. Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation The Company recognizes stock-based expenses related to stock options on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period of the awards, which is the vesting term of four years. The Company recognizes stock-based expenses related to the Employee Stock Purchase Plan (ESPP) on a straight-line basis over the offering period, which is twelve months. Stock-based expenses are recognized net of estimated forfeiture activity. The fair value of each option grant and stock purchase right granted under the ESPP was estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model with the following assumptions and fair value per share: ##TABLE_START   Fiscal Year Ended January 31, Stock Options  2012  2011  2010 Volatility  47 - 51%  45 - 50%  50 - 60% Estimated life  3.7 years  3.7 - 3.8 years  3.8 - 4 years Weighted-average risk-free interest rate  0.68 - 1.77%  0.98 - 2.1%  1.78 - 2.39% Dividend yield  0  0  0 Weighted-average fair value per share of grants  $49.14  $48.83  $24.73   Fiscal Year Ended January 31, ESPP  2012  2011  2010 Volatility  50 - 53%  0  0 Estimated life  6 - 12 months  0  0 Weighted-average risk-free interest rate  0.95 - 1.08%  0  0 Dividend yield  0  0  0 Weighted-average fair value per share of grants  $34.34  $0.00  $0.00 ##TABLE_END The estimated life for the stock options was based on an actual analysis of expected life. The estimated life for the ESPP was based on the two purchase periods within the offering period. The risk free interest rate is based on the rate for a U.S. government security with the same estimated life at the time of the option grant and the stock purchase rights. The Company estimated its future stock price volatility considering both its observed option-implied volatilities and its historical volatility calculations. Management believes this is the best estimate of the expected volatility over the expected life of its stock options and stock purchase rights. During fiscal 2012 and 2011, the Company capitalized $2.4 million and $2.6 million, respectively, of stock based expenses related to capitalized internal-use software development and deferred professional services costs. During fiscal 2012, the Company recognized stock-based expense of $229.3 million. As of January 31, 2012, the aggregate stock compensation remaining to be amortized to costs and expenses was $820.6 million. The Company expects this stock compensation balance to be amortized as follows: $296.5 million during fiscal 2013; $256.4 million during fiscal 2014; $196.1 million during fiscal 2015 and $71.6 million during fiscal 2016. The expected amortization reflects only outstanding stock awards as of January 31, 2012 and assumes no forfeiture activity. The Company expects to continue to issue stock-based awards to its employees and continue its ESPP in future periods.  Warranties and Indemnification The Companys enterprise cloud computing services are typically warranted to perform in a manner consistent with general industry standards that are reasonably applicable and materially in accordance with the Companys online help documentation under normal use and circumstances. The Companys arrangements generally include certain provisions for indemnifying customers against liabilities if its products or services infringe a third-partys intellectual property rights. To date, the Company has not incurred any material costs as a result of such obligations and has not accrued any liabilities related to such obligations in the accompanying consolidated financial statements. The Company has also agreed to indemnify its directors and executive officers for costs associated with any fees, expenses, judgments, fines and settlement amounts incurred by any of these persons in any action or proceeding to which any of those persons is, or is threatened to be, made a party by reason of the persons service as a director or officer, including any action by the Company, arising out of that persons services as the Companys director or officer or that persons services provided to any other company or enterprise at the Companys request. The Company maintains director and officer insurance coverage that would generally enable the Company to recover a portion of any future amounts paid. The Company may also be subject to indemnification obligations by law with respect to the actions of its employees under certain circumstances and in certain jurisdictions. Advertising Expenses Advertising is expensed as incurred. Advertising expense was $80.3 million, $61.4 million and $50.8 million for fiscal 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively. Subsequent Events The Company evaluated subsequent events through the date this Annual Report on Form 10-K was filed with the SEC. New Accounting Pronouncements In December 2010, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2010-29, Disclosure of Supplementary Pro Forma Information for Business Combinations (Topic 805)  Business Combinations (ASU 2010-29), to improve consistency in how the pro forma disclosures are calculated. Additionally, ASU 2010-29 enhances the disclosure requirements and requires description of the nature and amount of any material, nonrecurring pro forma adjustments directly attributable to a business combination. ASU 2010-29 is effective for the Company in fiscal 2013 and should be applied prospectively to business combinations for which the acquisition date is after the effective date. The Company does not believe the impact of the pending adoption of ASU 2010-29 will have a significant effect on the consolidated financial statements. In June 2011, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2011-05, Comprehensive Income (Topic 220)Presentation of Comprehensive Income (ASU 2011-05), to require an entity to present the total of comprehensive income, the components of net income, and the components of other comprehensive income either in a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements. ASU 2011-05 eliminates the option to present the components of other comprehensive income as part of the statement of equity. ASU 2011-05 is effective for the Company in fiscal 2013 and should be applied retrospectively. The Company does not believe the impact of the pending adoption of ASU 2011-05 will have a significant effect on the consolidated financial statements.  2.

Interest is payable semi-annually in arrears on January 15 and July 15 of each year, commencing July 15, 2010. The Notes are governed by an Indenture dated as of January 19, 2010, between the Company, as issuer, and U.S. Bank National Association, as trustee. The Notes do not contain any financial covenants or any restrictions  on the payment of dividends, the incurrence of senior debt or other indebtedness, or the issuance or repurchase of securities by the Company. The Notes are unsecured and rank senior in right of payment to the Companys future indebtedness that is expressly subordinated in right of payment to the Notes and rank equal in right of payment to the Companys existing and future unsecured indebtedness that is not so subordinated and are effectively subordinated in right of payment to any of the Companys cash equal to the principal amount of the Notes, and secured indebtedness to the extent of the value of the assets securing such indebtedness and are structurally subordinated to all existing and future indebtedness and liabilities incurred by our subsidiaries, including trade payables. If converted, holders will receive cash equal to the principal amount of the Notes, and at the Companys election, cash and/or shares of the Companys common stock for any amounts in excess of the principal amounts. The initial conversion rate is 11.7147 shares of common stock per $1,000 principal amount of Notes, subject to anti-dilution adjustments. The initial conversion price is $85.36 per share of common stock. Throughout the term of the Notes, the conversion rate may be adjusted upon the occurrence of certain events, including for any cash dividends. Holders of the Notes will not receive any cash payment representing accrued and unpaid interest upon conversion of a Note. Accrued but unpaid interest will be deemed to be paid in full upon conversion rather than cancelled, extinguished or forfeited. Holders may convert their Notes under the following circumstances: ##TABLE_START    during any fiscal quarter, if, for at least 20 trading days during the 30 consecutive trading day period ending on the last trading day of the immediately preceding fiscal quarter, the last reported sales price of the Companys common stock for such trading day is greater than or equal to 130% of the applicable conversion price on such trading day share of common stock on such last trading day; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    in certain situations, when the trading price of the Notes is less than 98% of the product of the sale price of the Companys common stock and the conversion rate; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    upon the occurrence of specified corporate transactions described under the Notes Indenture, such as a consolidation, merger or binding share exchange; or ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    at any time on or after October 15, 2014. ##TABLE_END For 20 trading days during the 30 consecutive trading days ended October 31, 2011, the Companys common stock traded at a price exceeding 130% of the conversion price of $85.36 per share applicable to the Notes. Therefore the Notes were convertible at the option of the holder up to 6.7 million of the Companys common shares as of January 31, 2012 and the Notes were classified as a current liability on the Companys consolidated balance sheet. Additionally, a portion of the equity component of the Notes attributable to the conversion feature of the Notes is classified in temporary stockholders equity equal to the difference between the principal amount and carrying value of the Notes. For 20 trading days during the 30 consecutive trading days ended January 31, 2012, the Companys common stock did not exceed 130% of the conversion price of $85.36 per share applicable to the Notes. Accordingly, the Notes will not be convertible at the holders option for the quarter ending April 30, 2012 and will be reclassified as a noncurrent liability on the Companys consolidated balance sheet so long as the Notes are not convertible. Holders of the Notes have the right to require the Company to purchase with cash all or a portion of the Notes upon the occurrence of a fundamental change, such as a change of control at a purchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Notes plus accrued and unpaid interest. Following certain corporate transactions that constitute a change of control, the Company will increase the conversion rate for a holder who elects to convert the Notes in connection with such change of control in certain circumstances. In accounting for the issuance of the Notes, the Company separated the Notes into liability and equity components. The carrying amount of the liability component was calculated by measuring the fair value of a  similar liability that does not have an associated convertible feature. The carrying amount of the equity component representing the conversion option was determined by deducting the fair value of the liability component from the par value of the Notes as a whole. The excess of the principal amount of the liability component over its carrying amount (debt discount) is amortized to interest expense over the term of the Note. The equity component is not remeasured as long as it continues to meet the conditions for equity classification. In accounting for the transaction costs related to the Note issuance, the Company allocated the total amount incurred to the liability and equity components based on their relative values. Transaction costs attributable to the liability component are being amortized to expense over the term of the Notes, and transaction costs attributable to the equity component were netted with the equity component in temporary stockholders equity and stockholders equity. Additionally, the Company recorded a deferred tax liability of $51.1 million in connection with the Notes. The Notes consisted of the following (in thousands): ##TABLE_START   As of January 31,    2012   2011  Liability component:   Principal  $ 574,890   $ 575,000  Less: debt discount, net (1)   (78,741 )   (102,462 )     Net carrying amount  $ 496,149   $ 472,538      ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START (1) Included in the consolidated balance sheets within 0.75% convertible senior notes and is amortized over the remaining life of the Notes using the effective interest rate method. ##TABLE_END As of January 31, 2012, the remaining life of the Notes is approximately 3 years. The following table sets forth total interest expense recognized related to the Notes prior to capitalization of interest (in thousands): ##TABLE_START   Fiscal Year Ended January 31,    2012   2011  Contractual interest expense  $ 4,312   $ 4,313  Amortization of debt issuance costs   1,324    1,324  Amortization of debt discount   23,720    22,396       $ 29,356   $ 28,033      Effective interest rate of the liability component   5.86 %   5.86 % ##TABLE_END Note Hedges To minimize the impact of potential economic dilution upon conversion of the Notes, the Company entered into convertible note hedge transactions with respect to its common stock (the Note Hedges). The Company paid, in January 2010, an aggregate amount of $126.5 million for the Note Hedges. The Note Hedges cover, approximately 6.7 million shares of the Companys common stock at a strike price that corresponds to the initial conversion price of the Notes, also subject to adjustment, and are exercisable upon conversion of the Notes. The Note Hedges will expire upon the maturity of the Notes. The Note Hedges are intended to reduce the potential economic dilution upon conversion of the Notes in the event that the market value per share of the Companys common stock, as measured under the Notes, at the time of exercise is greater than the conversion price of the Notes. The Note Hedges are separate transactions and are not part of the terms of the Notes. Holders of the Notes will not have any rights with respect to the Note Hedges. The Company initially recorded a deferred tax asset of $51.4 million in connection with these Note Hedges.  Warrants Separately, the Company in January 2010 also entered into warrant transactions (the Warrants), whereby the Company sold warrants to acquire, subject to anti-dilution adjustments, up to 6.7 million shares of the Companys common stock at a strike price of $119.51 per share. The Company received aggregate proceeds of $59.3 million from the sale of the Warrants. As the average market value per share of the Companys common stock for the reporting period, as measured under the Warrants, exceeds the strike price of the Warrants, the Warrants would have a dilutive effect on the Companys earnings/loss per share. The Warrants were anti-dilutive for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2012. The Warrants are separate transactions, entered into by the Company and are not part of the terms of the Notes or Note Hedges. Holders of the Notes and Note Hedges will not have any rights with respect to the Warrants. 3. Stockholders Equity The Company maintains the following stock plans: the 2004 Equity Incentive Plan, 2004 Employee Stock Purchase Plan and the 2004 Outside Directors Stock Plan. These plans, other than the 2004 Outside Directors Stock Plan, provide for annual automatic increases on February 1 to the shares reserved for issuance. The expiration of the 1999 Stock Option Plan (1999 Plan) in fiscal 2010 did not affect awards outstanding, which continue to be governed by the terms and conditions of the 1999 Plan. On February 1, 2012, 3.5 million additional shares were reserved under the 2004 Equity Incentive Plan pursuant to the automatic increase. In September 2011, the Companys Board of Directors amended and restated the 2004 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the ESPP). Initially, the ESPP was established in 2004, but the Companys Board of Directors authorization was required for the commencement of one or more offerings. In conjunction with the amendment of the ESPP, the Companys Board of Directors determined that the offerings under the ESPP would commence, beginning with a twelve month offering period starting in December 2011. Under the Companys ESPP, employees are granted the right to purchase shares of common stock at a price per share that is 85% of the lesser of the fair market value of the shares at (1) the beginning of a rolling one-year offering period or (2) the end of each semi-annual purchase period, subject to a plan limit on the number of shares that may be purchased in a purchase period. As of January 31, 2012, the Company has 1,000,000 shares of its common stock reserved for future issuance under this plan. As of January 31, 2012, $10.1 million has been held on behalf of employees for future purchases under the plan and is recorded in accrued expenses and other current liabilities. This amount is also included in proceeds from equity plans in the financing activities section of the consolidated statements of cash flows. In April 2006, the Companys Board of Directors approved the 2006 Inducement Equity Incentive Plan (the Inducement Plan) that allows for stock option and other equity incentive grants to employees in connection with merger or acquisition activity. In September 2011, the Companys Board of Directors amended the Inducement Plan to increase the share reserve by 400,000 shares. Prior to February 1, 2006, options issued under the Companys stock option plans generally had a term of 10 years. After February 1, 2006, options issued have a term of 5 years.

The intrinsic value is the difference of the current market value of the stock and the exercise price of the stock option. The weighted-average remaining contractual life of vested and expected to vest options is approximately 3 years.

Significant components of the Companys deferred tax assets and liabilities were as follows (in thousands): ##TABLE_START   As of January 31,    2012   2011  Deferred tax assets:   Net operating loss carryforwards  $ 35,942   $ 21,929  Deferred stock compensation   61,029    31,872  Tax credits   54,243    39,065  Deferred rent expense   11,661    8,371  Accrued liabilities   49,825    29,549  Deferred revenue   5,936    9,727  Other   6,792    4,508      Total deferred tax assets   225,428    145,021  Less valuation allowance   (835 )   (1,142 )     Deferred tax assets, net of valuation allowance   224,593    143,879  Deferred tax liabilities:   Deferred commissions   (49,029 )   (27,739 ) Purchased intangibles   (18,052 )   (24,856 ) Unrealized gains on investments   (2,881 )   (5,005 ) Depreciation and amortization   (26,352 )   (13,500 ) Other   (8,871 )   (4,064 )     Total deferred tax liabilities   (105,185 )   (75,164 )     Net deferred tax assets  $ 119,408   $ 68,715      ##TABLE_END Realization of deferred tax assets is dependent on future earnings, if any, the timing and amount of which are uncertain. Accordingly, the deferred tax assets have been partially offset by a valuation allowance. The valuation allowance relates to net deferred tax assets from operating losses of certain foreign subsidiaries. The excess tax benefits associated with stock option exercises are recorded directly to stockholders equity controlling interest only when realized. As a result, the excess tax benefits included in net operating loss carryforwards but not reflected in deferred tax assets for fiscal year 2012 and 2011 are $149.1 million and $80.6 million, respectively. At January 31, 2012, the Company had net operating loss carryforwards for federal income tax purposes of approximately $487.9 million, which expire in 2024 through 2032, federal research and development tax credits of approximately $36.6 million, which expire in 2020 through 2032, foreign tax credits of $3.9 million, which expires in 2019, and minimum tax credits of $0.7 million, which have no expiration date. The Company also had net operating loss carryforwards for state income tax purposes of approximately $319.0 million which expire beginning in 2014 and state research and development tax credits of approximately $33.8 million and $6.5 million of state enterprise zone tax credits, which do not expire. The decrease in the Companys state effective tax rate resulting from Californias tax law change could potentially impact the realizability of certain tax attributes. The Company will continue to re-assess the realizability of these tax attributes on a regular basis. Utilization of the Companys net operating loss carryforwards may be subject to substantial annual limitation due to the ownership change limitations provided by the Internal Revenue Code and similar state provisions. Such an annual limitation could result in the expiration of the net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards before utilization.  The Company had gross unrecognized tax benefits of $52.0 million and $27.5 million as of January 31, 2012 and 2011 respectively. A reconciliation of the beginning and ending balance of total unrecognized tax benefits for fiscal years 2012, 2011, and 2010 is as follows (in thousands): ##TABLE_START   Fiscal Year Ended January 31,    2012   2011   2010  Balance as of February 1,  $ 27,462   $ 22,053   $ 16,472  Tax positions taken in prior period:    Gross increases   10,008    41    457  Gross decreases   (23 )   (811 )   (707 ) Tax positions taken in current period:    Gross increases   15,965    8,047    5,401  Settlements   0    (39 )   (212 ) Lapse of statute of limitations   (1,143 )   (1,741 )   0  Currency translation effect   (298 )   (88 )   642        Balance as of January 31,  $ 51,971   $ 27,462   $ 22,053        ##TABLE_END For fiscal year 2012, 2011 and 2010 total unrecognized tax benefits in an amount of $39.1 million, $20.4 million and $16.5 million respectively, if recognized, would reduce income tax expense and the Companys effective tax rate. The Company recognizes interest accrued and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in the income tax provision. The Company accrued no penalties and an immaterial amount of interest in income tax expense for fiscal 2012, 2011 and 2010. Tax positions for the Company and its subsidiaries are subject to income tax audits by many tax jurisdictions throughout the world. The Companys U.S. federal and state tax returns for all tax years since February 1999, which was the inception of the Company, remain open to examination. Outside the U.S., the Company operates in jurisdictions including Canada, Australia, Japan and United Kingdom. With some exceptions, all tax years in jurisdictions outside of U.S. are generally open and could be subject to examinations, however, in Japan and United Kingdom, the Company is no longer subject to examinations for years prior to fiscal 2005 and 2010, respectively. Management does not believe that it is reasonably possible that the estimates of unrecognized tax benefits will change significantly in the next twelve months. However, when the Company effectively settles one or more uncertain tax positions in any period, it could be material to the Companys financial condition or cash flows, or both, or could otherwise adversely affect the Companys operating results. 7. Commitments Letters of Credit As of January 31, 2012, the Company had a total of $17.5 million in letters of credit outstanding substantially in favor of certain landlords for office space. These letters of credit renew annually and mature at various dates through April 2030. Leases The Company leases facilities space and certain fixed assets under non-cancelable operating and capital leases with various expiration dates.  As of January 31, 2012, the future minimum lease payments under non-cancelable operating and capital leases are as follows (in thousands): ##TABLE_START   Capital Leases   Operating Leases  Fiscal Period:   Fiscal 2013  $ 29,460   $ 124,247  Fiscal 2014   25,951    103,753  Fiscal 2015   5,406    71,787  Fiscal 2016   2,112    63,327  Fiscal 2017   1,310    54,391  Thereafter   0    250,315      Total minimum lease payments   64,239   $ 667,820     Less: amount representing interest   (3,242 )     Present value of capital lease obligations  $ 60,997      ##TABLE_END The terms of the lease agreements provide for rental payments on a graduated basis. The Company recognizes rent expense on a straight-line basis over the lease period and has accrued for rent expense incurred but not paid. Of the total operating lease commitment balance of $667.8 million, $607.7 million is related to facilities space. The remaining $60.1 million commitment is related to computer equipment and other leases. The Companys agreements for the facilities and certain services provide the Company with the option to renew. The Companys future contractual obligations would change if the Company exercised these options. Rent expense for fiscal 2012, 2011 and 2010 was $70.3 million, $52.8 million and $47.3 million, respectively. In January 2012, the Company entered into an office lease agreement to lease approximately 400,000 rentable square feet at 50 Fremont Street, San Francisco, CA. The cost of the lease is approximately $209.0 million over the 18-year term of the lease. The Company will take possession of the premises in phases beginning April 1, 2012. This commitment is reflected in the table above. 8. Legal Proceedings In the ordinary course of business, the Company is involved in various legal proceedings and claims related to alleged infringement of third-party patents and other intellectual property rights, commercial, employment, wage and hour, and other claims. In general, the resolution of a legal matter could prevent the Company from offering its service to others, could be material to the Companys financial condition or cash flows, or both, or could otherwise adversely affect the Companys operating results. The Company makes a provision for a liability relating to legal matters when it is both probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. These provisions are reviewed at least quarterly and adjusted to reflect the impacts of negotiations, estimated settlements, legal rulings, advice of legal counsel and other information and events pertaining to a particular matter. In managements opinion, resolution of all current matters is not expected to have a material adverse impact on the Companys consolidated results of operations, cash flows or financial position. However, depending on the nature and timing of any such dispute, an unfavorable resolution of a matter could materially affect the Companys future results of operations or cash flows, or both, of a particular quarter. On June 7, 2011, the Company entered into a preliminary settlement agreement with respect to a California state wage and hour lawsuit that had been filed against the Company early in 2011 in the Superior Court of  California, County of San Francisco. The settlement agreement is subject to approval of the court, which is expected to rule by mid 2012. The Companys current estimate of the expense charge for the settlement is approximately $0.04 per diluted share. This charge is reflected in the Companys financial results for fiscal 2012. 9. Employee Benefit Plan The Company has a 401(k) plan covering all eligible employees in the United States. Since January 1, 2006, the Company has been contributing to the plan. Total Company contributions during fiscal 2012, 2011 and 2010, were $15.7 million, $11.0 million and $8.5 million, respectively. 10. Related-Party Transactions In January 1999, the salesforce.com/foundation, also referred to as the Foundation, a non-profit public charity, was chartered to build philanthropic programs that are focused on youth and technology. The Companys chairman is the chairman of the Foundation. He, one of the Companys employees and one of the Companys board members hold three of the Foundations seven board seats. The Company is not the primary beneficiary of the Foundations activities, and accordingly, the Company does not consolidate the Foundations statement of activities with its financial results. Since the Foundations inception, the Company has provided at no charge certain resources to Foundation employees such as office space. The value of these items was in excess of $125,000 per quarter during fiscal year 2012. In addition to the resource sharing with the Foundation, the Company issued the Foundation warrants in August 2002 to purchase shares of the Companys common stock. All of the warrants were exercised in prior years. As of January 31, 2012, the Foundation held 103,500 shares of salesforce.com common stock. Additionally, the Company has donated subscriptions to the Companys service to other qualified non-profit organizations. The Company also allows an affiliate of the Foundation to resell the Companys service to large non-profit organizations. The Company does not charge the affiliate for the subscriptions. The fair value of the subscriptions were in excess of $7.0 million per quarter during fiscal 2012. The Company plans to continue these programs. 11. Selected Quarterly Financial Data (Unaudited) Selected summarized quarterly financial information for fiscal 2012 and 2011 is as follows: ##TABLE_START   1st Quarter   2nd Quarter   3rd Quarter   4th Quarter   Fiscal Year   (in thousands, except per share data)  Fiscal 2012      Revenues  $ 504,364   $ 546,002   $ 584,260   $ 631,913   $ 2,266,539  Gross profit   401,298    425,092    455,695    495,568    1,777,653  Loss from operations   (2,803 )   (15,748 )   (10,157 )   (6,377 )   (35,085 ) Net income (loss)   530    (4,268 )   (3,756 )   (4,078 )   (11,572 ) Basic net income (loss) per share  $ 0.00   $ (0.03 )  $ (0.03 )  $ (0.03 )  $ (0.09 ) Diluted net income (loss) per share  $ 0.00   $ (0.03 )  $ (0.03 )  $ (0.03 )  $ (0.09 ) Fiscal 2011      Revenues  $ 376,813   $ 394,372   $ 429,087   $ 456,867   $ 1,657,139  Gross profit   305,232    316,582    346,956    364,556    1,333,326  Income (loss) from operations   33,050    29,682    35,156    (391 )   97,497  Net income attributable to salesforce.com   17,745    14,744    21,072    10,913    64,474  Basic net income per share attributable to salesforce.com common shareholders  $ 0.14   $ 0.11   $ 0.16   $ 0.08   $ 0.50  Diluted net income per share attributable to salesforce.com common shareholders  $ 0.13   $ 0.11   $ 0.15   $ 0.08   $ 0.47  ##TABLE_END  ##TABLE_START ", "9A": " ITEM 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES ##TABLE_END (a) Evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act), as of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K. In designing and evaluating our disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any disclosure controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. In addition, the design of disclosure controls and procedures must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and that management is required to apply its judgment in evaluating the benefits of possible controls and procedures relative to their costs. Based on managements evaluation, our chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are designed to, and are effective to, provide assurance at a reasonable level that the information we are required to disclose in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in Securities and Exchange Commission rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. (b) Managements Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f). Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of January 31, 2012 based on the guidelines established in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). Our internal control over financial reporting includes policies and procedures that provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external reporting purposes in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Based on the results of our evaluation, our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of January 31, 2012. We reviewed the results of managements assessment with our Audit Committee. The effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of January 31, 2012 has been audited by Ernst  Young LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in its report which is included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. (c) Changes in internal control over financial reporting There was no change in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended January 31, 2012 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.  (d) Inherent Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls Our management, including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, do not expect that our disclosure controls or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the Company have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty, and that breakdowns can occur because of a simple error or mistake. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people or by management override of the controls. The design of any system of controls also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions; over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or the degree of compliance with policies or procedures may deteriorate. Because of the inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected. ##TABLE_START ", "9B": " ITEM 9B.

BUSINESS ##TABLE_END Overview We are a provider of enterprise cloud computing solutions. We were founded on the simple concept of delivering customer relationship management, or CRM, applications via the Internet, or cloud. We introduced our first CRM solution in February 2000 and we have expanded our offerings with new editions, solutions and enhanced features, through internal development and acquisitions. Our mission is to help our customers transform themselves into customer companies by empowering them to connect with their own customers, partners, employees and products in entirely new ways. With our four core servicesSales Cloud, Service Cloud, Marketing Cloud and the Salesforce Platformcustomers have the tools they need to build a next generation social front office with our social and mobile cloud technologies. Our products are intuitive and easy-to-use, can be deployed rapidly, customized easily and integrated with other platforms and enterprise applications, or apps. We deliver our solutions as a service via all the major Internet browsers and on most major mobile device operating systems. We sell to businesses of all sizes and in almost every industry worldwide on a subscription basis, primarily through our direct sales efforts and also indirectly through partners. Through our platform and other developer tools, we also encourage third parties to develop additional functionality and new apps that run on our platform, which are sold separately from, or in conjunction with, our service.  We were incorporated in Delaware in February 1999. Our principal executive offices are located in San Francisco, California and our principal website address is www.salesforce.com. Our office address is The Landmark @ One Market, Suite 300, San Francisco, California 94105. The Cloud, Social and Mobile Revolution We believe that the convergence of cloud, social and mobile technologies is fundamentally transforming how companies connect with their customers, employees, partners and products. Cloud computing has changed the way enterprise business apps are developed and deployed. Organizations no longer need to buy and maintain their own infrastructure of servers, storage and development tools in order to create and run business apps. Instead, companies can gain access to a variety of business apps via an Internet browser or mobile device on an as-needed basis, without the cost and complexity of managing the hardware or software in-house. The broad shift to social networking and the use of location aware, touch-based mobile devices in our personal lives have introduced new ways to communicate and collaborate. People now expect to have social and mobile experiences in their professional lives  they want to communicate through feeds and status updates from their phone or tablet, rather than being tethered to a desktop by their business applications. With customers, partners and employees connected and empowered, we believe companies must transform the way they sell, service, market and innovate. Our Cloud Solutions We provide enterprise cloud computing solutions. We offer social and mobile cloud apps and platform services, as well as professional services to facilitate the adoption of our solutions. We provide solutions in each of our four core markets: sales, customer service, marketing and cloud platforms. Our primary service offerings are as follows: Sales Cloud. The Sales Cloud enables companies to grow their sales pipelines, close more deals, improve sales productivity and gain valuable business insights. Our customers use the Sales Cloud to access accurate customer and prospect information, track leads and progress, forecast opportunities and collaborate around closing a sale on any device. The Sales Cloud also encompasses partner relationship management functionality (including channel management and partner portals) and real-time customer and contact information. Service Cloud. The Service Cloud enables companies to connect with their customers and effectively address their service and support needs. Our customers use the Service Cloud to connect their customer service agents with customers across every channel: phone, email, chat, self-service web portals, social networks and online communities. In addition, built-in collaboration tools enable customer service teams to share information on how to better service customers. Marketing Cloud. Our customers use the Marketing Cloud to listen to conversations taking place on public social networks like Facebook, Twitter and blogs. They can also publish content to engage with customers across these social networks, as well as to their own websites. The Marketing Cloud provides sophisticated analytics that enable companies to better identify sales leads and customer service issues, discover advocates, rapidly identify brand, product, or support issues and analyze content across social networks. Relevant conversations can be routed into the Sales Cloud and Service Cloud in the form of leads, contacts and customer service cases to give companies a complete view of their customers. The Salesforce Platform. The Salesforce Platform provides the infrastructure and many of the services that application developers need to build and deliver business apps. The Salesforce Platform is delivered as a service, enabling IT departments and independent software vendors (ISVs) to be more efficient, dedicating their time to building apps, rather than managing hardware and software. With the Salesforce Platform, developers have the freedom to develop apps in many of todays most popular programming languages, including Java and Ruby. The Salesforce Platform makes any app social and mobile, providing  social networking features, such as profiles, status updates and feeds; as well as the ability to extend apps to mobile devices. Professional Services We offer consulting, deployment and training services to our customers to facilitate the adoption of our social and mobile cloud solutions. Most of our consulting and deployment engagements are billed on a time and materials basis. We offer a number of traditional classroom and online educational classes that address topics such as deploying, using, administering and developing on our service. We also offer classes for our partners who deploy our service on behalf of our customers. We bill the traditional classroom and some of the online educational classes on a per person, per class basis. There is a selection of online educational classes available at no charge to customers that subscribe to our service. Business Benefits of Using Our Solution The key advantages of our solution include: Secure, private, scalable and reliable . Our service has been designed to provide our customers with privacy and high levels of performance, reliability and security. We have built, and continue to invest in, a comprehensive security infrastructure, including firewalls, intrusion detection systems, and encryption for transmissions over the Internet, which we monitor and test on a regular basis. We built and maintain a multi-tenant application architecture that has been designed to enable our service to scale securely, reliably and cost-effectively. Our multi-tenant application architecture maintains the integrity and separation of customer data while still permitting all customers to use the same application functionality simultaneously. Rapid deployment. Our service can be deployed rapidly since our customers do not have to spend time procuring, installing or maintaining the servers, storage, networking equipment, security products, or other infrastructure hardware and software necessary. Ease of integration. IT professionals are able to integrate our solutions with existing applications quickly and seamlessly. We provide a set of application programming interfaces (APIs) that enable customers and independent software developers to both integrate our solution with existing third-party, custom, and legacy apps and write their own application services that integrate with our solutions. For example, many of our customers use our Force.com API to move customer-related data from custom-developed and packaged applications into our service on a periodic basis to provide greater visibility into their activities. High levels of user adoption. We have designed our solutions to be intuitive and easy to use. Our solutions contain many tools and features recognizable to users of popular consumer web services, so users are more familiar with our user interface than typical enterprise applications. As a result, our users can often use and gain benefit from our solutions with minimal training. Rapid development of apps using the Salesforce Platform. Our customers and third-party developers can develop apps rapidly because of the ease of use and the benefits of a multi-tenant platform. We provide the capability for business users to easily customize our applications to suit their specific needs, and also a variety of programming language support so developers can code complex apps spanning multiple business processes and deliver them to multiple mobile devices. Increased innovation. By providing infrastructure and development environments on demand, we provide developers the opportunity to create new and innovative apps without having to invest in hardware and distribution. A developer with an idea for a new app can log onto our platforms, develop, test and support their system on the Salesforce Platform and make the app accessible for a subscription fee to his or her customers. Lower total cost of ownership. We enable customers to achieve significant up-front savings relative to the traditional enterprise software model. Customers benefit from the predictability of their future costs since they generally pay for the service on a per subscriber basis for the term of the subscription contract.  Because we deploy all upgrades on our servers, new features and functionality automatically become part of our service on the upgrade release date and therefore benefit all of our customers immediately. Our Strategy Our objective is to deliver solutions that help companies transform the way they sell, service, market and innovate. Not only do we provide enterprise cloud apps, we also provide an enterprise cloud computing platform upon which our customers and partners can build apps. Key elements of our strategy include: Strengthening our market-leading core solutions. We designed our solutions to easily accommodate new features and functions. We intend to continue to extend our core solutions with new features and functions. We also offer advanced editions for an additional subscription fee to customers that require enhanced CRM capabilities. Through our own development, acquisitions and partnerships, we have strengthened and extended our Sales Cloud and Service Cloud application offerings. We expect to continue to make such investments in the future. Innovating in high-growth markets. As part of our growth strategy, we are delivering innovative solutions in new categories, including marketing, collaboration and human capital management. We are expanding our footprint in these areas to offer new social and mobile cloud innovations to our customers. Improve renewal rates. Our goal is to have all of our customers renew their subscriptions at the end of their contractual terms. We run customer success and other related programs in an effort to secure renewals of existing customers. Deepening relationships with existing customers. We see a significant opportunity to deepen our relationships with our existing customers. As our customers realize the benefits of our service, we aim to either upgrade the customer to higher priced editions or sell more subscriptions by targeting additional functional areas and business units within the customer organization, and ultimately pursue enterprise-wide deployments. Pursuing new customers aggressively. We believe that our offerings provide significant value for businesses of any size. As a result, we will continue to aggressively target businesses of all sizes, primarily through our direct sales force. We have steadily increased and plan to continue to increase the number of direct sales professionals we employ, and we intend to develop additional distribution channels for our service. Building our business in top markets globally. We also believe that there is a substantial market opportunity for our service globally. We plan to continue to aggressively market to customers worldwide by recruiting local sales and support professionals and by building partnerships that help us add customers in the largest enterprise software markets around the world. Encouraging the development of third-party apps on our cloud computing platforms. The Salesforce Platform enables existing customers, ISVs and third-party developers to create and deliver cloud apps they have built on our multi-tenant platform. It is a platform on which apps can be created, tested, published, and run. In addition, these apps can be marketed and sold on the AppExchange, our online marketplace for business apps, or sold directly by software vendors. We believe our ecosystem of cloud developers and software vendors will address the business requirements of both current and potential customers. Technology, Development and Operations We deliver our service as a highly scalable, multi-tenant app. We use commercially available hardware and a combination of proprietary and commercially available software to provide our service. We have optimized our service to run on specific databases and operating systems using the tools and platforms best suited to serve our customers rather than providing software that must be written to different hardware, operating system and  database platforms, or that depends upon a customers unique systems environment. As part of our business strategy, we periodically acquire companies or technologies, and we incorporate the acquired technologies into our service while maintaining the quality and security standards that are consistent with our brand and reputation. Performance, functional depth and the usability of our service drive our technology decisions and product direction. Our service treats all customers as logically separate tenants in central applications, databases and other resources. As a result, we are able to spread the cost of delivering our service across our user base. In addition, because we do not have to manage thousands of distinct applications with their own business logic and database schemas, we believe that we can scale our business faster than traditional software vendors. Moreover, we can focus our resources on building new functionality to deliver to our customer base as a whole rather than on maintaining an infrastructure to support each of their distinct applications. Because of our multi-tenant and logically separated architecture, we are able to provide all of our customers with a solution based on a single version of our apps. Our research and development efforts are focused on improving and enhancing the features, functionality and security of our existing service offerings as well as developing new services. In addition, from time to time we supplement our internal research and development activities with outside development resources and acquired technology. Our customers access our service over the Internet via all of the major Internet browsers and on most major mobile device operating systems. We provide our services to our customers from third-party data center hosting facilities located in the United States and other countries. Customers We sell to businesses of all sizes. The number of paying subscriptions at each of our customers ranges from one to hundreds of thousands. None of our customers accounted for more than five percent of our revenues in fiscal 2013, 2012, or 2011. Sources of Revenue We derive our revenues primarily from subscription fees for our service. We also derive revenues from premier support, which provides customers with additional support beyond the standard support that is included in the basic subscription fee. We recognize subscription and support revenue ratably over the contract term, beginning on the commencement date of each contract. The majority of our professional services contracts are on a time and materials basis, for which we generally recognize revenue as the services are rendered. Amounts that have been invoiced are recorded in accounts receivable and in deferred revenue or revenue, depending on whether the revenue recognition criteria have been met. Deferred revenue primarily consists of billings or payments received in advance of revenue recognition from subscription services described above and is recognized as the revenue recognition criteria are met. Unbilled deferred revenue represents future billings under our subscription agreements that have not been invoiced and, accordingly, are not recorded in deferred revenue. We generally invoice customers in annual or quarterly installments. Deferred revenue and unbilled deferred revenue are influenced by several factors, including new business seasonality within the year, the specific timing and duration of large customer subscription agreements, the timing and compounding effects of customer renewals, varying billing cycles of subscription agreements, invoice timing, foreign currency fluctuations and new business linearity within the quarter.  Sales, Marketing and Customer Support We organize our sales and marketing programs by geographic regions, including the Americas, Europe, and Asia Pacific, which includes Japan. The majority of our revenue from the Americas is attributable to customers in the United States. Approximately 30 percent of our revenue comes from customers outside of the Americas. Direct Sales We sell our services primarily through our direct sales force, which is comprised of telephone sales personnel based in regional hubs, and field sales personnel based in territories close to their customers. Both our telephone sales and field sales personnel are supported by sales representatives, who are primarily responsible for generating qualified sales leads. Our small business, commercial and enterprise account executives focus their efforts on small, mid-size and large enterprises, respectively. Referral and Indirect Sales We have a network of partners who refer sales leads to us and who then assist in selling to these prospects. This network includes global consulting firms, systems integrators and regional partners. In return, we typically pay these partners a fee based on the first-year subscription revenue generated by the customers whom they refer. Also included in this network are ISVs, whom we typically pay a percentage of the subscription revenue generated by their referrals. We continue to invest in developing additional distribution channels for our subscription service. Marketing Our marketing strategy is to promote our brand and generate demand for our offerings. We use a variety of marketing programs across traditional and social channels to target our prospective and current customers, partners, and developers. Our primary marketing activities include: ##TABLE_START    Press and industry analyst relations to garner third-party validation and generate positive coverage for our company, offerings and value proposition; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    User conferences and events, as well as participation in trade shows and industry events, to create customer and prospect awareness; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    Social marketing and engagement on social channels like Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn and YouTube; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    Search engine marketing and advertising to drive traffic to our Web properties; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    Web site development to engage and educate prospects and generate interest through product information and demonstrations, free trials, case studies, white papers, and marketing collateral; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    Multi-channel marketing campaigns; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    Use of customer testimonials; and ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    Sales tools and field marketing events to enable our sales organization to more effectively convert leads into customers. ##TABLE_END Customer Service and Support Our global customer support group responds to both business and technical inquiries about the use of our products via the web, telephone, email, social networks and other channels. We provide standard customer support during regular business hours at no charge to customers who purchase any of our paying subscription editions. We also offer premier customer support for an additional fee, which includes services such as priority access to technical resources, developer support, and/or system administration.  Seasonality Our fourth quarter has historically been our strongest quarter for new business and renewals. For a more detailed discussion, see the Seasonal Nature of Deferred Revenue and Accounts Receivable discussion in Managements Discussion and Analysis. Competition The market for our offerings is highly competitive, rapidly evolving and fragmented, and subject to changing technology, frequent introductions of new products and services, and as we have seen recently, consolidation. Many prospective customers have invested substantial personnel and financial resources to implement and integrate traditional enterprise software into their businesses, and therefore may be reluctant or unwilling to migrate to an enterprise cloud computing application service. Additionally, third party developers may be reluctant to build application services on our platform since they have invested in other competing technology platforms. We compete primarily with vendors of packaged business software and companies offering CRM apps. We also compete with internally developed apps and may encounter competition from enterprise software vendors and online service providers who may develop toolsets and products that allow customers to build new apps that run on the customers current infrastructure or as hosted services. Our current principal competitors include: ##TABLE_START    enterprise software application vendors; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    cloud computing application service providers; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    software companies that provide their product or service free of charge, and only charge a premium for advanced features and functionality; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    traditional platform development environment companies; and ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    cloud computing development platform companies. ##TABLE_END We believe that as traditional enterprise software application and platform vendors shift more of their focus to cloud computing, they will become a greater competitive threat. Intellectual Property We rely on a combination of trademark, copyright, trade secret and patent laws in the United States and other jurisdictions as well as confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions to protect our proprietary technology and our brand. We also enter into confidentiality and proprietary rights agreements with our employees, consultants and other third parties and control access to software, documentation and other proprietary information. Employees As of January 31, 2013, we had 9,800 employees. None of our employees are represented by a labor union.

", "1A": " ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones facing us. Other events that we do not currently anticipate or that we currently deem immaterial also may affect our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. Risks Related to Our Business and Industry Defects or disruptions in our service could diminish demand for our service and subject us to substantial liability. Because our service is complex and incorporates a variety of hardware and proprietary and third-party software, our service may have errors or defects that could result in unanticipated downtime for our subscribers and harm to our reputation and our business. Internet-based services frequently contain undetected errors when first introduced or when new versions or enhancements are released. We have from time to time found defects in our service and new errors in our service may be detected in the future. In addition, our customers may use our service in unanticipated ways that may cause a disruption in service for other customers attempting to access their data. As we acquire companies, we may encounter difficulty in incorporating the acquired technologies into our service and maintaining the quality standards that are consistent with our brand and reputation. Since our customers use our service for important aspects of their business, any errors, defects, disruptions in service or other performance problems could hurt our reputation and may damage our customers businesses. As a result, customers could elect to not renew, or delay or withhold payment to us, we could lose future sales or customers may make warranty or other claims against us, which could result in an increase in our provision for doubtful accounts, an increase in collection cycles for accounts receivable or the expense and risk of litigation. Interruptions or delays in service from our third-party data center hosting facilities could impair the delivery of our service and harm our business. We currently serve our customers from third-party data center hosting facilities located in the United States and other countries. Any damage to, or failure of, our systems generally could result in interruptions in our service. Interruptions in our service may reduce our revenue, cause us to issue credits or pay penalties, cause customers to terminate their subscriptions and adversely affect our renewal rates and our ability to attract new customers. Our business will also be harmed if our customers and potential customers believe our service is unreliable. As part of our current disaster recovery arrangements, our production environment and all of our customers data is currently replicated in near real-time in a facility located in the United States. Companies and products added through acquisition may be temporarily served through alternate facilities. We do not control the operation of any of these facilities, and they are vulnerable to damage or interruption from earthquakes, floods, fires, power loss, telecommunications failures and similar events. They may also be subject to break-ins, sabotage, intentional acts of vandalism and similar misconduct. Despite precautions taken at these facilities, the occurrence of a natural disaster or an act of terrorism, a decision to close the facilities without adequate notice or other unanticipated problems at these facilities could result in lengthy interruptions in our service. Even with the disaster recovery arrangements, our service could be interrupted. As we continue to add data centers and add capacity in our existing data centers, we may move or transfer our data and our customers data. Despite precautions taken during this process, any unsuccessful data transfers may impair the delivery of our service.  If our security measures are breached and unauthorized access is obtained to a customers data or our data or our IT systems, our service may be perceived as not being secure, customers may curtail or stop using our service and we may incur significant legal and financial exposure and liabilities. Our service involves the storage and transmission of customers proprietary information, and security breaches could expose us to a risk of loss of this information, litigation and possible liability. These security measures may be breached as a result of third-party action, including intentional misconduct by computer hackers, employee error, malfeasance or otherwise and result in someone obtaining unauthorized access to our customers data or our data, including our intellectual property and other confidential business information, or our IT systems. Additionally, third parties may attempt to fraudulently induce employees or customers into disclosing sensitive information such as user names, passwords or other information in order to gain access to our customers data or our data or IT systems. Because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access, or to sabotage systems, change frequently and generally are not recognized until launched against a target, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures. In addition, our customers may authorize third-party technology providers to access their customer data. Because we do not control our customers and third-party technology providers, or the processing of such data by third-party technology providers, we cannot ensure the integrity or security of such transmissions or processing. Malicious third-parties may also conduct attacks designed to temporarily deny customers access to our services. Any security breach could result in a loss of confidence in the security of our service, damage our reputation, negatively impact our future sales, disrupt our business and lead to legal liability. We rely on third-party computer hardware and software which could cause errors or failures of our service and may be difficult to replace. We rely on computer hardware purchased or leased and software licensed from third parties in order to offer our service, including database software from Oracle Corporation and hardware from a variety of vendors. Any errors or defects in third-party hardware or software could result in errors or a failure of our service which could harm our business. This hardware and software may not continue to be available at reasonable prices or on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. Any loss of the right to use any of this hardware or software could significantly increase our expenses and otherwise result in delays in the provisioning of our service until equivalent technology is either developed by us, or, if available, is identified, obtained through purchase or license and integrated into our service. Because we recognize revenue from subscriptions for our service over the term of the subscription, downturns or upturns in new business may not be immediately reflected in our operating results. We generally recognize revenue from customers ratably over the terms of their subscription agreements, which are typically 12 to 36 months. As a result, most of the revenue we report in each quarter is the result of subscription agreements entered into during previous quarters. Consequently, a decline in new or renewed subscriptions in any one quarter may not be reflected in our revenue results for that quarter. Any such decline, however, will negatively affect our revenue in future quarters. Accordingly, the effect of significant downturns in sales and market acceptance of our service, and potential changes in our rate of renewals may not be fully reflected in our results of operations until future periods. Our subscription model also makes it difficult for us to rapidly increase our revenue through additional sales in any period, as revenue from new customers must be recognized over the applicable subscription term. Our efforts to expand our service beyond the CRM market and to develop our existing service in order to keep pace with technological developments may not succeed and may reduce our revenue growth rate and/or harm our business. We derive substantially all of our revenue from subscriptions to our CRM enterprise cloud computing application service, and we expect this will continue for the foreseeable future. The markets for our Marketing Cloud and Salesforce Platform remain relatively new and it is uncertain whether our efforts will ever result in significant revenue for us. Further, the introduction of new services beyond the CRM market may not be  successful, and early stage interest and adoption of such new services may not result in long term success or significant revenue for us. Our efforts to expand our service beyond the CRM market may not succeed and may reduce our revenue growth rate. Additionally, if we are unable to develop enhancements to and new features for our existing service or new services that keep pace with rapid technological developments, our business will be harmed. The success of enhancements, new features and services depends on several factors, including the timely completion, introduction and market acceptance of the feature or edition. Failure in this regard may significantly impair our revenue growth. In addition, because our service is designed to operate on a variety of network hardware and software platforms using a standard browser, we will need to continuously modify and enhance our service to keep pace with changes in Internet-related hardware, software, communication, browser and database technologies. We may not be successful in either developing these modifications and enhancements or in bringing them to market timely. Furthermore, uncertainties about the timing and nature of new network platforms or technologies, or modifications to existing platforms or technologies, could increase our research and development or service delivery expenses. Any failure of our service to operate effectively with future network platforms and technologies could reduce the demand for our service, result in customer dissatisfaction and harm our business. If we experience significant fluctuations in our rate of anticipated growth and fail to balance our expenses with our revenue forecasts, our results could be harmed. Due to the pace of change and innovation in enterprise cloud computing services and the unpredictability of future general economic and financial market conditions, we may not be able to accurately forecast our rate of growth. We plan our expense levels and investment on estimates of future revenue and future anticipated rate of growth. We may not be able to adjust our spending appropriately if the addition of new subscriptions or the renewal rate for existing subscriptions falls short of our expectations. A portion of our expenses may also be a fixed cost in nature for some minimum amount of time, such as with a data center contract or office lease, so it may not be possible to reduce costs in a timely manner or without the payment of fees to exit certain obligations early. As a result, we expect that our revenues, operating results and cash flows may fluctuate significantly on a quarterly basis. Our recent revenue growth rates may not be sustainable and may decline in the future. We believe that period-to-period comparisons of our revenues, operating results and cash flows may not be meaningful and should not be relied upon as an indication of future performance. We cannot accurately predict subscription renewal or upgrade rates and the impact these rates may have on our future revenue and operating results. Our customers have no obligation to renew their subscriptions for our service after the expiration of their initial subscription period, which is typically 12 to 36 months, and in fact, some customers have elected not to renew. In addition, our customers may renew for fewer subscriptions, renew for shorter contract lengths, or renew for lower cost editions of our service. We cannot accurately predict renewal rates given our varied customer base of enterprise and small and medium size business customers and the number of multiyear subscription contracts. Our renewal rates may decline or fluctuate as a result of a number of factors, including customer dissatisfaction with our service, customers spending levels, decreases in the number of users at our customers, pricing changes and deteriorating general economic conditions. If our customers do not renew their subscriptions for our service or reduce the number of paying subscriptions at the time of renewal, our revenue will decline and our business will suffer. Our future success also depends in part on our ability to sell additional features and services, more subscriptions or enhanced editions of our service to our current customers. This may also require increasingly sophisticated and costly sales efforts that are targeted at senior management. Similarly, the rate at which our customers purchase new or enhanced services depends on a number of factors, including general economic  conditions and that our customers do not react negatively to any price changes related to these additional features and services. If our efforts to upsell to our customers are not successful and negative reaction occurs, our business may suffer. Our quarterly results can fluctuate and our stock price and the value of your investment could decline substantially. Our quarterly results are likely to fluctuate. For example, our fiscal fourth quarter has historically been our strongest quarter for new business and renewals. The year-over-year compounding effect of this seasonality in billing patterns and overall new business and renewal activity causes the value of invoices that we generate in the fourth quarter to continually increase in proportion to our billings in the other three quarters of our fiscal year. Additionally, some of the important factors that may cause our revenues, operating results and cash flows to fluctuate from quarter to quarter include: ##TABLE_START    our ability to retain and increase sales to existing customers, attract new customers and satisfy our customers requirements; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    the renewal rates for our service; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    the amount and timing of operating costs and capital expenditures related to the operations and expansion of our business; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    changes in deferred revenue and unbilled deferred revenue balances, which are not reflected in the balance sheet, due to seasonality, the compounding effects of renewals, invoice duration, invoice timing and new business linearity; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    the number of new employees; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    changes in our pricing policies and terms of contracts, whether initiated by us or as a result of competition; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    the cost, timing and management effort for the introduction of new features to our service; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    the costs associated with acquiring new businesses and technologies and the follow-on costs of integration and consolidating the results of acquired businesses; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    the rate of expansion and productivity of our sales force; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    the length of the sales cycle for our service; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    new product and service introductions by our competitors; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    our success in selling our service to large enterprises; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    variations in the revenue mix of editions of our service; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    technical difficulties or interruptions in our service; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    expenses related to our real estate, our office leases and our data center capacity and expansion; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    changes in foreign currency exchange rates; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    changes in interest rates and our mix of investments, which would impact our return on our investments in cash and marketable securities; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    conditions, particularly sudden changes, in the financial markets have and may continue to impact the value of and access to our investment portfolio; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    changes in the effective tax rates due to changes in the mix of earnings and losses in countries with differing statutory tax rates, certain non-deductible expenses, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities and our ability to utilize them, changes in federal, state or international tax laws ##TABLE_END  ##TABLE_START  and accounting principles, changes in judgment from the evaluation of new information that results in a recognition, derecognition or change in measurement of a tax position taken in a prior period, results of tax examinations by the Internal Revenue Service, state and foreign taxing authorities, as well as changes in excess tax benefits related to exercises and vesting of stock-based compensation that are allocated directly to stockholders equity; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    expenses related to significant, unusual or discrete events which are recorded in the period in which the events occur; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    general economic conditions that may adversely affect either our customers ability or willingness to purchase additional subscriptions or upgrade their service, or delay a prospective customers purchasing decision, or reduce the value of new subscription contracts, or affect renewal rates; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    timing of additional investments in our enterprise cloud computing application and platform services and in our consulting service; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    regulatory compliance costs; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    the timing of customer payments and payment defaults by customers; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    extraordinary expenses such as litigation or other dispute-related settlement payments; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    any adverse resolution to income tax audits in any tax jurisdictions throughout the world; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    the impact of new accounting pronouncements; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    equity issuances, including as consideration in acquisitions or due to the conversion of our outstanding convertible notes at the election of the note holders; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    the timing of stock awards to employees and the related adverse financial statement impact of having to expense those stock awards ratably over their vesting schedules; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    the timing of commission, bonus, and other compensation payments to employees; and ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    the timing of payroll and other withholding tax expenses which is triggered by the payment of bonuses and when employees exercise their vested stock awards. ##TABLE_END Many of these factors are outside of our control, and the occurrence of one or more of them might cause our operating results to vary widely. As such, we believe that quarter-to-quarter comparisons of our revenues, operating results, changes in our deferred revenue and unbilled deferred revenue balances and cash flows may not be meaningful and should not be relied upon as an indication of future performance. Additionally, we may fail to meet or exceed the expectations of securities analysts and investors, and the market price of our common stock could decline. If one or more of the securities analysts who cover us adversely change their recommendation regarding our stock, the market price of our common stock could decline. Moreover, our stock price may be based on expectations, estimates or forecasts of our future performance that may be unrealistic or that may not be met. Further, our stock price may fluctuate based on reporting by the financial media, including television, radio and press reports and blogs. We expect to incur net GAAP losses in the future. We have incurred net losses in each fiscal quarter since July 31, 2011. In addition, we expect our costs to increase as a result of decisions made for our long-term benefit, such as equity awards and business combinations. Additionally, for the foreseeable future, we must maintain a substantial valuation allowance against our deferred income tax asset balance. If our revenue does not grow to offset these expected increased costs, we will not be able to return to profitability and we may continue to incur net losses, on a U.S. GAAP basis, in the future.  The market in which we participate is intensely competitive, and if we do not compete effectively, our operating results could be harmed. The market for enterprise applications and platform services is highly competitive, rapidly evolving and fragmented, and subject to changing technology, shifting customer needs and frequent introductions of new products and services. We compete primarily with vendors of packaged CRM software and companies offering on-demand CRM applications. We also compete with internally developed applications and face competition from enterprise software vendors and online service providers who may develop toolsets and products that allow customers to build new applications that run on the customers current infrastructure or as hosted services. Our current competitors include: ##TABLE_START    enterprise software application vendors; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    cloud computing application service providers; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    software companies that provide their product or service free of charge, and only charge a premium for advanced features and functionality; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    traditional platform development environment companies; and ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    cloud computing development platform companies. ##TABLE_END Many of our current and potential competitors enjoy substantial competitive advantages, such as greater name recognition, longer operating histories and larger marketing budgets, as well as substantially greater financial, technical and other resources. In addition, many of our current and potential competitors have established marketing relationships and access to larger customer bases, and have major distribution agreements with consultants, system integrators and resellers. As a result, our competitors may be able to respond more quickly and effectively than we can to new or changing opportunities, technologies, standards or customer requirements. Furthermore, because of these advantages, even if our service is more effective than the products that our competitors offer, potential customers might accept competitive products and services in lieu of purchasing our service. For all of these reasons, we may not be able to compete successfully against our current and future competitors. As we acquire companies or technologies, we may not realize the expected business benefits, the acquisitions could prove difficult to integrate, disrupt our business, dilute stockholder value and adversely affect our operating results and the value of your investment. As part of our business strategy, we periodically make investments in, or acquisitions of, complementary businesses, joint ventures, services and technologies and intellectual property rights, and we expect that we will continue to make such investments and acquisitions in the future. Acquisitions and investments involve numerous risks, including: ##TABLE_START    the potential failure to achieve the expected benefits of the combination or acquisition; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    difficulties in and the cost of integrating operations, technologies, services and personnel; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    diversion of financial and managerial resources from existing operations; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    risk of entering new markets in which we have little or no experience or where competitors may have stronger market positions; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    potential write-offs of acquired assets or investments, and potential financial and credit risks associated with acquired customers; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    potential loss of key employees; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    inability to generate sufficient revenue to offset acquisition or investment costs; ##TABLE_END  ##TABLE_START    the inability to maintain relationships with customers and partners of the acquired business; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    the difficulty of transitioning the acquired technology onto our existing platforms and maintaining the security standards consistent with our other services for such technology; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    potential unknown liabilities associated with the acquired businesses; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    unanticipated expenses related to acquired technology and its integration into existing technology; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    negative impact to our results of operations because of the depreciation and amortization of amounts related to acquired intangible assets, fixed assets and deferred compensation, and the loss of acquired deferred revenue; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    delays in customer purchases due to uncertainty related to any acquisition; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    the need to implement controls, procedures and policies at the acquired company; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    challenges caused by distance, language and cultural differences; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    in the case of foreign acquisitions, the challenges associated with integrating operations across different cultures and languages and any currency and regulatory risks associated with specific countries; and ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    the tax effects of any such acquisitions. ##TABLE_END In addition, if we finance acquisitions by issuing equity or convertible or other debt securities, our existing stockholders may be diluted or we could face constraints related to the terms of and repayment obligation related to the incurrence of indebtedness which could affect the market price of our common stock. Further, if we fail to properly evaluate and execute acquisitions or investments, our business and prospects may be seriously harmed and the value of your investment may decline. If the market for our technology delivery model and enterprise cloud computing services develops more slowly than we expect, our business could be harmed. Our success also depends on the willingness of third-party developers to build applications that are complementary to our service. Without the development of these applications, both current and potential customers may not find our service sufficiently attractive. In addition, for those customers who authorize a third-party technology partner access to their data, we do not provide any warranty related to the functionality, security and integrity of the data transmission or processing. Despite contract provisions to protect us, customers may look to us to support and provide warranties for the third-party applications, which may expose us to potential claims, liabilities and obligations for applications we did not develop or sell. Supporting our existing and growing customer base could strain our personnel resources and infrastructure, and if we are unable to scale our operations and increase productivity, we may not be able to successfully implement our business plan. We continue to experience significant growth in our customer base, which has placed a strain on our management, administrative, operational and financial infrastructure. We anticipate that additional investments in our infrastructure, research and development, and real estate spending will be required to scale our operations and increase productivity, to address the needs of our customers, to further develop and enhance our service, to expand into new geographic areas, and to scale with the overall growth of our Company. We regularly upgrade and/or replace our various software systems. If the implementations of these new applications are delayed, or if we encounter unforeseen problems with our new systems or in migrating away from our existing applications and systems, our operations and our ability to manage our business could be negatively impacted. Our success will depend in part upon the ability of our senior management to manage our projected growth effectively. To do so, we must continue to increase the productivity of our existing employees and to hire, train  and manage new employees as needed. To manage the expected domestic and international growth of our operations and personnel, we will need to continue to improve our operational, financial and management controls, our reporting systems and procedures, and our utilization of real estate. The additional investments we are making will increase our cost base, which will make it more difficult for us to offset any future revenue shortfalls by reducing expenses in the short term. If we fail to successfully scale our operations and increase productivity, we will be unable to execute our business plan. As more of our sales efforts are targeted at larger enterprise customers, our sales cycle may become more time-consuming and expensive, we may encounter pricing pressure and implementation and customization challenges, and we may have to delay revenue recognition for some complex transactions, all of which could harm our business and operating results. As we target more of our sales efforts at larger enterprise customers, we will face greater costs, longer sales cycles and less predictability in completing some of our sales. In this market segment, the customers decision to use our service may be an enterprise-wide decision and, if so, these types of sales would require us to provide greater levels of education regarding the use and benefits of our service, as well as education regarding privacy and data protection laws and regulations to prospective customers with international operations. In addition, larger customers may demand more customization, integration services and features. As a result of these factors, these sales opportunities may require us to devote greater sales support and professional services resources to individual customers, driving up costs and time required to complete sales and diverting our own sales and professional services resources to a smaller number of larger transactions, while potentially requiring us to delay revenue recognition on some of these transactions until the technical or implementation requirements have been met. Professional services may also be performed by a third party or a combination of our own staff and a third party. Our strategy is to work with third parties to increase the breadth of capability and depth of capacity for delivery of these services to our customers. If a customer is not satisfied with the quality of work performed by us or a third party or with the type of services or solutions delivered, then we could incur additional costs to address the situation, the profitability of that work might be impaired, and the customers dissatisfaction with our services could damage our ability to obtain additional work from that customer. In addition, negative publicity related to our customer relationships, regardless of its accuracy, may further damage our business by affecting our ability to compete for new business with current and prospective customers. Periodic changes to our sales organization can be disruptive and may reduce our rate of growth. We periodically change and make adjustments to our sales organization in response to market opportunities, competitive threats, management changes, product introductions or enhancements, acquisitions, sales performance, increases in sales headcount, cost levels and other internal and external considerations. In the past, these changes sometimes resulted in a temporary lack of focus and reduced productivity; these effects could recur in connection with any future sales changes we might undertake and our rate of revenue growth could be negatively affected. In addition, any significant change to the way we structure our compensation of our sales organization may be disruptive and may affect our revenue growth. Sales to customers outside the United States expose us to risks inherent in international sales. We sell our service throughout the world and are subject to risks and challenges associated with international business. Historically, sales in Europe and Asia Pacific together have represented over 30 percent of our total revenues, and we intend to continue to expand our international sales efforts. The risks and challenges associated with sales to customers outside the United States include: ##TABLE_START    localization of our service, including translation into foreign languages and associated expenses; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    laws and business practices favoring local competitors; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    compliance with multiple, conflicting and changing governmental laws and regulations, including employment, tax, privacy and data protection laws and regulations; ##TABLE_END  ##TABLE_START    pressure on the creditworthiness of sovereign nations, particularly in Europe, where we have customers and a balance of our cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities. Liquidity issues or political actions by sovereign nations could result in decreased values of these balances; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    regional data privacy laws that apply to the transmission of our customers data across international borders; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    treatment of revenue from international sources and changes to tax codes, including being subject to foreign tax laws and being liable for paying withholding income or other taxes in foreign jurisdictions; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    foreign currency fluctuations and controls; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    different pricing environments; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    different or lesser protection of our intellectual property; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    longer accounts receivable payment cycles and other collection difficulties; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    natural disasters, acts of war, terrorism, pandemics or security breaches; and ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    regional economic and political conditions. ##TABLE_END Any of these factors could negatively impact our business and results of operations. Additionally, our international subscription fees are paid either in U.S. dollars or local currency. As a result, fluctuations in the value of the U.S. dollar and foreign currencies may make our service more expensive for international customers, which could harm our business. We have been and may in the future be sued by third parties for various claims including alleged infringement of proprietary rights. We are involved in various legal matters arising from the normal course of business activities. These may include claims, suits, government investigations and other proceedings involving alleged infringement of third-party patents and other intellectual property rights, and commercial, corporate and securities, labor and employment, wage and hour, and other matters. The software and Internet industries are characterized by the existence of a large number of patents, trademarks and copyrights and by frequent litigation based on allegations of infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights. We have received in the past and may receive in the future communications from third parties, including practicing entities and non-practicing entities, claiming that we have infringed their intellectual property rights. For example, we have received a notice from a large non-practicing entity alleging that we infringe upon certain of its patents. We continue to analyze the potential merits of such claim, if any, the potential defenses and counterclaims to such claim and we have been engaged in discussions with this entity with respect to these matters. No litigation has been filed to date. In addition, we have been, and may in the future be, sued by third parties for alleged infringement of their claimed proprietary rights. Our technologies may be subject to injunction if they are found to infringe the rights of a third party or we may be required to pay damages, or both. Many of our subscription agreements require us to indemnify our customers for third-party intellectual property infringement claims, which would increase the cost to us of an adverse ruling on such a claim. The outcome of any claims or litigation, regardless of the merits, is inherently uncertain. Any claims and lawsuits, and the disposition of such claims and lawsuits, whether through settlement or licensing discussions, or litigation, could be time-consuming and expensive to resolve, divert management attention from executing our business plan, result in efforts to enjoin our activities, lead to attempts on the part of other parties to pursue similar claims and, in the case of intellectual property claims, require us to change our technology, change our business practices and/or pay monetary damages or enter into short- or long-term royalty or licensing agreements.  Any adverse determination related to intellectual property claims or other litigation could prevent us from offering our service to others, could be material to our financial condition or cash flows, or both, or could otherwise adversely affect our operating results. In addition, depending on the nature and timing of any such dispute, an unfavorable resolution of a legal matter could materially affect our future results of operation or cash flows or both. In addition, our exposure to risks associated with various claims, including the use of intellectual property, may be increased as a result of acquisitions of other companies. For example, we may have a lower level of visibility into the development process with respect to intellectual property or the care taken to safeguard against infringement risks with respect to the acquired company or technology. In addition, third parties may make infringement and similar or related claims after we have acquired technology that had not been asserted prior to our acquisition. Any failure to protect our intellectual property rights could impair our ability to protect our proprietary technology and our brand. If we fail to protect our intellectual property rights adequately, our competitors may gain access to our technology, and our business may be harmed. In addition, defending our intellectual property rights may entail significant expense. Any of our patents, trademarks or other intellectual property rights may be challenged by others or invalidated through administrative process or litigation. While we have some U.S. patents and many U.S. and international patent applications pending, we may be unable to obtain patent protection for the technology covered in our patent applications. In addition, our existing patents and any patents issued in the future may not provide us with competitive advantages, or may be successfully challenged by third parties. Furthermore, legal standards relating to the validity, enforceability and scope of protection of intellectual property rights are uncertain. Effective patent, trademark, copyright and trade secret protection may not be available to us in every country in which our service is available. The laws of some foreign countries may not be as protective of intellectual property rights as those in the U.S., and mechanisms for enforcement of intellectual property rights may be inadequate. Accordingly, despite our efforts, we may be unable to prevent third parties from infringing upon or misappropriating our intellectual property. We may be required to spend significant resources to monitor and protect our intellectual property rights. We may initiate claims or litigation against third parties for infringement of our proprietary rights or to establish the validity of our proprietary rights. Any litigation, whether or not it is resolved in our favor, could result in significant expense to us and divert the efforts of our technical and management personnel. Privacy concerns and laws, evolving regulation of the Internet, cross-border data transfers and other domestic or foreign regulations may limit the use and adoption of our solution and adversely affect our business. As Internet commerce continues to evolve, increasing regulation by federal, state or foreign governments and agencies becomes more likely. For example, we believe increased regulation is occurring in the area of data privacy, and laws and regulations applying to the solicitation, collection, processing or use of personal or consumer information could affect our customers ability to use and share data, potentially reducing demand for our solutions and restricting our ability to store, process and share data with our customers. Our customers can use our service to store contact and other personal or identifying information regarding their customers and contacts. Federal, state and foreign governments and agencies have adopted or are considering adopting laws and regulations regarding the collection, use and disclosure of personal information obtained from consumers and individuals in addition to laws and regulations that impact the cross-border transfer of personal information. The costs of compliance with, and other burdens imposed by, such laws and regulations that are applicable to the businesses of our customers may limit the use and adoption of our service and reduce overall demand for it, or lead to significant fines, penalties or liabilities for any noncompliance with such privacy laws. Furthermore, privacy concerns may cause our customers customers to resist providing the personal data  necessary to allow our customers to use our service effectively. Even the perception of privacy concerns, whether or not valid, may inhibit market adoption of our service in certain industries. In addition to government activity, privacy advocacy groups and the technology and other industries are considering various new, additional or different self-regulatory standards that may place additional burdens on us. If the gathering of personal information were to be curtailed in this manner, CRM solutions would be less effective, which may reduce demand for our service and harm our business. Our continued success depends on our ability to maintain and enhance our brands. We believe that the brand identities we have developed have significantly contributed to the success of our business. Maintaining and enhancing the salesforce.com brand and our other brands are critical to expanding our base of customers, partners and employees. Our brands will depend largely on our ability to remain a technology leader and continue to provide high-quality innovative products, services, and features. In order to maintain and enhance our brands, we may be required to make substantial investments that may later prove to be unsuccessful. If we fail to maintain and enhance our brands, or if we incur excessive expenses in our efforts to do so, our business, operating results and financial condition may be materially and adversely affected. We may lose key members of our management team or development and operations personnel, and may be unable to attract and retain employees we need to support our operations and growth. Our success depends substantially upon the continued services of our executive officers and other key members of management, particularly our Chief Executive Officer. From time to time, there may be changes in our executive management team resulting from the hiring or departure of executives. Such changes in our executive management team may be disruptive to our business. We are also substantially dependent on the continued service of our existing development and operations personnel because of the complexity of our service and technologies. We do not have employment agreements with any of our executive officers, key management, development or operations personnel and they could terminate their employment with us at any time. The loss of one or more of our key employees or groups could seriously harm our business. In the technology industry, there is substantial and continuous competition for engineers with high levels of experience in designing, developing and managing software and Internet-related services, as well as competition for sales executives and operations personnel. We may not be successful in attracting and retaining qualified personnel. We have from time to time experienced, and we expect to continue to experience, difficulty in hiring and retaining highly skilled employees with appropriate qualifications. If we fail to attract new personnel or fail to retain and motivate our current personnel, our business and future growth prospects could be severely harmed. Any failure in our delivery of high-quality technical support services may adversely affect our relationships with our customers and our financial results. Our customers depend on our support organization to resolve technical issues relating to our applications. We may be unable to respond quickly enough to accommodate short-term increases in customer demand for support services. Increased customer demand for these services, without corresponding revenues, could increase costs and adversely affect our operating results. In addition, our sales process is highly dependent on our applications and business reputation and on positive recommendations from our existing customers. Any failure to maintain high-quality technical support, or a market perception that we do not maintain high-quality support, could adversely affect our reputation, our ability to sell our enterprise cloud computing solutions to existing and prospective customers, and our business, operating results and financial position. We may not realize any benefits in connection with our purchase of undeveloped land in San Francisco. If we do not realize any benefits, our financial performance may be negatively impacted. In November 2010, we purchased approximately 14 acres of undeveloped real estate in San Francisco, California, including entitlements and improvements associated with the land. We may not realize any benefits  with respect to the purchase of such real estate. During the first quarter of fiscal 2013, we suspended pre-construction activity on the land. If we commence efforts to develop the real estate, we will be required to devote substantial additional resources in the future, which may impact our liquidity and financial flexibility. In the event that we decide to sell this property, the sale price may be less than the recorded value of the land on our consolidated balance sheet, and our financial results may be negatively impacted. Weakened global economic conditions may adversely affect our industry, business and results of operations. Our overall performance depends in part on worldwide economic conditions. The United States and other key international economies have experienced in the past a downturn in which economic activity was impacted by falling demand for a variety of goods and services, restricted credit, poor liquidity, reduced corporate profitability, volatility in credit, equity and foreign exchange markets, bankruptcies and overall uncertainty with respect to the economy. The European Union continues to face great economic uncertainty which could impact the overall world economy or various other regional economies. These conditions affect the rate of information technology spending and could adversely affect our customers ability or willingness to purchase our enterprise cloud computing services, delay prospective customers purchasing decisions, reduce the value or duration of their subscription contracts, or affect renewal rates, all of which could adversely affect our operating results. Natural disasters and other events beyond our control could materially adversely affect us. Natural disasters or other catastrophic events may cause damage or disruption to our operations, international commerce and the global economy, and thus could have a strong negative effect on us. Our business operations are subject to interruption by natural disasters, fire, power shortages, pandemics and other events beyond our control. Although we maintain crisis management and disaster response plans, such events could make it difficult or impossible for us to deliver our services to our customers, and could decrease demand for our services. The majority of our research and development activities, corporate headquarters, information technology systems, and other critical business operations, are located near major seismic faults in the San Francisco Bay Area. Because we do not carry earthquake insurance for direct quake-related losses, and significant recovery time could be required to resume operations, our financial condition and operating results could be materially adversely affected in the event of a major earthquake or catastrophic event. Risks Relating to Capitalization Matters The market price of our common stock is likely to be volatile and could subject us to litigation. The trading prices of the securities of technology companies have been highly volatile. Accordingly, the market price of our common stock has been and is likely to continue to be subject to wide fluctuations. Factors affecting the market price of our common stock include: ##TABLE_START    variations in our operating results, earnings per share, cash flows from operating activities, deferred revenue and other financial metrics and non-financial metrics, and how those results compare to analyst expectations; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    forward looking guidance to industry and financial analysts related to future revenue and earnings per share; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    changes in the estimates of our operating results or changes in recommendations by securities analysts that elect to follow our common stock; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    announcements of technological innovations, new services or service enhancements, strategic alliances or significant agreements by us or by our competitors; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    announcements by us or by our competitors of mergers or other strategic acquisitions, or rumors of such transactions involving us or our competitors; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    announcements of customer additions and customer cancellations or delays in customer purchases; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    recruitment or departure of key personnel; ##TABLE_END  ##TABLE_START    disruptions in our service due to computer hardware, software, network or data center problems; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    the economy as a whole, market conditions in our industry and the industries of our customers; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    trading activity by a limited number of stockholders who together beneficially own a majority of our outstanding common stock; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    corporate actions, including our proposal to increase our authorized share capital to be voted upon by our stockholders in March 2013 and our related contingent stock split proposal; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    the issuance of shares of common stock by us, whether in connection with an acquisition, a capital raising transaction or upon conversion of some or all of our outstanding convertible senior notes; and ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    any other factors discussed herein. ##TABLE_END In addition, if the market for technology stocks or the stock market in general experiences uneven investor confidence, the market price of our common stock could decline for reasons unrelated to our business, operating results or financial condition. The market price of our common stock might also decline in reaction to events that affect other companies within, or outside, our industry even if these events do not directly affect us. Some companies that have experienced volatility in the trading price of their stock have been the subject of securities class action litigation. If we are the subject of such litigation, it could result in substantial costs and a diversion of managements attention and resources. Provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws, Delaware law and our outstanding convertible notes might discourage, delay or prevent a change of control of our company or changes in our management and, therefore, depress the market price of our common stock. Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that could depress the market price of our common stock by acting to discourage, delay or prevent a change in control of our company or changes in our management that the stockholders of our company may deem advantageous. These provisions among other things: ##TABLE_START    establish a classified board of directors so that not all members of our board are elected at one time; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    permit the board of directors to establish the number of directors; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    provide that directors may only be removed for cause and only with the approval of 66 2/3 percent of our stockholders; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    require super-majority voting to amend some provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    authorize the issuance of blank check preferred stock that our board could use to implement a stockholder rights plan (also known as a poison pill); ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    eliminate the ability of our stockholders to call special meetings of stockholders; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    prohibit stockholder action by written consent, which requires all stockholder actions to be taken at a meeting of our stockholders; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    provide that the board of directors is expressly authorized to make, alter or repeal our bylaws; and ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    establish advance notice requirements for nominations for election to our board or for proposing matters that can be acted upon by stockholders at annual stockholder meetings. ##TABLE_END In addition, Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law may discourage, delay or prevent a change in control of our company. Section 203 imposes certain restrictions on merger, business combinations and other transactions between us and holders of 15 percent or more of our common stock.  In addition, the fundamental change purchase rights applicable to our convertible notes, which will allow note holders to require us to purchase all or a portion of their notes upon the occurrence of a fundamental change, and the provisions requiring an increase to the conversion rate for conversions in connection with a make-whole fundamental change may in certain circumstances delay or prevent a takeover of us and the removal of incumbent management that might otherwise be beneficial to investors.

PROPERTIES As of January 31, 2013, our executive offices and principal office for domestic marketing, sales, professional services and development occupy over 950,000 square feet in the San Francisco Bay Area. We also lease space in various locations throughout the United States for local sales and professional services personnel. Our foreign subsidiaries lease office space for their operations including local sales and professional services personnel. We also own approximately 14 acres of undeveloped real estate in San Francisco, California, including entitlements and improvements associated with the land. We believe that our existing facilities and offices are adequate to meet our current requirements. See Note 10, Commitments, in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information about our lease commitments. If we require additional space, we believe that we will be able to obtain such space on acceptable, commercially reasonable terms. ", "3": " ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS In the ordinary course of business, we are involved in various legal proceedings and claims related to alleged infringement of third-party patents and other intellectual property rights, commercial, corporate and securities, labor and employment, wage and hour, and other claims. We have been, and may in the future be, put on notice and/or sued by third parties for alleged infringement of their proprietary rights, including patent infringement. For example, we have received a notice from a large non-practicing entity alleging that we infringe upon certain of its patents. We continue to analyze the potential merits of such claim, if any, the potential defenses and counterclaims to such claim and we have been engaged in discussions with this entity with respect to these matters. No litigation has been filed to date. We evaluate all claims and lawsuits with respect to their potential merits, our potential defenses and counter claims, settlement or litigation potential and the expected effect on us. Our technologies may be subject to injunction if they are found to infringe the rights of a third party. In addition, many of our subscription agreements require us to indemnify our customers for third-party intellectual property infringement claims, which could increase the cost to us of an adverse ruling on such a claim. The outcome of any claims or litigation, regardless of the merits, is inherently uncertain. Any claims and other lawsuits, and the disposition of such claims and lawsuits, whether through settlement or litigation, could be time-consuming and expensive to resolve, divert our attention from executing our business plan, result in efforts to enjoin our activities, lead to attempts by third parties to seek similar claims and, in the case of intellectual property claims, require us to change our technology, change our business practices and/or pay monetary damages or enter into short- or long-term royalty or licensing agreements. In general, the resolution of a legal matter could prevent us from offering our service to others, could be material to our financial condition or cash flows, or both, or could otherwise adversely affect our operating results.  We make a provision for a liability relating to legal matters when it is both probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. These provisions are reviewed at least quarterly and adjusted to reflect the impacts of negotiations, estimated settlements, legal rulings, advice of legal counsel and other information and events pertaining to a particular matter. In our opinion, resolution of all current matters is not expected to have a material adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations, cash flows or financial position. However, depending on the nature and timing of any such dispute, an unfavorable resolution of a matter could materially affect our future results of operations or cash flows, or both, of a particular quarter.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS ##TABLE_END The following discussion contains forward-looking statements, including, without limitation, our expectations and statements regarding our outlook and future revenues, expenses, results of operations, liquidity, plans, strategies and objectives of management and any assumptions underlying any of the foregoing. Our actual results may differ significantly from those projected in the forward-looking statements. Our forward-looking statements and factors that might cause future actual results to differ materially from our recent results or those projected in the forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, those discussed in the section titled Forward-Looking Information and Risk Factors of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Except as required by law, we assume no obligation to update the forward-looking statements or our risk factors for any reason. Overview We are a provider of enterprise cloud computing solutions. We were founded on the simple concept of delivering customer relationship management, or CRM, applications via the Internet, or cloud. We introduced our first CRM solution in February 2000 and we have expanded our offerings with new editions, solutions and enhanced features, through internal development and acquisitions. We sell to businesses of all sizes and in almost every industry worldwide on a subscription basis. Our mission is to help our customers transform themselves into customer companies by empowering them to connect with their customers, partners, employees and products in entirely new ways. Our objective is to deliver solutions to help companies transform the way they sell, service, market and innovate. With our four core servicesSales Cloud, Service Cloud, Marketing Cloud and the Salesforce Platformcustomers have the tools they need to build a next generation social front office with our social and mobile cloud technologies. Key elements of our strategy include: ##TABLE_START    Strengthening our market-leading core solutions; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    Innovating in high-growth markets; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    Improve renewal rates; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    Deepening relationships with our existing customer base; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    Pursuing new customers aggressively; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    Building our business in top markets globally; and ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    Encouraging the development of third-party applications on our cloud computing platforms. ##TABLE_END We believe the factors that will influence our ability to achieve our objectives include: our prospective customers willingness to migrate to enterprise cloud computing services; the availability, performance and security of our service; our ability to continue to release, and gain customer acceptance of, new and improved features; our ability to successfully integrate acquired businesses and technologies; successful customer adoption and utilization of our service; acceptance of our service in markets where we have few customers; the emergence of additional competitors in our market and improved product offerings by existing and new competitors; the location of new data centers; third-party developers willingness to develop applications on our platforms; our ability to attract new personnel and retain and motivate current personnel; and general economic conditions which could affect our customers ability and willingness to purchase our services, delay the customers purchasing decision or affect renewal rates. To address these factors, we will need to, among other things, continue to add substantial numbers of paying subscriptions, upgrade our customers to fully featured versions such as our Unlimited Edition or arrangements such as a Social Enterprise License Agreement, provide high quality technical support to our customers,  encourage the development of third-party applications on our platforms and continue to focus on retaining customers at the time of renewal. Our plans to invest for future growth include the continuation of the expansion of our data center capacity, the hiring of additional personnel, particularly in direct sales, other customer-related areas and research and development, the expansion of domestic and international selling and marketing activities, continuing to develop our brands, the addition of distribution channels, the upgrade of our service offerings, the development of new services, the integration of acquired technologies, the expansion of our Marketing Cloud and Salesforce Platform service offerings and the additions to our global infrastructure to support our growth. We also regularly evaluate acquisitions or investment opportunities in complementary businesses, joint ventures, services and technologies, and intellectual property rights in an effort to expand our service offerings. We expect to continue to make such investments and acquisitions in the future and we plan to reinvest a significant portion of our incremental revenue in fiscal 2014 to grow our business and continue our leadership role in the cloud computing industry. As a result of our aggressive growth plans, specifically our hiring plan and acquisition activities, we have incurred significant expenses from equity awards and amortization of purchased intangibles which have resulted in net losses on a GAAP basis. As we continue with our growth plan, we anticipate we will have net losses on a GAAP basis for the next several quarters. In November 2010, we purchased approximately 14 acres of undeveloped real estate in San Francisco, California, including entitlements and improvements associated with the land. We have capitalized all pre-construction activities related to the development of the land, including interest costs and property taxes since the November 2010 purchase. During the first quarter of fiscal 2013, we suspended pre-construction activity. The total carrying value of the land, building improvements and perpetual parking rights was $321.1 million as of January 31, 2013. We continue to evaluate our future needs for office facilities space and our options for the undeveloped real estate. We expect marketing and sales costs, which were 53 percent of our total revenues for fiscal 2013 and 52 percent for fiscal 2012, to continue to represent a substantial portion of total revenues in the future as we seek to add and manage more paying subscribers, and build greater brand awareness. On August 13, 2012, we acquired the outstanding stock of Buddy Media, Inc., (Buddy), a social media marketing platform. We acquired Buddy for the assembled workforce, expected synergies and expanded market opportunities when integrating Buddys social media marketing platform with our current offerings. The financial results of Buddy are included in our consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisition. The total purchase price for Buddy was $735.8 million. We regularly assess the need for a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets. In making that assessment, we consider both positive and negative evidence related to the likelihood of realization of the deferred tax assets to determine, based on the weight of available evidence, whether it is more-likely-than-not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. In our evaluation, we considered our cumulative loss in recent years and our forecasted future losses as significant pieces of negative evidence. During the third quarter of fiscal 2013, we determined that the negative evidence outweighed the positive evidence as of October 31, 2013 and recorded a one-time, non-cash charge to income tax expense in the third quarter of fiscal 2013 in the amount of $149.1 million to establish a valuation allowance for a significant portion of our deferred tax assets. This accounting treatment has no effect on our actual ability to utilize deferred tax assets such as loss carryforwards and tax credits to reduce future cash tax payments. We will continue to assess the realizability of the deferred tax assets in each of the applicable jurisdictions going forward and adjust the valuation allowance accordingly. Fiscal Year Our fiscal year ends on January 31. References to fiscal 2013, for example, refer to the fiscal year ending January 31, 2013.  Sources of Revenues We derive our revenues from two sources: (1) subscription revenues, which are comprised of subscription fees from customers accessing our enterprise cloud computing services and from customers purchasing additional support beyond the standard support that is included in the basic subscription fees; and (2) related professional services such as process mapping, project management, implementation services and other revenue. Other revenue consists primarily of training fees. Subscription and support revenues accounted for approximately 94 percent of our total revenues during fiscal 2013. Subscription revenues are driven primarily by the number of paying subscribers, varying service types, the price of our service and service renewal rates. We define a customer as a separate and distinct buying entity (e.g., a company, a distinct business unit of a large corporation, a partnership, etc.) that has entered into a contract to access our enterprise cloud computing services. We define a subscription as a unique user account purchased by a customer for use by its employees or other customer-authorized users, and we refer to each such user as a subscriber. The number of paying subscriptions at each of our customers ranges from one to hundreds of thousands. None of our customers accounted for more than five percent of our revenues during fiscal 2013, 2012, or 2011. Subscription and support revenues are recognized ratably over the contract terms beginning on the commencement dates of each contract. The typical subscription and support term is 12 to 36 months, although terms range from one to 60 months. Our subscription and support contracts are non-cancelable, though customers typically have the right to terminate their contracts for cause if we materially fail to perform. We generally invoice our customers in advance, in annual or quarterly installments, and typical payment terms provide that our customers pay us within 30 days of invoice. Amounts that have been invoiced are recorded in accounts receivable and in deferred revenue, or in revenue depending on whether the revenue recognition criteria have been met. In general, we collect our billings in advance of the subscription service period. Professional services and other revenues consist of fees associated with consulting and implementation services and training. Our consulting and implementation engagements are typically billed on a time and materials basis. We also offer a number of training classes on implementing, using and administering our service that are billed on a per person, per class basis. Our typical professional services payment terms provide that our customers pay us within 30 days of invoice. In determining whether professional services can be accounted for separately from subscription and support revenues, we consider a number of factors, which are described in Critical Accounting Policies and EstimatesRevenue Recognition below. Prior to February 1, 2011, the deliverables in multiple-deliverable arrangements were accounted for separately if the delivered items had standalone value and there was objective and reliable evidence of fair value for the undelivered items. If the deliverables in a multiple-deliverable arrangement could not be accounted for separately, the total arrangement fee was recognized ratably as a single unit of accounting over the contracted term of the subscription agreement. A significant portion of our multiple-deliverable arrangements were accounted for as a single unit of accounting because we did not have objective and reliable evidence of fair value for certain of our deliverables. Additionally, in these situations, we deferred the direct costs of a related professional service arrangement and amortized those costs over the same period as the professional services revenue was recognized. In October 2009, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2009-13,  Revenue Recognition (Topic 605), Multiple-Deliverable Revenue Arrangementsa consensus of the FASB Emerging Issues Task Force  (ASU 2009-13) which amended the previous multiple-deliverable arrangements accounting guidance. Pursuant to the new guidance, objective and reliable evidence of fair value of the deliverables to be delivered is no longer required in order to account for deliverables in a multiple-deliverable arrangement separately. Instead, arrangement consideration is allocated to deliverables based on their relative selling price. In the first quarter of fiscal 2012, we adopted this new accounting guidance on a prospective basis. We applied the new accounting guidance to those multiple-deliverable arrangements entered into or materially modified on or after February 1, 2011 which was the beginning of our fiscal 2012.  Seasonal Nature of Deferred Revenue and Accounts Receivable Deferred revenue primarily consists of billings to customers for our subscription service. Over 90 percent of the value of our billings to customers is for our subscription and support service. We generally invoice our customers in either annual or quarterly cycles. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012, we introduced greater operational discipline around annual invoicing, for both new business and renewals which resulted in an increase in deferred revenue. The fourth quarter of fiscal 2013 marks the one year anniversary of this operational shift, therefore the incremental benefit to deferred revenue from annual invoicing was lower than it was in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012. Occasionally, we bill customers for their multi-year contract on a single invoice which results in an increase in noncurrent deferred revenue. We typically issue renewal invoices 30 days in advance of the renewal service period, and depending on timing, the initial invoice for the subscription and services contract and the subsequent renewal invoice may occur in different quarters. This may result in an increase in deferred revenue and accounts receivable. There is a disproportionate weighting towards annual billings in the fourth quarter, primarily as a result of large enterprise account buying patterns. Our fourth quarter has historically been our strongest quarter for new business and renewals. The year on year compounding effect of this seasonality in both billing patterns and overall new and renewal business causes the value of invoices that we generate in the fourth quarter for both new business and renewals to increase as a proportion of our total annual billings. Accordingly, the sequential quarterly changes in accounts receivable and the related deferred revenue during the first three quarters of our fiscal year are not necessarily indicative of the billing activity that occurs in the fourth quarter as displayed below: ##TABLE_START (in thousands)  April 30, 2012   July 31, 2012   October 31, 2012   January 31, 2013  Fiscal 2013     Accounts receivable, net  $ 371,395   $ 446,917   $ 418,590   $ 872,634  Deferred revenue, current and noncurrent   1,334,716    1,337,184    1,291,703    1,862,995  (in thousands)  April 30, 2011   July 31, 2011   October 31, 2011   January 31, 2012  Fiscal 2012     Accounts receivable, net  $ 270,816   $ 342,397   $ 312,331   $ 683,745  Deferred revenue, current and noncurrent   915,133    935,266    917,821    1,380,295  (in thousands)  April 30, 2010   July 31, 2010   October 31, 2010   January 31, 2011  Fiscal 2011     Accounts receivable, net  $ 183,612   $ 228,550   $ 258,764   $ 426,943  Deferred revenue, current and noncurrent   664,529    683,019    694,557    934,941  ##TABLE_END Unbilled Deferred Revenue The deferred revenue balance on our consolidated balance sheet does not represent the total contract value of annual or multi-year, non-cancelable subscription agreements. Unbilled deferred revenue represents future billings under our subscription agreements that have not been invoiced and, accordingly, are not recorded in deferred revenue. Unbilled deferred revenue was approximately $3.5 billion as of January 31, 2013 and approximately $2.2 billion as of January 31, 2012. Due to our sales to large enterprise accounts, we are experiencing longer contractual commitments by our customers which is reflected in our growing unbilled deferred revenue. Also as a result, our average contract length has grown and is now between 12 and 36 months. This has a positive impact on our renewal rate. We expect that the amount of unbilled deferred revenue will change from quarter to quarter for several reasons, including the specific timing and duration of large customer subscription agreements, varying billing cycles of subscription agreements, the specific timing of customer renewals, foreign currency fluctuations, the timing of when unbilled deferred revenue is to be recognized as revenue, and changes in customer financial circumstances. For multi-year subscription agreements billed annually, the associated unbilled deferred revenue is typically high at the beginning of the contract period, zero  just prior to renewal, and increases if the agreement is renewed. Low unbilled deferred revenue attributable to a particular subscription agreement is often associated with an impending renewal and may not be an indicator of the likelihood of renewal or future revenue from such customer. Accordingly, we expect that the amount of aggregate unbilled deferred revenue will change from year-to-year depending in part upon the number and dollar amount of subscription agreements at particular stages in their renewal cycle. Such fluctuations are not a reliable indicator of future revenues. Cost of Revenues and Operating Expenses Cost of Revenues. Cost of subscription and support revenues primarily consists of expenses related to hosting our service and providing support, the costs of data center capacity, depreciation or operating lease expense associated with computer equipment and software, allocated overhead and amortization expense associated with capitalized software related to our services and acquired developed technologies. We allocate overhead such as information technology infrastructure, rent and occupancy charges based on headcount. Employee benefit costs and taxes are allocated based upon a percentage of total compensation expense. As such, general overhead expenses are reflected in each cost of revenue and operating expense category. Cost of professional services and other revenues consists primarily of employee-related costs associated with these services, including stock-based expenses, the cost of subcontractors and allocated overhead. The cost of providing professional services is significantly higher as a percentage of the related revenue than for our enterprise cloud computing subscription service due to the direct labor costs and costs of subcontractors. We intend to continue to invest additional resources in our enterprise cloud computing services. For example, we plan to open additional data centers and expand our current data centers in the future. Additionally, as we acquire new businesses and technologies, the amortization expense associated with this activity will be included in cost of revenues. The timing of these additional expenses will affect our cost of revenues, both in terms of absolute dollars and as a percentage of revenues, in the affected periods. Research and Development . Research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries and related expenses, including stock-based expenses, the costs of our development and test data center and allocated overhead. We continue to focus our research and development efforts on adding new features and services, integrating acquired technologies, increasing the functionality and security and enhancing the ease of use of our enterprise cloud computing services. Our proprietary, scalable and secure multi-tenant architecture enables us to provide all of our customers with a service based on a single version of our application. As a result, we do not have to maintain multiple versions, which enables us to have relatively lower research and development expenses as compared to traditional enterprise software companies. We expect that in the future, research and development expenses will increase in absolute dollars and may increase as a percentage of total revenues as we invest in building the necessary employee and system infrastructure required to support the development of new, and improve existing, technologies and the integration of acquired businesses and technologies. Marketing and Sales. Marketing and sales expenses are our largest cost and consist primarily of salaries and related expenses, including stock-based expenses, for our sales and marketing staff, including commissions, payments to partners, marketing programs and allocated overhead. Marketing programs consist of advertising, events, corporate communications, brand building and product marketing activities. We plan to continue to invest in marketing and sales by expanding our domestic and international selling and marketing activities, building brand awareness, attracting new customers and sponsoring additional marketing events. The timing of these marketing events, such as our annual and largest event, Dreamforce, will affect our marketing costs in a particular quarter. We expect that in the future, marketing and sales expenses will increase in absolute dollars and continue to be our largest cost. General and Administrative. General and administrative expenses consist of salaries and related expenses, including stock-based expenses, for finance and accounting, legal, internal audit, human resources and management information systems personnel, legal costs, professional fees, other corporate expenses and allocated overhead. We expect that in the future, general and administrative expenses will increase in absolute  dollars as we invest in our infrastructure and we incur additional employee related costs, professional fees and insurance costs related to the growth of our business and international expansion. We expect general and administrative costs as a percentage of total revenues to either remain flat or decrease for the next several quarters. Stock-Based Expenses. Our cost of revenues and operating expenses include stock-based expenses related to equity plans for employees and non-employee directors. We recognize our stock-based compensation as an expense in the statement of operations based on their fair values and vesting periods. These charges have been significant in the past and we expect that they will increase as our stock price increases, as we hire more employees and seek to retain existing employees. For fiscal 2013, we recognized stock-based expense of $379.4 million. As of January 31, 2013, the aggregate stock compensation remaining to be amortized to costs and expenses was $1.2 billion. We expect this stock compensation balance to be amortized as follows: $491.0 million during fiscal 2014; $394.2 million during fiscal 2015; $249.8 million during fiscal 2016; and $92.5 million during fiscal 2017. The expected amortization reflects only outstanding stock awards as of January 31, 2013 and assumes no forfeiture activity. We expect to continue to issue stock-based awards to our employees in future periods. Amortization of Purchased Intangibles from Business Combinations . Our cost of revenues and operating expenses include amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets, such as the amortization of the cost associated with an acquired companys research and development efforts, trade names, customer lists and customer relationships. We expect this expense to increase as we acquire more companies. Critical Accounting Estimates Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, costs and expenses, and related disclosures. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates and assumptions. Our actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. We believe that of our significant accounting policies, which are described in Note 1 to our consolidated financial statements, the following accounting policies involve a greater degree of judgment and complexity. Accordingly, these are the policies we believe are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our consolidated financial condition and results of operations. Revenue Recognition . We derive our revenues from two sources: (1) subscription revenues, which are comprised of subscription fees from customers accessing our enterprise cloud computing services and from customers purchasing additional support beyond the standard support that is included in the basic subscription fee; and (2) related professional services such as process mapping, project management, implementation services and other revenue. Other revenue consists primarily of training fees. We commence revenue recognition when all of the following conditions are satisfied: ##TABLE_START    There is persuasive evidence of an arrangement; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    The service has been or is being provided to the customer; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    The collection of the fees is reasonably assured; and ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    The amount of fees to be paid by the customer is fixed or determinable. ##TABLE_END Our subscription service arrangements are non-cancelable and do not contain refund-type provisions.  Subscription and Support Revenues Subscription and support revenues are recognized ratably over the contract terms beginning on the commencement date of each contract, which is the date our service is made available to customers. Amounts that have been invoiced are recorded in accounts receivable and in deferred revenue or revenue, depending on whether the revenue recognition criteria have been met. Professional Services and Other Revenues The majority of our professional services contracts are on a time and material basis. When these services are not combined with subscription revenues as a single unit of accounting, as discussed below, these revenues are recognized as the services are rendered for time and material contracts, and when the milestones are achieved and accepted by the customer for fixed price contracts. Training revenues are recognized after the services are performed. Multiple-Deliverable Arrangements We enter into arrangements with multiple-deliverables that generally include subscription, premium support, and professional services. Prior to February 1, 2011, the deliverables in multiple-deliverable arrangements were accounted for separately if the delivered items had standalone value and there was objective and reliable evidence of fair value for the undelivered items. If the deliverables in a multiple-deliverable arrangement could not be accounted for separately, the total arrangement fee was recognized ratably as a single unit of accounting over the contracted term of the subscription agreement. A significant portion of our multiple-deliverable arrangements were accounted for as a single unit of accounting because we did not have objective and reliable evidence of fair value for certain of our deliverables. Additionally, in these situations, we deferred the direct costs of a professional services arrangement and amortized those costs over the same period as the professional services revenue is recognized. In October 2009, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2009-13,  Revenue Recognition (Topic 605), Multiple-Deliverable Revenue Arrangementsa consensus of the FASB Emerging Issues Task Force  (ASU 2009-13) which amended the previous multiple-deliverable arrangements accounting guidance. Pursuant to the updated guidance, objective and reliable evidence of fair value of the deliverables to be delivered is no longer required in order to account for deliverables in a multiple-deliverable arrangement separately. Instead, arrangement consideration is allocated to deliverables based on their relative selling price. In the first quarter of fiscal 2012, we adopted this updated accounting guidance on a prospective basis. We have applied the updated accounting guidance to those multiple-deliverable arrangements entered into or materially modified on or after February 1, 2011 which was the beginning of fiscal 2012. The adoption of this updated accounting guidance did not have a material impact on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2012. As of January 31, 2013, the deferred professional services revenue and deferred costs under the previous accounting guidance are $9.3 million and approximately $3.9 million, respectively, which will continue to be recognized over the related remaining subscription period. Under the updated accounting guidance, in order to treat deliverables in a multiple-deliverable arrangement as separate units of accounting, the deliverables must have standalone value upon delivery. If the deliverables have standalone value upon delivery, we account for each deliverable separately. Subscription services have standalone value as such services are often sold separately. In determining whether professional services have standalone value, we consider the following factors for each professional services agreement: availability of the  services from other vendors, the nature of the professional services, the timing of when the professional services contract was signed in comparison to the subscription service start date, and the contractual dependence of the subscription service on the customers satisfaction with the professional services work. To date, we have concluded that all of the professional services included in multiple-deliverable arrangements executed have standalone value. Under the updated accounting guidance, when multiple-deliverables included in an arrangement are separated into different units of accounting, the arrangement consideration is allocated to the identified separate units based on a relative selling price hierarchy. We determine the relative selling price for a deliverable based on its vendor-specific objective evidence of selling price (VSOE), if available, or our best estimate of selling price (BESP), if VSOE is not available. We have determined that third-party evidence (TPE) is not a practical alternative due to differences in our service offerings compared to other parties and the availability of relevant third-party pricing information. The amount of revenue allocated to delivered items is limited by contingent revenue, if any. For certain professional services, we have established VSOE as a consistent number of standalone sales of this deliverable have been priced within a reasonably narrow range. We have not established VSOE for our subscription services due to lack of pricing consistency, the introduction of new services and other factors. Accordingly, we use our BESP to determine the relative selling price. We determined BESP by considering our overall pricing objectives and market conditions. Significant pricing practices taken into consideration include our discounting practices, the size and volume of our transactions, the customer demographic, the geographic area where our services are sold, our price lists, our go-to-market strategy, historical standalone sales and contract prices. The determination of BESP is made through consultation with and approval by management, taking into consideration the go-to-market strategy. As our go-to-market strategies evolve, we may modify our pricing practices in the future, which could result in changes in relative selling prices, including both VSOE and BESP. Deferred Revenue. The deferred revenue balance does not represent the total contract value of annual or multi-year, non-cancelable subscription agreements. Deferred revenue primarily consists of billings or payments received in advance of revenue recognition from subscription service described above and is recognized as the revenue recognition criteria are met. We generally invoice customers in annual or quarterly installments. Deferred revenue is influenced by several factors, including seasonality, the compounding effects of renewals, invoice duration, invoice timing and new business linearity within the quarter. As a result of the updated accounting guidance previously described, billings against professional services arrangements entered into prior to February 1, 2011 were generally added to deferred revenue and recognized over the remaining related subscription contract term. Deferred revenue that will be recognized during the succeeding twelve month period is recorded as current deferred revenue and the remaining portion is recorded as noncurrent. Deferred Commissions. We defer commission payments to our direct sales force. The commissions are deferred and amortized to sales expense over the non-cancelable terms of the related subscription contracts with our customers, which are typically 12 to 36 months. The commission payments, which are paid in full the month after the customers service commences, are a direct and incremental cost of the revenue arrangements. The deferred commission amounts are recoverable through the future revenue streams under the non-cancelable customer contracts. We believe this is the preferable method of accounting as the commission charges are so closely related to the revenue from the non-cancelable customer contracts that they should be recorded as an asset and charged to expense over the same period that the subscription revenue is recognized.  During fiscal 2013, we deferred $232.6 million of commission expenditures and we amortized $154.8 million to sales expense. During the same period a year ago, we deferred $167.2 million of commission expenditures and we amortized $107.2 million to sales expense. Deferred commissions on our consolidated balance sheets totaled $254.4 million at January 31, 2013 and $176.6 million at January 31, 2012. Goodwill and Long-Lived Assets . We make estimates, assumptions, and judgments when valuing goodwill and other intangible assets in connection with the initial purchase price allocation of an acquired entity, as well as when evaluating the recoverability of our goodwill and other intangible assets on an ongoing basis. These estimates are based upon a number of factors, including historical experience, market conditions, and information obtained from the management of acquired companies. Critical estimates in valuing certain intangible assets include, but are not limited to, historical and projected customer retention rates, anticipated growth in revenue from the acquired customers and acquired technology, and the expected use of the acquired assets. These factors are also considered in determining the useful life of acquired intangible assets. The amounts and useful lives assigned to identified intangible assets impacts the amount and timing of future amortization expense. The value of our goodwill and intangible assets could be impacted by future adverse changes such as, but not limited to: a substantial decline in our market capitalization; an adverse action or assessment by a regulator; and unanticipated competition. We evaluate and test the recoverability of our goodwill for impairment at least annually during the fourth quarter or more often if and when circumstances indicate that goodwill may not be recoverable. Each period we evaluate the estimated remaining useful life of our intangible assets and whether events or changes in circumstances warrant a revision to the remaining period of amortization. We evaluate long-lived assets, such as property and equipment, and purchased intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable. Such events or changes in circumstances include, but are not limited to, a significant decrease in the fair value of the underlying asset, a significant decrease in the benefits realized from the acquired assets, difficulty and delays in integrating the business or a significant change in the operations of the acquired assets or use of an asset. A long-lived asset is considered impaired if its carrying amount exceeds the estimated future undiscounted cash flows the asset is expected to generate. If a long-lived asset is considered to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized is the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset or asset group. Strategic Investments . We report our investments in non-marketable equity and debt securities, which consist of minority equity and debt investments in privately-held companies, at cost or fair value when an event or circumstance indicates an other-than-temporary decline in value has occurred. Management evaluates financial results, earnings trends, technology milestones and subsequent financing of these companies, as well as the general market conditions to identify indicators of other-than-temporary impairment. Business Combinations. Accounting for business combinations requires us to make significant estimates and assumptions, especially at the acquisition date with respect to tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed and pre-acquisition contingencies. We use our best estimates and assumptions to accurately assign fair value to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date. Examples of critical estimates in valuing certain of the intangible assets and goodwill we have acquired include but are not limited to: ##TABLE_START    future expected cash flows from subscription and support contracts, professional services contracts, other customer contracts and acquired developed technologies and patents; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    expected costs to develop the in-process research and development into commercially viable products and estimated cash flows from the projects when completed; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    the acquired companys trade name, trademark and existing customer relationship, as well as assumptions about the period of time the acquired trade name and trademark will continue to be used in our offerings; ##TABLE_END  ##TABLE_START    uncertain tax positions and tax related valuation allowances assumed; and ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    discount rates. ##TABLE_END Unanticipated events and circumstances may occur that may affect the accuracy or validity of such assumptions, estimates or actual results. Stock-Based Options and Awards. We recognize the fair value of our stock options and awards on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period of the option or award which is the vesting term of generally four years for stock options and restricted stock awards and one year for shares issued pursuant to our Employee Stock Purchase Plan (ESPP). The fair value of each option or award is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. The estimated forfeiture rate applied is based on historical forfeiture rates. Inputs into the Black-Scholes option pricing model include: ##TABLE_START    The estimated life for the stock options which is estimated based on an actual analysis of expected life. The estimated life for shares issued pursuant to our ESPP is based on the two purchase periods within the 12 month offering period; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    The risk free interest rate which is based on the rate for a U.S. government security with the same estimated life at the time of the option grant and the stock purchase rights; and ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    The future stock price volatility which is estimated considering both our observed option-implied volatilities and our historical volatility calculations. We believe this is the best estimate of the expected volatility over the expected life of our stock options and stock purchase rights. ##TABLE_END Income Taxes. We use the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on temporary differences between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in the consolidated statements of operations in the period that includes the enactment date. Our tax positions are subject to income tax audits by multiple tax jurisdictions throughout the world. We recognize the tax benefit of an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the position is sustainable upon examination by the taxing authority, based on the technical merits. The tax benefit recognized is measured as the largest amount of benefit which is greater than 50 percent likely to be realized upon settlement with the taxing authority. We recognize interest accrued and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in our income tax provision. We regularly assess the need for a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets. In making that assessment, we consider both positive and negative evidence related to the likelihood of realization of the deferred tax assets on a jurisdictional basis to determine, based on the weight of available evidence, whether it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. Examples of positive and negative evidence include historical taxable income or losses, forecasted income or losses, the estimated timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences as well as prudent and feasible tax planning strategies. Valuation allowance is established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amounts more likely than not expected to be realized. Our income tax provision would increase or decrease in the period in which the assessment is changed. Our tax provision could be adversely affected by changes in the mix of earnings and losses in countries with differing statutory tax rates, certain non-deductible expenses, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, changes in tax laws and accounting principles as well as changes in excess tax benefits related to exercises and vesting of stock-based compensation that are allocated directly to stockholders equity.

Subscription and support revenues were $2.9 billion, or 94 percent of total revenues, for fiscal 2013, compared to $2.1 billion, or 94 percent of total revenues, during the same period a year ago. The increase in subscription and support revenues was due primarily to new customers, upgrades and additional subscriptions from existing customers and improved renewal rates as compared to a year ago. During fiscal 2013, we continued to invest in a variety of customer programs and initiatives which, along with longer contract durations and increasing enterprise adoption, have helped improve our renewal rates. The price per user per month for our three primary offerings, Professional Edition, Enterprise Edition and Unlimited Edition, in fiscal 2013 has generally remained consistent relative to prior periods. Professional services and other revenues were $181.4 million, or six percent of total revenues, for fiscal 2013, compared to $140.3 million, or six percent of total revenues, for the same period a year ago. The increase in professional services and other revenues was due primarily to the higher demand for services from an increased number of customers. Revenues in Europe and Asia Pacific accounted for $926.5 million, or 30 percent of total revenues, for fiscal 2013, compared to $726.3 million, or 32 percent of total revenues, during the same period a year ago, an increase of $200.2 million, or 28 percent. The increase in revenues outside of the Americas was the result of the increasing acceptance of our service, our focus on marketing our services internationally and improved renewal rates as a result of the reasons stated above. Revenues outside of the Americas increased despite an overall strengthening of the U.S. dollar relative to major international currencies, which reduced aggregate international revenues by $43.9 million compared to the same period a year ago.

The increase in absolute dollars was primarily due to an increase of $77.5 million in employee-related costs, an increase of $16.3 million in stock-based expenses, an increase of $36.2 million in service delivery costs, primarily due to our efforts to increase data center capacity, an increase of $37.5 million in depreciation and amortization expenses, $17.2 million of which related to the amortization of purchased intangible assets and an increase of $14.6 million in allocated overhead. We have increased our headcount by 32 percent since January 31, 2012 to meet the higher demand for services from our customers. Some of the increase in headcount was due to acquired businesses. We intend to continue to invest additional resources in our enterprise cloud computing services and data center capacity. Additionally, the amortization of purchased intangible assets will increase as we acquire additional businesses and technologies. We also plan to add additional employees in our professional services group to facilitate the adoption of our services. The timing of these expenses will affect our cost of revenues, both in terms of absolute dollars and as a percentage of revenues in future periods. Research and Development. ##TABLE_START   Fiscal Year Ended January 31,   Variance Dollars  (In thousands)  2013   2012   Research and development  $ 429,479   $ 295,347   $ 134,132  Percent of total revenues   14 %   13 %  ##TABLE_END Research and development expenses were $429.5 million, or 14 percent of total revenues, during fiscal 2013, compared to $295.3 million, or 13 percent of total revenues, during the same period a year ago, an increase of $134.1 million. The increase in absolute dollars was primarily due to an increase of $92.6 million in employee-related costs, an increase of $30.4 million in stock-based expenses and an increase of $8.8 million in our development and test data center. We increased our research and development headcount by 36 percent since January 31, 2012 in order to improve and extend our service offerings and develop new technologies. Some of the increase in headcount was due to acquired businesses. We expect that research and development expenses will increase in absolute dollars and may increase as a percentage of revenues in fiscal 2014 and future periods because we expect to continue to invest in building the necessary employee and system infrastructure required to support the development of new, and improve existing, technologies and the integration of acquired technologies.

The increase in absolute dollars was primarily due to increases of $305.9 million in employee-related costs, including amortization of deferred commissions, $83.6 million in stock-based expenses, $29.3 million in advertising, marketing and event costs and $23.7 million in allocated overhead. Our marketing and sales headcount increased by 25 percent since January 31, 2012 as we hired additional sales personnel to focus on adding new customers and increasing penetration within our existing customer base. Some of the increase in headcount was due to acquired businesses. General and Administrative. ##TABLE_START   Fiscal Year Ended January 31,   Variance Dollars  (In thousands)  2013   2012   General and administrative  $ 433,821   $ 347,781   $ 86,040  Percent of total revenues   15 %   15 %  ##TABLE_END General and administrative expenses were $433.8 million, or 15 percent of total revenues, during fiscal 2013, compared to $347.8 million, or 15 percent of total revenues, during the same period a year ago, an increase of $86.0 million. The increase was primarily due to an increase of $56.2 million in employee-related costs and an increase of $19.8 million in stock-based expenses. Our general and administrative headcount increased by 15 percent since January 31, 2012 as we added personnel to support our growth. Loss from operations. ##TABLE_START   Fiscal Year Ended January 31,   Variance Dollars  (In thousands)  2013   2012   Loss from operations  $ (110,710 )  $ (35,085 )  $ (75,625 ) Percent of total revenues   (4 )%   (2 )%  ##TABLE_END Loss from operations during fiscal 2013 was $110.7 million and included $379.4 million of stock-based expenses and $88.2 million of amortization of purchased intangibles. During the same period a year ago, loss from operations was $35.1 million and included $229.3 million of stock-based expenses and $67.3 million of amortization of purchased intangibles. Investment income. ##TABLE_START   Fiscal Year Ended January 31,   Variance Dollars  (In thousands)  2013   2012   Investment income  $ 19,562   $ 23,268   $ (3,706 ) Percent of total revenues   1 %   1 %  ##TABLE_END  Investment income consists of income on our cash and marketable securities balances. Investment income was $19.6 million during fiscal 2013 and was $23.3 million during the same period a year ago. The decrease was primarily due to lower yields and interest rates on our portfolio compared to the same period a year ago. Interest expense. ##TABLE_START   Fiscal Year Ended January 31,   Variance Dollars  (In thousands)  2013   2012   Interest expense  $ (30,948 )  $ (17,045 )  $ (13,903 ) Percent of total revenues   (1 )%   (1 )%  ##TABLE_END Interest expense consists of interest on our convertible senior notes and capital leases. Interest expense, net of interest costs capitalized, was $30.9 million during fiscal 2013 and was $17.0 million during the same period a year ago. During fiscal 2013, we capitalized $2.4 million of interest costs related to capital projects. Capitalized interest during the same period a year ago was $14.6 million. During the first quarter of fiscal 2013, we suspended pre-construction activity, which includes capitalized interest costs, on the undeveloped real estate in San Francisco, California resulting in an increase in interest expense as compared to the same period a year ago. Benefit from (provision for) income taxes. ##TABLE_START   Fiscal Year Ended January 31,   Variance Dollars  (In thousands)  2013   2012   Benefit from (provision for) income taxes  $ (142,651 )  $ 21,745   $ (164,396 ) Effective tax rate   (112 )%   65 %  ##TABLE_END We recorded a tax provision of $142.7 million during fiscal 2013, which resulted in a negative effective tax rate of 112 percent. The effective tax rate substantially differed from the federal statutory tax rate of 35 percent primarily due to the tax charge of $186.8 million to establish a valuation allowance for a significant portion of our deferred tax assets. We regularly assess the need for a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets by considering both positive and negative evidence related to the likelihood of the realization of the deferred tax assets to determine if it is more-likely-than-not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will be realized. In our evaluation, we considered our cumulative loss in recent years and our forecasted future losses as significant pieces of negative evidence. During fiscal 2013, we determined that the negative evidence outweighed the positive evidence and a valuation allowance for a significant portion of our deferred tax assets was established that resulted in a tax expense of $186.8 million. We will continue to assess the realizability of the deferred tax assets in each of the applicable jurisdictions going forward and adjust the valuation allowance accordingly. Due to the valuation allowance, the effective tax rate could be volatile and is therefore difficult to forecast in future periods. See Note 8 Income Taxes to the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for our reconciliation of income taxes at the statutory federal rate to the provision for income taxes. We recorded a tax benefit of $21.7 million during fiscal 2012, which resulted in an effective tax rate of 65 percent. The effective tax rate was higher than the federal statutory tax rate of 35 percent primarily due to federal and California tax credits and the impact of the Radian6 acquisition. The combined effect of these tax benefits was partially offset by foreign tax expense and non-deductible amounts. The effect on the tax rate was magnified because of the relatively small pre-tax loss.  We also receive certain tax incentives in Switzerland and Singapore in the form of reduced tax rates. These temporary tax reduction programs will expire in 2016 and 2014, respectively. The Singapore program, however, is eligible for renewal. Fiscal Years Ended January 31, 2012 and 2011 Revenues. ##TABLE_START   Fiscal Year Ended January 31,   Variance  (In thousands)  2012   2011   Dollars   Percent  Subscription and support  $ 2,126,234   $ 1,551,145   $ 575,089    37 % Professional services and other   140,305    105,994    34,311    32 %         Total revenues  $ 2,266,539   $ 1,657,139   $ 609,400    37 %         ##TABLE_END Total revenues were $2.3 billion for fiscal 2012, compared to $1.7 billion during fiscal 2011, an increase of $609.4 million, or 37 percent. Subscription and support revenues were $2.1 billion, or 94 percent of total revenues, for fiscal 2012, compared to $1.6 billion, or 94 percent of total revenues, during fiscal 2011. The increase in subscription and support revenues was due primarily to new customers, upgrades and additional subscriptions from existing customers and improved renewal rates as compared to fiscal 2011. The price per user per month for our three primary offerings, Professional Edition, Enterprise Edition and Unlimited Edition, in fiscal 2012 has generally remained consistent relative to fiscal 2011. Professional services and other revenues were $140.3 million, or six percent of total revenues, for fiscal 2012, compared to $106.0 million, or six percent of total revenues, for fiscal 2011. The increase in professional services and other revenues was due primarily to the improved utilization of existing headcount and a benefit from the prospective adoption of the new revenue accounting guidance for multiple-deliverable arrangements. Revenues in Europe and Asia Pacific accounted for $726.3 million, or 32 percent of total revenues, for fiscal 2012, compared to $522.1 million, or 32 percent of total revenues, during fiscal 2011, an increase of $204.1 million, or 39 percent. The increase in revenues outside of the Americas was the result of the increasing acceptance of our service, our focus on marketing our services internationally and improved renewal rates. Additionally, the value of the U.S. dollar relative to foreign currencies contributed to a slight increase in U.S. dollar revenues outside of the Americas for fiscal 2012 as compared to fiscal 2011. The foreign currency impact had the effect of increasing our aggregate revenues by $36.9 million compared to fiscal 2011.

The increase in absolute dollars was primarily due to an increase of $20.4 million in employee-related costs, an increase of $5.3 million in stock based expenses, an increase of $39.8 million in service delivery costs, primarily due to our efforts to increase data center capacity, an increase of $68.3 million in depreciation and amortization expenses, $44.6 million of which related to the amortization of purchased intangible assets, an increase of $24.2 million in  outside subcontractor and other service costs, and an increase of $5.5 million in allocated overhead. Gross profit margins for professional services and other revenues improved during fiscal 2012 primarily due to the improved utilization of existing headcount and a benefit from the prospective adoption of the new revenue accounting guidance for multiple-deliverable arrangements.

The increase in absolute dollars was primarily due to an increase of $66.7 million in employee-related costs, an increase of $27.0 million in stock-based expenses, an increase of $2.2 million in our development and test data center, an increase of $1.4 million in depreciation and amortization expenses and an increase of $8.6 million in allocated overhead. We increased our research and development headcount by 52 percent in fiscal 2012 in order to improve and extend our service offerings and develop new technologies. Some of the increase in headcount was due to acquired businesses. Marketing and Sales. ##TABLE_START   Fiscal Year Ended January 31,   Variance Dollars  (In thousands)  2012   2011   Marketing and sales  $ 1,169,610   $ 792,029   $ 377,581  Percent of total revenues   52 %   48 %  ##TABLE_END Marketing and sales expenses were $1,169.6 million, or 52 percent of total revenues, during fiscal 2012, compared to $792.0 million, or 48 percent of total revenues, during fiscal 2011, an increase of $377.6 million. The increase in absolute dollars was primarily due to increases of $255.6 million in employee-related costs, $59.3 million in stock-based expenses, $22.5 million in advertising, marketing and event costs, $21.8 million in allocated overhead, $8.2 million in outside subcontractor and other service costs, $3.1 million in depreciation and amortization and the preliminary settlement of the California wage and hour case. Our marketing and sales headcount increased by 44 percent in fiscal 2012 as we hired additional sales personnel to focus on adding new customers and increasing penetration within our existing customer base. Some of the increase in headcount was due to acquired businesses.

The increase was primarily due to increases of $57.5 million in employee-related costs, $17.3 million in stock-based expenses and $14.3 million in professional and outside service costs. Our general and administrative headcount increased by 46 percent in fiscal 2012 as we added personnel to support our growth.

Investment income was $23.3 million during fiscal 2012 and was $37.7 million during fiscal 2011. The decrease was primarily due to a reduction in realized gains from sales of marketable securities, the decrease in marketable securities balances and lower interest rates. Interest expense. ##TABLE_START   Fiscal Year Ended January 31,   Variance Dollars  (In thousands)  2012   2011   Interest expense  $ (17,045 )  $ (24,909 )  $ 7,864  Percent of total revenues   (1 )%   (2 )%  ##TABLE_END Interest expense consists of interest on our convertible senior notes and capital leases. Interest expense was $17.0 million, net of interest costs capitalized, during fiscal 2012 and was $24.9 million during fiscal 2011. During fiscal 2012, we capitalized $14.6 million of interest costs related to capital projects, specifically costs related to our real estate holdings, which began during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011, and our capitalized internal-use software development costs. Capitalized interest during fiscal 2011 was $4.0 million. Other expense. ##TABLE_START   Fiscal Year Ended January 31,   Variance Dollars  (In thousands)  2012   2011   Other expense  $ (4,455 )  $ (6,025 )  $ 1,570  ##TABLE_END Other expense primarily consists of realized gains and losses resulting from strategic investment activity and foreign currency transaction gains and losses. Other expense decreased primarily due to the net gain of $2.9 million from activity within our portfolio of noncontrolling equity and debt investments in privately-held companies offset by realized and unrealized losses on foreign currency transactions for fiscal 2012 compared to fiscal 2011.  Benefit from (provision for) income taxes. ##TABLE_START   Fiscal Year Ended January 31,   Variance Dollars  (In thousands)  2012   2011   Benefit (provision) for income taxes  $ 21,745   $ (34,601 )  $ 56,346  Effective tax rate   65 %   33 %  ##TABLE_END The benefit for income taxes was $21.7 million during fiscal 2012, compared to an income tax provision of $34.6 million during fiscal 2011. Our effective tax rate was 65 percent for fiscal 2012 compared to 33 percent for fiscal 2011. The higher tax rate was primarily attributable to an increase in federal and California tax credits and a tax benefit related to the May 2011 acquisition of Radian6. The combined effect of these tax benefits was partially offset by an increase in the foreign tax rate differential. Foreign tax expense relative to our fiscal 2012 pre-tax loss was higher as compared to foreign tax expense relative to our fiscal 2011 pre-tax income. The combined effect of these items on a small net loss before income taxes resulted in a comparatively higher fiscal 2012 effective tax rate. The lower fiscal 2012 state tax rate was primarily attributable to two items. First, California enacted several income tax law changes, which generally benefited California-based companies. The result of this tax law change substantially reduced our state effective tax rate. Second, the Company was subject to minimum state taxes, which reduced the state tax benefit. The combined effect of these tax items was an overall small fiscal 2012 state tax benefit. Note that we separately recorded an income tax expense of $2.2 million in fiscal 2011 to re-value the anticipated future tax effects of our California temporary differences related to this tax law change. We also receive certain tax incentives in Switzerland and Singapore in the form of reduced tax rates. These temporary tax reduction programs will expire in 2016 and 2014, respectively. The Singapore program, however, is eligible for renewal. New Accounting Pronouncement In July 2012, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2012-02, IntangiblesGoodwill and Other (Topic 350)Testing Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets for Impairment (ASU 2012-02), to allow entities to use a qualitative approach to test indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment. ASU 2012-02 permits an entity to first perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of an indefinite-lived intangible asset is less than its carrying value. If it is concluded that this is the case, it is necessary to perform the currently prescribed quantitative impairment test by comparing the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset with its carrying value. Otherwise, the quantitative impairment test is not required. We plan to adopt ASU 2012-02 in fiscal 2014 and do not believe that the adoption will have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements. Liquidity and Capital Resources At January 31, 2013, our principal sources of liquidity were cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaling $1.8 billion and accounts receivable of $872.6 million. Net cash provided by operating activities was $736.9 million during fiscal 2013 and $591.5 million during the same period a year ago. Cash provided by operating activities has historically been affected by: the amount of net loss adjusted for non-cash expense items such as depreciation and amortization, amortization of purchased intangibles from business combinations, amortization of debt discount, and the expense associated with stock-based awards; the reclassification of excess tax benefits from employee stock plans to cash flows from financing activities; the timing of employee related costs including commissions and bonus payments; the timing of collections from our customers, which is our largest source of operating cash flows; and changes in working capital accounts.  Our working capital accounts consist of accounts receivables and prepaid assets and other current assets. Claims against working capital include accounts payable, accrued expenses and other current liabilities and our convertible notes. Our working capital may be impacted by factors in future periods, certain amounts and timing of which are seasonal, such as billings to customers for subscriptions and support services and the subsequent collection of those billings. As described above in Seasonal Nature of Deferred Revenue and Accounts Receivable, our fourth quarter has historically been our strongest quarter for new business and renewals. The year on year compounding effect of this seasonality in both billing patterns and overall business causes the value of invoices that we generate in the fourth quarter to increase as a proportion of our total annual billings. Additionally, due to continually increased annual cycle billing patterns, the value of customer billings during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013 contributed to a higher accounts receivable and deferred revenue balances as of January 31, 2013 than as of January 31, 2012. We generally invoice our customers for our subscription and services contracts in advance in annual or quarterly installments. We typically issue renewal invoices 30 days in advance of the renewal service period, and depending on timing, the initial invoice for the subscription and services contract and the subsequent renewal invoice may occur in different quarters. Such invoice amounts are initially reflected in accounts receivable and deferred revenue, which is reflected on the balance sheet. The operating cash flow benefit of increased billing activity generally occurs in the subsequent quarter when we collect from our customers. In fiscal 2013, net cash provided by operating activities increased $145.4 million over the same period a year ago primarily due to higher net income after adjusting for depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation, and changes in working capital accounts which include the establishment of the tax valuation allowance during the year. Net cash used in investing activities was $938.9 million during fiscal 2013 and $489.7 million during the same period a year ago. The net cash used in investing activities during fiscal 2013 primarily related to the purchase of Rypple, Inc. (Rypple) in February 2012, the purchase of Buddy in August 2012, the purchase of GoInstant, Inc. (GoInstant) in September 2012, capital expenditures, investment of cash balances and strategic investments offset by proceeds from sales and maturities of marketable securities. Net cash provided by financing activities was $334.5 million during fiscal 2013 and $75.9 million during the same period a year ago. Net cash provided by financing activities during fiscal 2013 consisted primarily of $351.4 million of proceeds from equity plans and $14.9 million of excess tax benefits from employee stock plans offset by $31.8 million of principal payments on capital leases. In January 2010, we issued $575.0 million of 0.75% convertible senior notes due January 15, 2015 (the Notes) and concurrently entered into convertible notes hedges (the Note Hedges) and separate warrant transactions (the Warrants). The Notes will mature on January 15, 2015, unless earlier converted. Upon conversion of any Notes, we will deliver cash up to the principal amount of the Notes and, with respect to any excess conversion value greater than the principal amount of the Notes, shares of our common stock, cash, or a combination of both. To date, there has been a nominal amount of conversions. For 20 trading days during the 30 consecutive trading days ended October 31, 2012, our common stock traded at a price exceeding 130% of the conversion price of $85.36 per share applicable to the Notes. Accordingly, the Notes were convertible at the holders option for the quarter ending January 31, 2013. The Notes are classified as a current liability on our consolidated balance sheet as of January 31, 2013. For 20 trading days during the 30 consecutive trading days ended January 31, 2013, our common stock traded at a price exceeding 130% of the conversion price of $85.36 per share applicable to the Notes. Accordingly, the Notes will be convertible at the holders option for the quarter ending April 30, 2013, and will remain classified as a current liability on our consolidated balance sheet.  Our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities are comprised primarily of corporate notes and other obligations, U.S. treasury securities, U.S. agency obligations, government obligations, collateralized mortgage obligations, mortgage backed securities, time deposits, money market mutual funds and municipal securities. As of January 31, 2013, we have a total of $60.8 million in letters of credit outstanding in favor of certain landlords for office space. To date, no amounts have been drawn against the letters of credit, which renew annually and mature at various dates through December 2030. We do not have any special purpose entities, and other than operating leases for office space and computer equipment, we do not engage in off-balance sheet financing arrangements. Additionally, we currently do not have a bank line of credit. Our principal commitments consist of obligations under leases for office space and co-location facilities for data center capacity and our development and test data center, and computer equipment and furniture and fixtures. At January 31, 2013, the future non-cancelable minimum payments under these commitments were as follows (in thousands): ##TABLE_START (In thousands) Contractual Obligations  Payments Due by Period   Total   Less than 1 Year   1-3 Years   3-5 Years   More than 5 Years  Capital lease obligations  $ 66,853   $ 31,694   $ 22,400   $ 12,759   $ 0  Operating lease obligations:      Facilities space   1,505,059    108,301    233,378    250,428    912,952  Computer equipment and furniture and fixtures   81,356    43,046    38,310    0    0  Convertible Senior Notes, including interest   583,626    4,313    579,313    0    0  Contractual commitments   7,072    3,472    3,600    0    0            Total  $ 2,243,966   $ 190,826   $ 877,001   $ 263,187   $ 912,952            ##TABLE_END The majority of our operating lease agreements provide us with the option to renew. Our future operating lease obligations would change if we exercised these options and if we entered into additional operating lease agreements as we expand our operations. Purchase orders are not included in the table above. Our purchase orders represent authorizations to purchase rather than binding agreements. The contractual commitment amounts in the table above are associated with agreements that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms, including: fixed or minimum services to be used; fixed, minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. Obligations under contracts that we can cancel without a significant penalty are not included in the table above. During fiscal 2014 and future fiscal years, we expect to make additional investments in our infrastructure to scale our operations and increase productivity. We plan to upgrade and/or replace various internal systems to scale with the overall growth of the Company. Additionally, we expect capital expenditures to be higher in absolute dollars in fiscal 2014 than in fiscal 2013 as a result of continued office build-outs, other leasehold improvements and data center investments. In the future, we may enter into arrangements to acquire or invest in complementary businesses or joint ventures, services and technologies, and intellectual property rights. We may be required to seek additional equity or debt financing. Additional funds may not be available on terms favorable to us or at all. We believe our existing cash, cash equivalents and short-term marketable securities and cash provided by operating activities will be sufficient to meet our working capital and capital expenditure needs over the next 12 months.  Non-GAAP Financial Measures Regulation S-K Item 10(e), Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures in Commission Filings, defines and prescribes the conditions for use of non-GAAP financial information. Our measures of non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP operating profit, non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP earnings per share each meet the definition of a non-GAAP financial measure. Non-GAAP gross profit, Non-GAAP operating profit and Non-GAAP net income We use the non-GAAP measures of non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP operating profit and non-GAAP net income to provide an additional view of operational performance by excluding non-cash expenses that are not directly related to performance in any particular period. In addition to our GAAP measures we use these non-GAAP measures when planning, monitoring, and evaluating our performance. We believe that these non-GAAP measures reflect our ongoing business in a manner that allows for meaningful period-to-period comparisons and analysis of trends in our business, as they exclude certain expenses. These certain expenses are excluded because the decisions which gave rise to these expenses are not made to increase revenue in a particular period, but are made for our long-term benefit over multiple periods and we are not able to change or affect these items in any particular period. We define non-GAAP net income as our total net income excluding the following components, which we believe are not reflective of our ongoing operational expenses. In each case, for the reasons set forth below, we believe that excluding the component provides useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating the impact of certain non-cash items to our operating results and future prospects in the same manner as us, in comparing financial results across accounting periods and to those of peer companies and to better understand the impact of these non-cash items on our gross margin and operating performance. Additionally, as significant, unusual or discrete events occur, the results may be excluded in the period in which the events occur. ##TABLE_START    Stock-Based Expenses . The Companys compensation strategy includes the use of stock-based compensation to attract and retain employees and executives. It is principally aimed at aligning their interests with those of our stockholders and at long-term employee retention, rather than to motivate or reward operational performance for any particular period. Thus, stock-based compensation expense varies for reasons that are generally unrelated to operational decisions and performance in any particular period. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    Amortization of Purchased Intangibles. The Company views amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets, such as the amortization of the cost associated with an acquired companys research and development efforts, trade names, customer lists and customer relationships, as items arising from pre-acquisition activities determined at the time of an acquisition. While it is continually viewed for impairment, amortization of the cost of purchased intangibles is a static expense, one that is not typically affected by operations during any particular period. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    Amortization of Debt Discount. Under GAAP, certain convertible debt instruments that may be settled in cash (or other assets) on conversion are required to be separately accounted for as liability (debt) and equity (conversion option) components of the instrument in a manner that reflects the issuers non-convertible debt borrowing rate. Accordingly, for GAAP purposes we are required to recognize imputed interest expense on the Companys $575 million of convertible senior notes that were issued in a private placement in January 2010. The imputed interest rate is approximately 5.9%, while the coupon interest rate is 0.75%. The difference between the imputed interest expense and the coupon interest expense, net of the interest amount capitalized, is excluded from managements assessment of the Companys operating performance because management believes that this non-cash expense is not indicative of ongoing operating performance. Management believes that the exclusion of the non-cash interest expense provides investors an enhanced view of the Companys operational performance. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    One-time Tax Charge . As a result of the Company assessing the realizability of its deferred tax assets, in the third quarter of fiscal 2013 the Company recorded a one-time, non-cash charge to income tax ##TABLE_END  ##TABLE_START  expense to establish a valuation allowance against a significant portion of those assets. The Company applied significant judgment as part of this analysis including considering the Companys past operating results, cumulative losses and forecasts of future taxable income. As part of establishing a valuation allowance with respect to the companys deferred tax assets, the company will assess and record any necessary quarterly changes to the valuation allowance and the corresponding income tax expense or benefit. Management believes that the exclusion of this non-cash charge is appropriate to provide investors with a better view of the companys operational performance. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    Income Tax Effects and Adjustments . The Companys non-GAAP tax provision excludes the tax effects of expense items described above and certain tax items not directly related to the current fiscal years ordinary operating results. Examples of such tax items include, but are not limited to, changes in the valuation allowance related to deferred tax assets, certain acquisition-related costs and unusual or infrequently occurring items. Management believes the exclusion of these income tax adjustments provides investors with useful supplemental information about the Companys operational performance ##TABLE_END We define non-GAAP gross profit as our total revenues less cost of revenues, as reported on our consolidated statement of operations, excluding the portions of stock-based expenses and amortization of purchased intangibles that are included in cost of revenues. We define non-GAAP operating profit as our non-GAAP gross profit less operating expenses, as reported on our consolidated statement of operations, excluding the portions of stock-based expenses and amortization of purchased intangibles that are included in operating expenses. Non-GAAP earnings per share Management uses the non-GAAP earnings per share to provide an additional view of performance by excluding expenses that are not directly related to performance in any particular period in the earnings per share calculation. We define non-GAAP earnings per share as our non-GAAP net income, which excludes the above components, which we believe are not reflective of our ongoing operational expenses, divided by basic or diluted shares outstanding. Limitations on the use of Non-GAAP financial measures A limitation of our non-GAAP financial measures of non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP operating profit, non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP earnings per share is that they do not have uniform definitions. Our definitions will likely differ from the definitions used by other companies, including peer companies, and therefore comparability may be limited. Thus, our non-GAAP measures of non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP operating profit, non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP earnings per share should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, or in isolation from, measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. Additionally, in the case of stock-based expense, if we did not pay a portion of compensation in the form of stock-based expense, the cash salary expense included in costs of revenues and operating expenses would be higher which would affect our cash position. We compensate for these limitations by reconciling non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP operating profit, non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP earnings per share to the most comparable GAAP financial measure. We encourage investors and others to review our financial information in its entirety, not to rely on any single financial measure and to view our non-GAAP financial measures in conjunction with the most comparable GAAP financial measures.   Our reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measure of gross profit, operating profit, net income and earnings per share to the most comparable GAAP measure, gross profit, income (loss) from operations, net income (loss) and Diluted earnings (loss) per share for the years ended January 31, 2013, 2012, and 2011 are as follows (in thousands): ##TABLE_START   For the Year Ended January 31,  Non-GAAP gross profit  2013   2012   2011  GAAP gross profit  $ 2,366,616   $ 1,777,653   $ 1,333,326  Plus:    Amortization of purchased intangibles   77,249    60,069    15,459  Stock-based expenses   33,757    17,451    12,158        Non-GAAP gross profit  $ 2,477,622   $ 1,855,173   $ 1,360,943        ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START   For the Year Ended January 31,  Non-GAAP operating profit  2013   2012   2011  GAAP income (loss) from operations  $ (110,710 )  $ (35,085 )  $ 97,497  Plus:    Amortization of purchased intangibles   88,171    67,319    19,668  Stock-based expenses   379,350    229,258    120,429        Non-GAAP income from operations  $ 356,811   $ 261,492   $ 237,594        ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START   For the Year Ended January 31,  Non-GAAP net income attributable to salesforce.com  2013   2012   2011  GAAP net income (loss) attributable to salesforce.com  $ (270,445 )  $ (11,572 )  $ 64,474  Plus:    Amortization of purchased intangibles   88,171    67,319   $ 19,668  Stock-based expenses   379,350    229,258    120,429  Amortization of debt discount, net   23,837    12,335    19,079  One-time tax items   149,147    0    0  Less:    Income tax effect of Non-GAAP items   (127,518 )   (103,730 )   (57,544 )       Non-GAAP net income attributable to salesforce.com  $ 242,542   $ 193,610   $ 166,106        ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START   For the Year Ended January 31,  Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share(a)  2013   2012   2011  GAAP diluted earnings (loss) per share  $ (1.92 )  $ (0.09 )  $ 0.47  Plus:    Amortization of purchased intangibles   0.59    0.47    0.14  Stock-based expenses   2.54    1.62    0.88  Amortization of debt discount, net   0.16    0.09    0.14  One-time tax items   1.00    0.00    0.00  Less:    Income tax effect of Non-GAAP items   (0.74 )   (0.73 )   (0.41 )       Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share attributable to salesforce.com  $ 1.63   $ 1.36   $ 1.22        Shares used in computing diluted net income per share   149,070    142,295    136,598  ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START (a) Reported GAAP loss per share was calculated using the basic share count.

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK ##TABLE_END Foreign currency exchange risk Our results of operations and cash flows are subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates, particularly changes in the Euro, British Pound Sterling, Canadian dollar and Japanese Yen. We seek to minimize the impact of certain foreign currency fluctuations by hedging certain balance sheet exposures with foreign currency forward contracts. Any gain or loss from settling these contracts is offset by the loss or gain derived from the underlying balance sheet exposures. In accordance with our policy, the hedging contracts we enter into have maturities of less than three months. Additionally, by policy, we do not enter into any hedging contracts for trading or speculative purposes. Interest rate sensitivity We had cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaling $1.8 billion at January 31, 2013. This amount was invested primarily in money market funds, time deposits, corporate notes and bonds, government securities and other debt securities with credit ratings of at least single A or better. The cash, cash equivalents and short-term marketable securities are held for working capital purposes. Our investments are made for capital preservation purposes. We do not enter into investments for trading or speculative purposes. Our cash equivalents and our portfolio of marketable securities are subject to market risk due to changes in interest rates. Fixed rate securities may have their market value adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates, while floating rate securities may produce less income than expected if interest rates fall. Due in part to these factors, our future investment income may fall short of expectation due to changes in interest rates or we may suffer losses in principal if we are forced to sell securities that decline in market value due to changes in interest rates. However because we classify our debt securities as available for sale, no gains or losses are recognized due to changes in interest rates unless such securities are sold prior to maturity or declines in fair value are determined to be other-than-temporary. Our fixed-income portfolio is subject to interest rate risk. An immediate increase or decrease in interest rates of 100-basis points at January 31, 2013 could result in a $16.7 million market value reduction or increase of the same amount. This estimate is based on a sensitivity model that measures market value changes when changes in interest rates occur. Fluctuations in the value of our investment securities caused by a change in interest rates (gains or losses on the carrying value) are recorded in other comprehensive income, and are realized only if we sell the underlying securities.  At January 31, 2012, we had cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaling $1.4 billion. The fixed-income portfolio was also subject to interest rate risk. Changes in interest rates of 100-basis points would have resulted in market value changes of $12.1 million. Market Risk and Market Interest Risk In January 2010, we issued at par value $575.0 million of 0.75% convertible senior notes due 2015 (the Notes). Holders may convert their Notes prior to maturity upon the occurrence of certain circumstances. Upon conversion, we would pay the holder an amount of cash equal to the principal amount of the Notes. Amounts in excess of the principal amount, if any, may be paid in cash or stock at our option. Concurrent with the issuance of the Notes, we entered into separate note hedging transactions and the sale of warrants. These separate transactions were completed to reduce the potential economic dilution from the conversion of the Notes. For the three months ended January 31, 2013 the Notes were convertible at the option of the noteholder. For 20 trading days during the 30 consecutive trading days ended January 31, 2013, our common stock traded at a price exceeding 130% of the conversion price of $85.36 per share applicable to the Notes. Accordingly, the Notes will be convertible at the holders option for the quarter ending April 30, 2013 and will remain classified as a current liability on our consolidated balance sheet so long as the Notes are convertible. The Notes have a fixed annual interest rate of 0.75% and therefore, we do not have economic interest rate exposure on the Notes. However, the value of the Notes are exposed to interest rate risk. Generally, the fair market value of our fixed interest rate Notes will increase as interest rates fall and decrease as interest rates rise. In addition, the fair value of our Notes is affected by our stock price. The carrying value of our Notes was $521.3 million as of January 31, 2013. This represents the liability component of the $575.0 million principal balance as of January 31, 2013. The total estimated fair value of our Notes at January 31, 2013 was $1,178.5 million and the fair value was determined based on the closing trading price per $100 of the Notes as of the last day of trading for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013, which was $205.00. We have an investment portfolio that includes strategic investments in public and privately-held companies, many of which are in the development stage. When our ownership interests are less than 20 percent and we do not have the ability to exert significant influence, we account for investments in non-marketable equity and debt securities of the privately-held companies using the cost method of accounting. Otherwise, we account for the investments using the equity method of accounting. As of January 31, 2013 and 2012, the fair value of these investments in privately-held companies was $46.8 million and $48.3 million, respectively.  ##TABLE_START ", "8": " ITEM 8.

Our audits also included the financial statement schedule listed in the Index at Item 15(c). These financial statements and schedule are the responsibility of the Companys management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and schedule based on our audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of salesforce.com, inc. at January 31, 2013 and 2012, and the consolidated results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended January 31, 2013, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Also, in our opinion, the related financial statement schedule, when considered in relation to the basic financial statements taken as a whole, presents fairly in all material respects the information set forth therein.

We have audited salesforce.com, inc.s internal control over financial reporting as of January 31, 2013, based on criteria established in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (the COSO criteria). Salesforce.com, inc.s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Managements Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the companys internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. A companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. In our opinion, salesforce.com, inc. maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of January 31, 2013, based on the COSO criteria.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements 1. Summary of Business and Significant Accounting Policies Description of Business Salesforce.com, inc. (the Company) is a provider of enterprise cloud computing services. The Company is dedicated to helping customers of all sizes and industries worldwide transform themselves into customer companies by empowering them to connect with their customers, partners, employees and products in entirely new ways. The Company provides customers with the solutions they need to build a next generation social front office with social and mobile cloud technologies. Fiscal Year The Companys fiscal year ends on January 31. References to fiscal 2013, for example, refer to the fiscal year ending January 31, 2013. Use of Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions in the Companys consolidated financial statements and notes thereto. Significant estimates and assumptions made by management include the determination of: ##TABLE_START    the best estimate of selling price of the deliverables included in multiple-deliverable revenue arrangements, ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    the assessment of recoverability of long-lived assets (property and equipment, goodwill and identified intangibles), ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed for business combinations, ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    the recognition, measurement and valuation of current and deferred income taxes, ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    the recognition and measurement of loss contingencies, ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    the fair value of stock awards issued, and ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    the valuation of strategic investments and the determination of other-than-temporary impairments. ##TABLE_END Actual results could differ materially from those estimates. Principles of Consolidation The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. Segments The Company operates as one operating segment. Operating segments are defined as components of an enterprise for which separate financial information is evaluated regularly by the chief operating decision maker, who is the chief executive officer, in deciding how to allocate resources and assessing performance. Over the past few years, the Company has completed several acquisitions. These acquisitions have allowed the Company to expand its offerings, presence and reach in various market segments of the enterprise cloud computing market. While the Company has offerings in multiple enterprise cloud computing market segments, the Companys business operates in one operating segment because the Companys chief operating decision maker evaluates the Companys financial information and resources and assesses the performance of these resources on a consolidated basis. Since the Company operates in one operating segment, all required financial segment information can be found in the consolidated financial statements.  Concentrations of Credit Risk and Significant Customers The Companys financial instruments that are exposed to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities and trade accounts receivable. Although the Company deposits its cash with multiple financial institutions, its deposits, at times, may exceed federally insured limits. Collateral is not required for accounts receivable. The Company maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts receivable balances. The allowance is based upon historical loss patterns, the number of days that billings are past due and an evaluation of the potential risk of loss associated with delinquent accounts. No customer accounted for more than five percent of accounts receivable at January 31, 2013 and one customer accounted for six percent of accounts receivable at January 31, 2012. No single customer accounted for five percent or more of total revenue during fiscal 2013, 2012 and 2011. Geographic Locations As of January 31, 2013 and 2012, assets located outside the Americas were 16 percent and 13 percent of total assets, respectively. Revenues by geographical region are as follows (in thousands): ##TABLE_START   Fiscal Year Ended January 31,    2013   2012   2011  Americas  $ 2,123,736   $ 1,540,289   $ 1,135,019  Europe   525,304    408,456    291,784  Asia Pacific   401,155    317,794    230,336         $ 3,050,195   $ 2,266,539   $ 1,657,139        ##TABLE_END Approximately 94 percent, 93 percent and 94 percent of the Americas revenue in fiscal 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively, is attributed to the United States. Revenue Recognition The Company derives its revenues from two sources: (1) subscription revenues, which are comprised of subscription fees from customers accessing the Companys enterprise cloud computing services and from customers purchasing additional support beyond the standard support that is included in the basic subscription fees; and (2) related professional services such as process mapping, project management, implementation services and other revenue. Other revenue consists primarily of training fees. The Company commences revenue recognition when all of the following conditions are satisfied: ##TABLE_START    There is persuasive evidence of an arrangement; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    The service has been or is being provided to the customer; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    The collection of the fees is reasonably assured; and ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    The amount of fees to be paid by the customer is fixed or determinable. ##TABLE_END The Companys subscription service arrangements are non-cancelable and do not contain refund-type provisions. Subscription and Support Revenues Subscription and support revenues are recognized ratably over the contract terms beginning on the commencement date of each contract, which is the date the Companys service is made available to customers.  Amounts that have been invoiced are recorded in accounts receivable and in deferred revenue or revenue, depending on whether the revenue recognition criteria have been met. Professional Services and Other Revenues The majority of the Companys professional services contracts are on a time and material basis. When these services are not combined with subscription revenues as a single unit of accounting, as discussed below, these revenues are recognized as the services are rendered for time and material contracts, and when the milestones are achieved and accepted by the customer for fixed price contracts. Training revenues are recognized as the services are performed. Multiple-Deliverable Arrangements The Company enters into arrangements with multiple-deliverables that generally include subscription, premium support and professional services. Prior to February 1, 2011, the deliverables in multiple-deliverable arrangements were accounted for separately if the delivered items had standalone value and there was objective and reliable evidence of fair value for the undelivered items. If the deliverables in a multiple-deliverable arrangement could not be accounted for separately, the total arrangement fee was recognized ratably as a single unit of accounting over the contracted term of the subscription agreement. A significant portion of the Companys multiple-deliverable arrangements were accounted for as a single unit of accounting because the Company did not have objective and reliable evidence of fair value for certain of its deliverables. Additionally, in these situations, the Company deferred the direct costs of a related professional services arrangement and amortized those costs over the same period as the professional services revenue was recognized. In October 2009, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2009-13,  Revenue Recognition (Topic 605), Multiple-Deliverable Revenue Arrangementsa consensus of the FASB Emerging Issues Task Force  (ASU 2009-13) which amended the previous multiple-deliverable arrangements accounting guidance. Pursuant to the updated guidance, objective and reliable evidence of fair value of the deliverables to be delivered is no longer required in order to account for deliverables in a multiple-deliverable arrangement separately. Instead, arrangement consideration is allocated to deliverables based on their relative selling price. In the first quarter of fiscal 2012, the Company adopted this updated accounting guidance on a prospective basis. The Company applied the updated accounting guidance to those multiple-deliverable arrangements entered into or materially modified on or after February 1, 2011, which was the beginning of the Companys fiscal 2012. The adoption of this updated accounting guidance did not have a material impact on the Companys financial condition, results of operations or cash flows for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2012. As of January 31, 2013, the deferred professional services revenue and deferred costs under the previous accounting guidance are $9.3 million and approximately $3.9 million, respectively, which will continue to be recognized over the related remaining subscription period. Under the updated accounting guidance, in order to treat deliverables in a multiple-deliverable arrangement as separate units of accounting, the deliverables must have standalone value upon delivery. If the deliverables have standalone value upon delivery, the Company accounts for each deliverable separately. Subscription services have standalone value as such services are often sold separately. In determining whether professional services have standalone value, the Company considers the following factors for each professional services agreement: availability of the services from other vendors, the nature of the professional services, the timing of when the professional services contract was signed in comparison to the subscription service start date and the contractual dependence of the subscription service on the customers satisfaction with the professional services work. To date, the Company has concluded that all of the professional services included in multiple-deliverable arrangements executed have standalone value.  Under the updated accounting guidance, when multiple-deliverables included in an arrangement are separated into different units of accounting, the arrangement consideration is allocated to the identified separate units based on a relative selling price hierarchy. The Company determines the relative selling price for a deliverable based on its vendor-specific objective evidence of selling price (VSOE), if available, or its best estimate of selling price (BESP), if VSOE is not available. The Company has determined that third-party evidence of selling price (TPE) is not a practical alternative due to differences in its service offerings compared to other parties and the availability of relevant third-party pricing information. The amount of revenue allocated to delivered items is limited by contingent revenue, if any. For certain professional services, the Company has established VSOE as a consistent number of standalone sales of this deliverable have been priced within a reasonably narrow range. The Company has not established VSOE for its subscription services due to lack of pricing consistency, the introduction of new services and other factors. Accordingly, the Company uses its BESP to determine the relative selling price. The Company determined BESP by considering its overall pricing objectives and market conditions. Significant pricing practices taken into consideration include the Companys discounting practices, the size and volume of the Companys transactions, the customer demographic, the geographic area where services are sold, price lists, its go-to-market strategy, historical standalone sales and contract prices. The determination of BESP is made through consultation with and approval by the Companys management, taking into consideration the go-to-market strategy. As the Companys go-to-market strategies evolve, the Company may modify its pricing practices in the future, which could result in changes in relative selling prices, including both VSOE and BESP. Deferred Revenue The deferred revenue balance does not represent the total contract value of annual or multi-year, non-cancelable subscription agreements. Deferred revenue primarily consists of billings or payments received in advance of revenue recognition from subscription services described above and is recognized as the revenue recognition criteria are met. The Company generally invoices customers in annual or quarterly installments. Deferred revenue is influenced by several factors, including seasonality, the compounding effects of renewals, invoice duration, invoice timing and new business linearity within the quarter. Deferred revenue that will be recognized during the succeeding twelve month period is recorded as current deferred revenue and the remaining portion is recorded as noncurrent. Deferred Commissions Deferred commissions are the incremental costs that are directly associated with non-cancelable subscription contracts with customers and consist of sales commissions paid to the Companys direct sales force. The commissions are deferred and amortized over the non-cancelable terms of the related customer contracts, which are typically 12 to 36 months. The commission payments are paid in full the month after the customers service commences. The deferred commission amounts are recoverable through the future revenue streams under the non-cancelable customer contracts. The Company believes this is the preferable method of accounting as the commission charges are so closely related to the revenue from the non-cancelable customer contracts that they should be recorded as an asset and charged to expense over the same period that the subscription revenue is recognized. Amortization of deferred commissions is included in marketing and sales expense in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations. Cash and Cash Equivalents The Company considers all highly liquid investments purchased with an original maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents. Cash and cash equivalents are stated at fair value.  Marketable Securities Management determines the appropriate classification of marketable securities at the time of purchase and reevaluates such determination at each balance sheet date. Securities are classified as available for sale and are carried at fair value, with the change in unrealized gains and losses, net of tax, reported as a separate component on the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income (Loss). Fair value is determined based on quoted market rates when observable or utilizing data points that are observable, such as quoted prices, interest rates and yield curves. Declines in fair value judged to be other-than-temporary on securities available for sale are included as a component of investment income. In order to determine whether a decline in value is other-than-temporary, the Company evaluates, among other factors: the duration and extent to which the fair value has been less than the carrying value and its intent and ability to retain the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in fair value. The cost of securities sold is based on the specific-identification method. Interest on securities classified as available for sale is also included as a component of investment income. Fair Value Measurement The Company measures its cash equivalents, marketable securities and foreign currency derivative contracts at fair value. The Company reports its financial and non-financial assets and liabilities that are re-measured and reported at fair value at each reporting period. The additional disclosures regarding the Companys fair value measurements are included in Note 2. Property and Equipment Property and equipment are stated at cost. Depreciation is calculated on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of those assets as follows: ##TABLE_START Computer, equipment and software  3 to 7 years Furniture and fixtures  5 years Leasehold improvements  Shorter of the lease term or 10 years Building improvements  Amortized over the estimated useful lives of the respective assets when they are ready for their intended use. ##TABLE_END When assets are retired or otherwise disposed of, the cost and accumulated depreciation and amortization are removed from their respective accounts and any loss on such retirement is reflected in operating expenses. Capitalized Internal-Use Software Costs The Company capitalizes costs related to its enterprise cloud computing services and certain projects for internal use incurred during the application development stage. Costs related to preliminary project activities and post implementation activities are expensed as incurred. Internal-use software is amortized on a straight line basis over its estimated useful life. Management evaluates the useful lives of these assets on an annual basis and tests for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances occur that could impact the recoverability of these assets. Goodwill, Intangible Assets, Long-Lived Assets and Impairment Assessments The Company evaluates and tests the recoverability of its goodwill for impairment at least annually during the fourth quarter or more often if and when circumstances indicate that goodwill may not be recoverable.  Intangible assets are amortized over their useful lives. Each period the Company evaluates the estimated remaining useful life of its intangible assets and whether events or changes in circumstances warrant a revision to the remaining period of amortization. The carrying amounts of these assets are periodically reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of these assets may not be recoverable. Recoverability of these assets is measured by comparison of the carrying amount of each asset to the future undiscounted cash flows the asset is expected to generate. If the undiscounted cash flows used in the test for recoverability are less than the carrying amount of these assets then the Company will recognize an impairment charge. The Company evaluates the recoverability of its long-lived assets for possible impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable. If such review indicates that the carrying amount of long-lived assets is not recoverable, the carrying amount of such assets is reduced to fair value. Business Combinations The Company uses its best estimates and assumptions to accurately assign fair value to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date. The Companys estimates are inherently uncertain and subject to refinement. As a result, during the measurement period, which may be up to one year from the acquisition date, the Company may record adjustments to the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed, with the corresponding offset to goodwill. Upon the conclusion of the measurement period or final determination of the fair value of assets acquired or liabilities assumed, whichever comes first, any subsequent adjustments are recorded to the Companys consolidated statements of operations. In addition, income tax uncertainties and tax related valuation allowances assumed in connection with a business combination are initially estimated as of the acquisition date. The Company continues to collect information and reevaluates these items quarterly and records any adjustments to the Companys preliminary estimates to goodwill provided that the Company is within the measurement period. Subsequent to the measurement period, changes to these income tax uncertainties and tax related valuation allowances will affect the Companys provision for income taxes in the Companys consolidated statements of operations. Leases and Asset Retirement Obligations The Company categorizes leases at their inception as either operating or capital leases. On certain lease agreements, the Company may receive rent holidays and other incentives. The Company recognizes lease costs on a straight-line basis once control of the space is achieved, without regard to deferred payment terms, such as rent holidays that defer the commencement date of required payments. Additionally, incentives received are treated as a reduction of costs over the term of the agreement. Leasehold improvements are capitalized at cost and amortized over the lesser of the non-cancellable term of the lease or 10 years. The Company establishes assets and liabilities for the present value of estimated future costs to retire long-lived assets at the termination or expiration of a lease. Such assets are depreciated over the lease period into operating expense, and the recorded liabilities are accreted to the future value of the estimated retirement costs. Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation The Company recognizes stock-based expenses related to stock options and restricted stock awards on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period of the awards, which is generally the vesting term of four years. The Company recognizes stock-based expenses related to shares issued pursuant to its Employee Stock Purchase Plan (ESPP) on a straight-line basis over the offering period, which is 12 months. Stock-based expenses are recognized net of estimated forfeiture activity.  The fair value of each stock option grant and stock purchase right granted under the ESPP was estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model with the following assumptions and fair value per share: ##TABLE_START   Fiscal Year Ended January 31,  Stock Options  2013   2012   2011  Volatility   43 - 51 %   47 - 51 %   45 - 50 % Estimated life   3.7 years    3.7 years    3.7 - 3.8 years  Risk-free interest rate   0.43 - 0.77 %   0.68 - 1.77 %   0.98 - 2.10 % Dividend yield   0    0    0  Weighted-average fair value per share of grants  $ 51.77   $ 49.14   $ 48.83    Fiscal Year Ended January 31,  ESPP  2013   2012   2011  Volatility   39 - 46 %   50 - 53 %   n/a  Estimated life   0.75 years    0.75 years    n/a  Risk-free interest rate   0.03 - 0.22 %   0.95 - 1.08 %   n/a  Dividend yield   0    0    n/a  Weighted-average fair value per share of grants  $ 45.55   $ 34.34    n/a  ##TABLE_END The Company estimated its future stock price volatility considering both its observed option-implied volatilities and its historical volatility calculations. Management believes this is the best estimate of the expected volatility over the expected life of its stock options and stock purchase rights. The estimated life for the stock options was based on an actual analysis of expected life. The estimated life for the ESPP was based on the two purchase periods within each offering period. The risk free interest rate is based on the rate for a U.S. government security with the same estimated life at the time of the option grant and the stock purchase rights. There was no stock-based expense related to the ESPP in fiscal 2011 because the Company did not commence the ESPP until December 2011. Advertising Expenses Advertising is expensed as incurred. Advertising expense was $110.7 million, $80.3 million and $61.4 million for fiscal 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively. Income Taxes The Company uses the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on temporary differences between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax laws is recognized in the consolidated statement of operations in the period that includes the enactment date. Valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amounts more likely than not expected to be realized. The Companys tax positions are subject to income tax audits by multiple tax jurisdictions throughout the world. The Company recognizes the tax benefit of an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the position is sustainable upon examination by the taxing authority, based on the technical merits. The tax benefit recognized is measured as the largest amount of benefit which is greater than 50 percent likely to be realized upon settlement with the taxing authority. The Company recognizes interest accrued and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in the income tax provision.  Foreign Currency Translation The functional currency of the Companys major foreign subsidiaries is generally the local currency. Adjustments resulting from translating foreign functional currency financial statements into U.S. dollars are recorded as a separate component on the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income (Loss). Foreign currency transaction gains and losses are included in net income (loss) for the period. All assets and liabilities denominated in a foreign currency are translated into U.S. dollars at the exchange rate on the balance sheet date. Revenues and expenses are translated at the average exchange rate during the period. Equity transactions are translated using historical exchange rates. All amounts recorded to other comprehensive income (loss) subsequent to the date of this change, will revalue with fluctuations in foreign currency. Warranties and Indemnification The Companys enterprise cloud computing services are typically warranted to perform in a manner consistent with general industry standards that are reasonably applicable and materially in accordance with the Companys online help documentation under normal use and circumstances. The Companys arrangements generally include certain provisions for indemnifying customers against liabilities if its products or services infringe a third-partys intellectual property rights. To date, the Company has not incurred any material costs as a result of such obligations and has not accrued any liabilities related to such obligations in the accompanying consolidated financial statements. The Company has also agreed to indemnify its directors and executive officers for costs associated with any fees, expenses, judgments, fines and settlement amounts incurred by any of these persons in any action or proceeding to which any of those persons is, or is threatened to be, made a party by reason of the persons service as a director or officer, including any action by the Company, arising out of that persons services as the Companys director or officer or that persons services provided to any other company or enterprise at the Companys request. The Company maintains director and officer insurance coverage that would generally enable the Company to recover a portion of any future amounts paid. The Company may also be subject to indemnification obligations by law with respect to the actions of its employees under certain circumstances and in certain jurisdictions. New Accounting Pronouncement In July 2012, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2012-02, IntangiblesGoodwill and Other (Topic 350)Testing Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets for Impairment (ASU 2012-02), to allow entities to use a qualitative approach to test indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment. ASU 2012-02 permits an entity to first perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of an indefinite-lived intangible asset is less than its carrying value. If it is concluded that this is the case, it is necessary to perform the currently prescribed quantitative impairment test by comparing the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset with its carrying value. Otherwise, the quantitative impairment test is not required. The Company plans to adopt ASU 2012-02 by the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014 and does not believe that the adoption will have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements. Reclassifications Certain reclassifications to the fiscal 2012 balances were made to conform to the current period presentation. These reclassifications include accounts payable, accrued expenses and other liabilities, long-term lease liabilities and deferred income taxes.  2.

The Company does not believe any of the unrealized losses represent an other-than-temporary impairment based on its evaluation of available evidence as of January 31, 2013. The Company expects to receive the full principal and interest on all of these marketable securities. Fair Value Measurement All of the Companys cash equivalents, marketable securities and foreign currency derivative contracts are classified within Level 1 or Level 2 because the Companys cash equivalents, marketable securities and foreign currency derivative contracts are valued using quoted market prices or alternative pricing sources and models utilizing market observable inputs. During fiscal 2013 the Company changed how it categorizes certain amounts within the fair value hierarchy. The $26.5 million of time deposits at January 31, 2012 are now reported as Level 2 fair value instruments as these were previously shown as Level 1. The Company uses a three-tier fair value hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used in the valuation methodologies in measuring fair value: Level 1 . Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. Level 2. Other inputs that are directly or indirectly observable in the marketplace. Level 3. Unobservable inputs which are supported by little or no market activity. The following table presents information about the Companys assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value as of January 31, 2013 and indicates the fair value hierarchy of the valuation (in thousands): ##TABLE_START Description  Quoted Prices in Active Markets for Identical Assets (Level 1)   Significant Other Observable Inputs (Level 2)   Significant Unobservable Inputs (Level 3)   Balances as of January 31, 2013  Cash equivalents (1):     Time deposits  $ 0   $ 22,372   $ 0   $ 22,372  Money market mutual funds   385,700    0    0    385,700  Marketable securities:     Corporate notes and obligations   0    689,889    0    689,889  U.S. treasury securities   38,869    0    0    38,869  Mortgage backed securities   0    12,723    0    12,723  Government obligations   9,641    0    0    9,641  Municipal securities   0    2,666    0    2,666  Collateralized mortgage obligations   0    151,876    0    151,876  U.S. agency obligations   0    105,376    0    105,376  Foreign currency derivative contracts (2)   0    5,643    0    5,643          Total Assets  $ 434,210   $ 990,545   $ 0   $ 1,424,755          Liabilities     Foreign currency derivative contracts (3)  $ 0   $ 3,307   $ 0   $ 3,307          Total Liabilities  $ 0   $ 3,307   $ 0   $ 3,307          ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START (1) Included in cash and cash equivalents in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheet as of January 31, 2013, in addition to $339.2 million of cash. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START (2) Included in prepaid expenses and other current assets in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheet as of January 31, 2013. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START (3) Included in accounts payable, accrued expenses and other liabilities in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheet as of January 31, 2013. ##TABLE_END  The following table presents information about the Companys assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value as of January 31, 2012 and indicates the fair value hierarchy of the valuation (in thousands): ##TABLE_START Description  Quoted Prices in Active Markets for Identical Assets (Level 1)   Significant Other Observable Inputs (Level 2)   Significant Unobservable Inputs (Level 3)   Balances as of January 31, 2012  Cash equivalents (1):     Time deposits  $ 0   $ 26,513   $ 0   $ 26,513  Money market mutual funds   358,369    0    0    358,369  Marketable securities:     Corporate notes and obligations   0    504,772    0    504,772  U.S. treasury securities   79,358    0    0    79,358  Mortgage backed securities   0    15,426    0    15,426  Government obligations   3,210    0    0    3,210  Municipal securities   0    8,789    0    8,789  Collateralized mortgage obligations   0    120,495    0    120,495  U.S. agency obligations   0    107,840    0    107,840  Foreign currency derivative contracts (2)   0    621    0    621          Total Assets  $ 440,937   $ 784,456   $ 0   $ 1,225,393          Liabilities     Foreign currency derivative contracts (3)  $ 0   $ 2,551   $ 0   $ 2,551          Total Liabilities  $ 0   $ 2,551   $ 0   $ 2,551          ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START (1) Included in cash and cash equivalents in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheet as of January 31, 2012, in addition to $222.4 million of cash. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START (2) Included in prepaid expenses and other current assets in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheet as of January 31, 2012. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START (3) Included in accounts payable, accrued expenses and other liabilities in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheet as of January 31, 2012. ##TABLE_END Derivative Financial Instruments The Company enters into foreign currency derivative contracts with financial institutions to reduce the risk that its cash flows and earnings will be adversely affected by foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. The Company uses forward currency derivative contracts to minimize the Companys exposure of balances primarily denominated in Euros, Japanese yen, Canadian dollars and British pounds. The Companys foreign currency derivative contracts which are not designated as hedging instruments are used to reduce the exchange rate risk associated primarily with intercompany receivables and payables. The Companys program is not designated for trading or speculative purposes. As of January 31, 2013, the foreign currency derivative contracts that were not settled are recorded at fair value on the consolidated balance sheets. Foreign currency derivative contracts are marked-to-market at the end of each reporting period with gains and losses recognized as other income (expense) to offset the gains or losses resulting from the settlement or remeasurement of the underlying foreign currency denominated receivables and payables. While the contract or notional amount is often used to express the volume of foreign currency derivative contracts, the amounts potentially subject to credit risk are generally limited to the amounts, if any, by which the counterparties obligations under the agreements exceed the obligations of the Company to the counterparties.  Details on outstanding foreign currency derivative contracts related primarily to intercompany receivables and payables are presented below (in thousands): ##TABLE_START    As of January 31,     2013   2012  Notional amount of foreign currency derivative contracts  $ 692,637   $ 186,336  Fair value of foreign currency derivative contracts  $ 2,336   $ (1,930 ) ##TABLE_END The fair value of the Companys outstanding derivative instruments are summarized below (in thousands): ##TABLE_START      Fair Value of Derivative Instruments       As of January 31,    Balance Sheet Location   2013   2012  Derivative Assets    Derivatives not designated as hedging instruments:    Foreign currency derivative contracts    Prepaid expenses and other current assets    $ 5,643   $ 621       Derivative Liabilities    Derivatives not designated as hedging instruments:    Foreign currency derivative contracts     Accounts payable, accrued expenses and other liabilities     $ 3,307   $ 2,551       ##TABLE_END The effect of the derivative instruments not designated as hedging instruments on the consolidated statements of operations during fiscal 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively are summarized below (in thousands): ##TABLE_START Derivatives Not Designated as Hedging Instruments  Gains (Losses) on Derivative Instruments Recognized in Income       Fiscal Year Ended January 31,     Location   2013   2012   2011  Foreign currency derivative contracts   Other expense   $ 16,591   $ 6,221   $ (3,098 )        ##TABLE_END Strategic Investments The Company has four investments in marketable equity securities measured using quoted prices in their respective active markets and certain interests in non-marketable equity and debt securities that are collectively considered strategic investments.

As of January 31, 2012, the Company had two investments in marketable equity securities. The fair value of the Companys marketable equity securities of $5.6 million included an unrealized gain of $3.4 million. These investments are recorded in other assets, net on the consolidated balance sheets. The Companys interest in non-marketable equity and debt securities consists of noncontrolling equity and debt investments in privately-held companies. The Companys investments in these privately-held companies are reported at cost or marked down to fair value when an event or circumstance indicates an other-than-temporary decline in value has occurred. These investments are valued using significant unobservable inputs or data in an inactive market and the valuation requires the Companys judgment due to the absence of market price and inherent lack of liquidity. As of January 31, 2013 and 2012, the carrying value that approximates the fair value of the Companys investments in privately-held companies was $46.8 million and $48.3 million, respectively. These investments are recorded in other assets, net on the consolidated balance sheets.

The Notes are governed by an Indenture dated as of January 19, 2010, between the Company, as issuer, and U.S. Bank National Association, as trustee. The Notes do not contain any financial covenants or any restrictions on the payment of dividends, the incurrence of senior debt or other indebtedness, or the issuance or repurchase of securities by the Company. The Notes are unsecured and rank senior in right of payment to the Companys future indebtedness that is expressly subordinated in right of payment to the Notes and rank equal in right of payment to the Companys existing and future unsecured indebtedness that is not so subordinated and are effectively subordinated in right of payment to any of the Companys cash equal to the principal amount of the Notes, and secured indebtedness to the extent of the value of the assets securing such indebtedness and are structurally subordinated to all existing and future indebtedness and liabilities incurred by our subsidiaries, including trade payables. If converted, holders will receive cash equal to the principal amount of the Notes, and at the Companys election, cash and/or shares of the Companys common stock for any amounts in excess of the principal amounts. The initial conversion rate is 11.7147 shares of common stock per $1,000 principal amount of Notes, subject to anti-dilution adjustments. The initial conversion price is $85.36 per share of common stock. Throughout the term of the Notes, the conversion rate may be adjusted upon the occurrence of certain events, including for any cash dividends. Holders of the Notes will not receive any cash payment representing accrued and unpaid interest upon conversion of a Note. Accrued but unpaid interest will be deemed to be paid in full upon conversion rather than cancelled, extinguished or forfeited. Holders may convert their Notes under the following circumstances: ##TABLE_START    during any fiscal quarter, if, for at least 20 trading days during the 30 consecutive trading day period ending on the last trading day of the immediately preceding fiscal quarter, the last reported sales price of the Companys common stock for such trading day is greater than or equal to 130% of the applicable conversion price on such trading day share of common stock on such last trading day; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    in certain situations, when the trading price of the Notes is less than 98% of the product of the sale price of the Companys common stock and the conversion rate; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    upon the occurrence of specified corporate transactions described under the Notes Indenture, such as a consolidation, merger or binding share exchange; or ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    at any time on or after October 15, 2014. ##TABLE_END For 20 trading days during the 30 consecutive trading days ended October 31, 2012, the Companys common stock traded at a price exceeding 130% of the conversion price of $85.36 per share applicable to the Notes. Accordingly, the Notes were convertible at the option of the holder for the Companys common shares as of January 31, 2013 and were classified as a current liability on the Companys consolidated balance sheet. For 20 trading days during the 30 consecutive trading days ended January 31, 2013, the Companys common stock traded at a price exceeding 130% of the conversion price of $85.36 per share applicable to the Notes. Accordingly, the Notes will remain convertible at the holders option for the quarter ending April 30, 2013 and will remain classified as a current liability on the Companys consolidated balance sheet so long as the Notes are convertible. Holders of the Notes have the right to require the Company to purchase with cash all or a portion of the Notes upon the occurrence of a fundamental change, such as a change of control, at a purchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Notes plus accrued and unpaid interest. Following certain corporate transactions that constitute a change of control, the Company will increase the conversion rate for a holder who elects to convert the Notes in connection with such change of control in certain circumstances.  In accounting for the issuance of the Notes, the Company separated the Notes into liability and equity components. The carrying amount of the liability component was calculated by measuring the fair value of a similar liability that does not have an associated convertible feature. The carrying amount of the equity component representing the conversion option was determined by deducting the fair value of the liability component from the par value of the Notes as a whole. The excess of the principal amount of the liability component over its carrying amount (debt discount) is amortized to interest expense over the term of the Notes. The equity component is not remeasured as long as it continues to meet the conditions for equity classification. In accounting for the transaction costs related to the Note issuance, the Company allocated the total amount incurred to the liability and equity components based on their relative values. Transaction costs attributable to the liability component are being amortized to expense over the term of the Notes, and transaction costs attributable to the equity component were netted with the equity component in temporary stockholders equity and stockholders equity. Additionally, the Company recorded a deferred tax liability of $51.1 million in connection with the Notes. The Notes consisted of the following (in thousands): ##TABLE_START   As of January 31,    2013   2012  Liability component :   Principal  $ 574,890   $ 574,890  Less: debt discount, net   (53,612 )   (78,741 )     Net carrying amount  $ 521,278   $ 496,149      ##TABLE_END As of January 31, 2013, the remaining life of the Notes is approximately 2.0 years. The following table sets forth total interest expense recognized related to the Notes prior to capitalization of interest (in thousands): ##TABLE_START   Fiscal Year Ended January 31,    2013   2012  Contractual interest expense  $ 4,313   $ 4,312  Amortization of debt issuance costs   1,324    1,324  Amortization of debt discount   25,131    23,720       $ 30,768   $ 29,356      Effective interest rate of the liability component   5.86 %   5.86 % ##TABLE_END Interest Expense Interest expense consists of interest on the Companys capital lease commitments and the Notes, net of amounts capitalized. In accounting for the Notes at the time of issuance in January 2010, the carrying amount of the liability component was calculated by measuring the fair value of a similar liability that did not have an associated convertible feature. The excess of the principal amount of the liability component over its carrying amount is amortized, using an effective interest rate of 5.86%, to interest expense over the term of the Notes. Interest costs of $1.6 million, $14.1 million and $3.7 million related to the buildings and improvements and $0.8 million, $0.5 million and $0.3 million related to the Companys capitalized internal-use software development efforts were capitalized in fiscal 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively. During the first quarter of fiscal 2013, the Company suspended pre-construction activity, which includes capitalized interest costs, on the undeveloped real estate in San Francisco, California causing capitalization of interest costs to cease.  Note Hedges To minimize the impact of potential economic dilution upon conversion of the Notes, the Company entered into convertible note hedge transactions with respect to its common stock (the Note Hedges). The Company paid, in January 2010, an aggregate amount of $126.5 million for the Note Hedges. The Note Hedges cover approximately 6.7 million shares of the Companys common stock at a strike price that corresponds to the initial conversion price of the Notes, also subject to adjustment, and are exercisable upon conversion of the Notes. The Note Hedges will expire upon the maturity of the Notes. The Note Hedges are intended to reduce the potential economic dilution upon conversion of the Notes in the event that the market value per share of the Companys common stock, as measured under the Notes, at the time of exercise is greater than the conversion price of the Notes. The Note Hedges are separate transactions and are not part of the terms of the Notes. Holders of the Notes will not have any rights with respect to the Note Hedges. The Company initially recorded a deferred tax asset of $51.4 million in connection with these Note Hedges. Warrants Separately, the Company in January 2010 also entered into warrant transactions (the Warrants), whereby the Company sold warrants to acquire, subject to anti-dilution adjustments, up to 6.7 million shares of the Companys common stock at a strike price of $119.51 per share. The Company received aggregate proceeds of $59.3 million from the sale of the Warrants. As the average market value per share of the Companys common stock for the reporting period, as measured under the Warrants, exceeds the strike price of the Warrants, the Warrants would have a dilutive effect on the Companys earnings/loss per share. The Warrants were anti-dilutive during fiscal 2013 based on the Companys net loss fiscal 2013. The Warrants are separate transactions, entered into by the Company and are not part of the terms of the Notes or Note Hedges. Holders of the Notes and Note Hedges will not have any rights with respect to the Warrants. 6.

Stockholders Equity The Company maintains the following stock plans: the 2006 Inducement Equity Incentive Plan (the Inducement Plan), the 2004 Equity Incentive Plan, 2004 Employee Stock Purchase Plan and the 2004 Outside Directors Stock Plan. These plans, other than the 2004 Outside Directors Stock Plan and the Inducement Plan, provide for annual automatic increases on February 1 to the shares reserved for issuance. The expiration of the 1999 Stock Option Plan (1999 Plan) in fiscal 2010 did not affect awards outstanding, which continue to be governed by the terms and conditions of the 1999 Plan.   On February 1, 2012, 3.5 million additional shares were reserved under the 2004 Equity Incentive Plan and 1.0 million additional shares were reserved under the 2004 Employee Stock Purchase Plan pursuant to the automatic increase in each respective plan. On June 7, 2012, 400,000 additional shares were reserved under the Inducement Plan. On February 1, 2013, 3.5 million additional shares were reserved under the 2004 Equity Incentive Plan. In September 2011, the Companys Board of Directors amended and restated the 2004 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the ESPP). In conjunction with the amendment of the ESPP, the Companys Board of Directors determined that the offerings under the ESPP would commence, beginning with a twelve month offering period starting in December 2011. As of January 31, 2013, $17.6 million has been held on behalf of employees for future purchases under the plan and is recorded in accrued expenses and other liabilities. Employees purchased 738,310 shares in fiscal year 2013 for $69.1 million under the ESPP. Prior to February 1, 2006, options issued under the Companys stock option plans generally had a term of 10 years. After February 1, 2006, options issued have a term of 5 years.

The expense related to these awards, which was expensed immediately at the time of the issuance, totaled $3.8 million, $4.9 million and $4.9 million for fiscal 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively. Preferred Stock The Companys board of directors has the authority, without further action by stockholders, to issue up to 5,000,000 shares of preferred stock in one or more series. The Companys board of directors may designate the rights, preferences, privileges and restrictions of the preferred stock, including dividend rights, conversion rights, voting rights, terms of redemption, liquidation preference, sinking fund terms, and number of shares constituting any series or the designation of any series. The issuance of preferred stock could have the effect of restricting dividends on the Companys common stock, diluting the voting power of its common stock, impairing the liquidation rights of its common stock, or delaying or preventing a change in control. The ability to issue preferred stock could delay or impede a change in control. At January 31, 2013 and 2012, no shares of preferred stock were outstanding. 8.

These temporary tax reduction programs will expire in 2016 and 2014, respectively. The Singapore program, however, is eligible for renewal.  Deferred Income Taxes Deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effect of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes. Significant components of the Companys deferred tax assets and liabilities were as follows (in thousands): ##TABLE_START   As of January 31,    2013   2012  Deferred tax assets:   Net operating loss carryforwards  $ 62,603   $ 35,942  Deferred stock compensation   69,593    61,029  Tax credits   75,812    54,243  Deferred rent expense   28,022    11,661  Accrued liabilities   63,257    49,825  Deferred revenue   30,441    5,936  Basis difference on investment   8,569    3,789  Other   9,916    6,792      Total deferred tax assets   348,213    229,217  Less valuation allowance   (192,682 )   (4,624 )     Deferred tax assets, net of valuation allowance   155,531    224,593  Deferred tax liabilities:   Deferred commissions   (72,470 )   (49,029 ) Purchased intangibles   (14,739 )   (18,052 ) Unrealized gains on investments   (2,768 )   (2,881 ) Depreciation and amortization   (41,832 )   (26,352 ) Other   (7,351 )   (8,871 )     Total deferred tax liabilities   (139,160 )   (105,185 )     Net deferred tax assets  $ 16,371   $ 119,408      ##TABLE_END The Company regularly assesses the need for a valuation allowance against its deferred tax assets. In making that assessment, the Company considers both positive and negative evidence related to the likelihood of realization of the deferred tax assets to determine, based on the weight of available evidence, whether it is more-likely-than-not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. In evaluating the need for a valuation allowance, the Company considers its cumulative loss in recent years as a significant piece of negative evidence. Therefore, in fiscal 2013, the Company established a valuation allowance against a significant portion of its deferred tax assets and its valuation allowance increased by $188.1 million at January 31, 2013. The Company will continue to assess the realizability of the deferred tax assets in each of the applicable jurisdictions going forward and adjust the valuation allowance accordingly. The excess tax benefits associated with stock option exercises are recorded directly to stockholders equity only when the tax deduction is realized on the income tax returns. As a result, the excess tax benefits included in net operating loss carryforwards but are not reflected in deferred tax assets for fiscal 2013 and 2012 are $316.2 million and $149.1 million, respectively. At January 31, 2013, the Company had net operating loss carryforwards for federal income tax purposes of approximately $955.0 million, which expire in 2021 through 2033, federal research and development tax credits of approximately $52.7 million, which expire in 2020 through 2033, foreign tax credits of approximately $7.9 million, which expire in 2019 through 2023, and minimum tax credits of $0.7 million, which have no expiration date. The Company also had net operating loss carryforwards for state income tax purposes of approximately $489.8 million which expire beginning in 2015 and state research and development tax credits of approximately $49.0 million and $10.0 million of state enterprise zone tax credits, which do not expire. Utilization of the Companys net operating loss carryforwards may be subject to substantial annual limitation due  to the ownership change limitations provided by the Internal Revenue Code and similar state provisions. Such an annual limitation could result in the expiration of the net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards before utilization. Tax Benefits Related to Stock-Based Compensation The total income tax benefit in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations related to stock-based awards was $113.9 million, $76.0 million and $44.1 million for fiscal 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively. Beginning in fiscal 2013, the majority of the tax benefit was not recognized as a result of the valuation allowance. The Company reduced its income tax payable by the tax benefit realized from the exercise, sale or vesting of the stock options or similar instruments during fiscal 2013 was $127.2 million. Unrecognized Tax Benefits and Other Considerations Tax positions for the Company and its subsidiaries are subject to income tax audits by many tax jurisdictions throughout the world. The Company recognizes the tax benefit of an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the position is sustainable upon examination by the taxing authority, based on the technical merits. The tax benefit recognized is measured as the largest amount of benefit which is greater than 50 percent likely to be realized upon settlement with the taxing authority. The Company had gross unrecognized tax benefits of $75.1 million and $52.0 million as of January 31, 2013 and 2012 respectively. A reconciliation of the beginning and ending balance of total unrecognized tax benefits for fiscal years 2013, 2012, and 2011 is as follows (in thousands): ##TABLE_START   Fiscal Year Ended January 31,    2013   2012   2011  Balance as of February 1,  $ 51,971   $ 27,462   $ 22,053  Tax positions taken in prior period:    Gross increases   7,304    10,008    41  Gross decreases   (4,460 )   (23 )   (811 ) Tax positions taken in current period:    Gross increases   24,401    15,965    8,047  Settlements   (121 )   0    (39 ) Lapse of statute of limitations   (4,159 )   (1,143 )   (1,741 ) Currency translation effect   208    (298 )   (88 )       Balance as of January 31,  $ 75,144   $ 51,971   $ 27,462        ##TABLE_END For fiscal year 2013, 2012 and 2011 total unrecognized tax benefits in an amount of $32.3 million, $39.1 million, and $20.4 million respectively, if recognized, would reduce income tax expense and the Companys effective tax rate. The Company recognizes interest accrued and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in the income tax provision. The Company accrued no penalties and interest in the amount of $1.7 million in income tax expense at the end of January 31, 2013. The Companys U.S. federal and state tax returns for several tax years since February 1999, which was the inception of the Company, remain open to examination. Outside the U.S., the Company operates in major jurisdictions including Canada, Australia, Japan and United Kingdom. With some exceptions, all tax years in jurisdictions outside of U.S. are generally open and could be subject to examinations, however, in Japan and United Kingdom, the Company is no longer subject to examinations for years prior to fiscal 2008 and 2010, respectively.  The Company believes that it has provided adequate reserves for its income tax uncertainties in all open tax years. In the next 12 months, it is reasonably possible that the unrecognized tax benefits may decrease by approximately $4.0 million due to lapsing of the statute of limitations. 9. Earnings/Loss Per Share Basic earnings/loss per share is computed by dividing net income (loss) by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding for the fiscal period. Diluted earnings/loss per share is computed giving effect to all potential weighted average dilutive common stock, including options, restricted stock units, warrants and the convertible senior notes. The dilutive effect of outstanding awards and convertible securities is reflected in diluted earnings per share by application of the treasury stock method. Diluted loss per share for fiscal 2013 and 2012 are the same as basic loss per share as there is a net loss in these periods and inclusion of potentially issuable shares would be anti-dilutive. A reconciliation of the denominator used in the calculation of basic and diluted earnings/loss per share is as follows (in thousands): ##TABLE_START      Fiscal Year Ended January 31,    2013   2012   2011  Numerator:    Net income (loss) attributable to salesforce.com  $ (270,445 )  $ (11,572 )  $ 64,474        Denominator:    Weighted-average shares outstanding for basic income (loss) per share   141,224    135,302    130,222  Effect of dilutive securities:    Convertible senior notes   0    0    1,561  Employee stock awards   0    0    4,815  Warrants   0    0    0        Adjusted weighted-average shares outstanding and assumed conversions for diluted income (loss) per share   141,224    135,302    136,598        ##TABLE_END The weighted-average number of shares outstanding used in the computation of basic and diluted earnings/loss per share does not include the effect of the following potential outstanding common stock. The effects of these potentially outstanding shares were not included in the calculation of diluted earnings/loss per share because the effect would have been anti-dilutive (in thousands): ##TABLE_START      Fiscal Year Ended January 31,    2013   2012   2011  Stock awards   7,517    7,560    1,061  Warrants   6,736    6,736    6,376  Convertible senior notes   6,735    6,735    0  ##TABLE_END 10. Commitments Letters of Credit As of January 31, 2013, the Company had a total of $60.8 million in letters of credit outstanding substantially in favor of certain landlords for office space. These letters of credit renew annually and mature at various dates through December 2030.  Leases The Company leases facilities space and certain fixed assets under non-cancelable operating and capital leases with various expiration dates. As of January 31, 2013, the future minimum lease payments under non-cancelable operating and capital leases are as follows (in thousands): ##TABLE_START   Capital Leases   Operating Leases  Fiscal Period:   Fiscal 2014  $ 31,694   $ 151,347  Fiscal 2015   12,834    140,249  Fiscal 2016   9,566    131,439  Fiscal 2017   8,764    126,099  Fiscal 2018   3,995    124,329  Thereafter   0    912,952      Total minimum lease payments   66,853   $ 1,586,415     Less: amount representing interest   (4,041 )     Present value of capital lease obligations  $ 62,812      ##TABLE_END The Companys agreements for the facilities and certain services provide the Company with the option to renew. The Companys future contractual obligations would change if the Company exercised these options. The terms of the lease agreements provide for rental payments on a graduated basis. The Company recognizes rent expense on a straight-line basis over the lease period and has accrued for rent expense incurred but not paid. Of the total operating lease commitment balance of $1.6 billion, approximately $1.5 billion is related to facilities space. The remaining commitment amount is related to computer equipment and other leases. Rent expense for fiscal 2013, 2012 and 2011 was $88.3 million, $70.3 million and $52.8 million, respectively. 11. Employee Benefit Plan The Company has a 401(k) plan covering all eligible employees in the United States. Since January 1, 2006, the Company has been contributing to the plan. Total Company contributions during fiscal 2013, 2012 and 2011, were $22.1 million, $15.7 million and $11.0 million, respectively. 12. Legal Proceedings In the ordinary course of business, the Company is involved in various legal proceedings and claims related to alleged infringement of third-party patents and other intellectual property rights, commercial, labor and employment, wage and hour, and other claims. In general, the resolution of a legal matter could prevent the Company from offering its service to others, could be material to the Companys financial condition or cash flows, or both, or could otherwise adversely affect the Companys operating results. The Company makes a provision for a liability relating to legal matters when it is both probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. These provisions are reviewed at least quarterly and adjusted to reflect the impacts of negotiations, estimated settlements, legal rulings, advice  of legal counsel and other information and events pertaining to a particular matter. In managements opinion, resolution of all current matters is not expected to have a material adverse impact on the Companys consolidated results of operations, cash flows or financial position. However, depending on the nature and timing of any such dispute, an unfavorable resolution of a matter could materially affect the Companys future results of operations or cash flows, or both, of a particular quarter. 13. Related-Party Transactions In January 1999, the salesforce.com/foundation, also referred to as the Foundation, a non-profit public charity, was chartered to build philanthropic programs that are focused on youth and technology. The Companys chairman is the chairman of the Foundation. He, two of the Companys employees and one of the Companys board members hold four of the Foundations ten board seats. The Company does not control the Foundations activities, and accordingly, the Company does not consolidate the Foundations statement of activities with its financial results. Since the Foundations inception, the Company has provided at no charge certain resources to Foundation employees such as office space. The value of these items was in excess of $150,000 per quarter during fiscal 2013. In addition to the resource sharing with the Foundation, the Company issued the Foundation warrants in August 2002 to purchase shares of the Companys common stock. All of the warrants were exercised in prior years. As of January 31, 2013, the Foundation held 76,000 shares of salesforce.com common stock. Additionally, the Company has donated subscriptions to the Companys service to other qualified non-profit organizations. The Company also allows an affiliate of the Foundation to resell the Companys service to large non-profit organizations. The Company does not charge the affiliate for the subscriptions and plans to continue these programs. 14. Subsequent Events The Company evaluated subsequent events through the date this Annual Report on Form 10-K was filed with the SEC.  15. Selected Quarterly Financial Data (Unaudited) Selected summarized quarterly financial information for fiscal 2013 and 2012 is as follows: ##TABLE_START   1st Quarter   2nd Quarter   3rd Quarter   4th Quarter   Fiscal Year   (in thousands, except per share data)  Fiscal 2013      Revenues  $ 695,467   $ 731,649   $ 788,398   $ 834,681   $ 3,050,195  Gross profit   543,916    569,231    602,150    651,319    2,366,616  Loss from operations   (22,249 )   (13,466 )   (54,188 )   (20,807 )   (110,710 ) Net loss   (19,475 )   (9,829 )   (220,297 )   (20,844 )   (270,445 ) Basic net loss per share  $ (0.14 )  $ (0.07 )  $ (1.55 )  $ (0.14 )  $ (1.92 ) Diluted net loss per share  $ (0.14 )  $ (0.07 )  $ (1.55 )  $ (0.14 )  $ (1.92 ) Fiscal 2012      Revenues  $ 504,364   $ 546,002   $ 584,260   $ 631,913   $ 2,266,539  Gross profit   401,298    425,092    455,695    495,568    1,777,653  Loss from operations   (2,803 )   (15,748 )   (10,157 )   (6,377 )   (35,085 ) Net income (loss)   530    (4,268 )   (3,756 )   (4,078 )   (11,572 ) Basic net income (loss) per share  $ 0.00   $ (0.03 )  $ (0.03 )  $ (0.03 )  $ (0.09 ) Diluted net income (loss) per share  $ 0.00   $ (0.03 )  $ (0.03 )  $ (0.03 )  $ (0.09 ) ##TABLE_END  ##TABLE_START ", "9A": " ITEM 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES ##TABLE_END (a) Evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act), as of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K. In designing and evaluating our disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any disclosure controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. In addition, the design of disclosure controls and procedures must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and that management is required to apply its judgment in evaluating the benefits of possible controls and procedures relative to their costs. Based on managements evaluation, our chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are designed to, and are effective to, provide assurance at a reasonable level that the information we are required to disclose in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in Securities and Exchange Commission rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. (b) Managements Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f). Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of January 31, 2013 based on the guidelines established in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). Our internal control over financial reporting includes policies and procedures that provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external reporting purposes in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Based on the results of our evaluation, our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of January 31, 2013. We reviewed the results of managements assessment with our Audit Committee. The effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of January 31, 2013 has been audited by Ernst  Young LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in its report which is included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. (c) Changes in internal control over financial reporting There was no change in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended January 31, 2013 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.  (d) Inherent Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls Our management, including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, do not expect that our disclosure controls or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the Company have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty, and that breakdowns can occur because of a simple error or mistake. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people or by management override of the controls. The design of any system of controls also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions; over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or the degree of compliance with policies or procedures may deteriorate. Because of the inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected. ##TABLE_START ", "9B": " ITEM 9B.

The Cloud, Social and Mobile Revolution We believe that the convergence of cloud, social and mobile technologies has created billions of new connections between people and devices and is fundamentally transforming how companies sell, service, market and innovate. Cloud computing has changed the way enterprise business apps are developed and deployed. Organizations no longer need to buy and maintain their own infrastructure of servers, storage and development tools in order to create and run business apps. Instead, companies can gain access to a variety of business apps via an Internet browser or mobile device on an as-needed basis, without the cost and complexity of managing the hardware or software in-house. The broad shift to social networking has transformed the way people collaborate and is accelerating the adoption of technologies that connect people and products through feeds and status updates. There is a significant transition underway from desktops to smartphones and tablets, making it possible for people to get business done right from their mobile devices. And increasingly, customers want to be connected to the products they use. Customers today are connected, empowered and demand a higher level of service and experience. We believe salesforce.com is at the forefront of connecting employees, partners, products and devices in order to help companies connect with their customers in new ways through this next generation of apps, devices and products.

We have built, and continue to invest in, a comprehensive security infrastructure, including firewalls, intrusion detection systems, and encryption for transmissions over the Internet, which we monitor and test on a regular basis. We built and maintain a multi-tenant application architecture that has been designed to enable our service to scale securely, reliably and cost-effectively. Our multi-tenant application architecture maintains the integrity and separation of customer data while still permitting all customers to use the same application functionality simultaneously. Rapid deployment. Our service can be deployed rapidly since our customers do not have to spend time procuring, installing or maintaining the servers, storage, networking equipment, security products, or other infrastructure hardware and software necessary. Ease of integration and configuration. IT professionals are able to integrate and configure our solutions with existing applications quickly and seamlessly. We provide a set of application programming interfaces (APIs) that enable customers and independent software developers to both integrate our  Index to Financial Statements solution with existing third-party, custom, and legacy apps and write their own application services that integrate with our solutions. For example, many of our customers use our Salesforce1 API to move customer-related data from custom-developed and packaged applications into our service on a periodic basis to provide greater visibility into their activities. High levels of user adoption. We have designed our solutions to be intuitive and easy to use. Our solutions contain many tools and features recognizable to users of popular consumer web services, so users are more familiar with our user interface than typical enterprise applications. As a result, our users can often use and gain benefit from our solutions with minimal training. Rapid development of apps using the Salesforce1 Platform. Our customers and third-party developers can develop apps rapidly because of the ease of use and the benefits of a multi-tenant platform. We provide the capability for business users to easily customize our applications to suit their specific needs, and also a variety of programming language support so developers can code complex apps spanning multiple business processes and deliver them to multiple mobile devices. Increased innovation. By providing infrastructure and development environments on demand, we provide developers the opportunity to create new and innovative apps without having to invest in hardware and distribution. A developer with an idea for a new app can log onto our platforms, develop, test and support their system on the Salesforce1 Platform and make the app accessible for a subscription fee to his or her customers. Lower total cost of ownership. We enable customers to achieve significant up-front savings relative to the traditional enterprise software model. Customers benefit from the predictability of their future costs since they generally pay for the service on a per subscriber basis for the term of the subscription contract. Because we deploy all upgrades on our servers, new features and functionality automatically become part of our service on the upgrade release date and therefore benefit all of our customers immediately. Our Strategy Our objective is to deliver solutions that help companies transform the way they sell, service, market and innovate. Not only do we provide enterprise cloud apps, we also provide an enterprise cloud computing platform upon which our customers and partners can build apps. Key elements of our strategy include: Strengthening our solutions. We designed our solutions to easily accommodate new features and functionality. We intend to continue to extend our core solutions with new features and functions and increased security. We also offer advanced editions for an additional subscription fee to customers that require enhanced CRM capabilities. We offer a range of editions to meet our customers CRM requirements. Through our own development, acquisitions and partnerships, we have strengthened and extended our service offerings. We expect to continue to make such investments in the future. Extending distribution into new and high-growth categories. As part of our growth strategy, we are delivering innovative solutions in new and high-growth categories, including marketing and cloud platforms. We are expanding our footprint in these areas to offer new social and mobile cloud innovations to our customers. Expanding relationships with existing customers. We see a significant opportunity to deepen our relationships with our existing customers. As our customers realize the benefits of our service, we aim to upgrade the customer to higher priced editions, extend the duration of the customers contract and sell more subscriptions by targeting additional functional areas and business units within the customer organization, and ultimately pursue enterprise-wide deployments. Pursuing new customers. We believe that our offerings provide significant value for businesses of any size. As a result, we will continue to aggressively target businesses of all sizes in top industries, primarily  Index to Financial Statements through our direct sales force. We have steadily increased and plan to continue to increase the number of direct sales professionals we employ, and we intend to develop additional distribution channels for our service. Reducing attrition. Our goal is to have all of our customers renew their subscriptions at the end of their contractual terms. We run customer success and other related programs in an effort to secure renewals of existing customers. Building our business in top markets globally. We also believe that there is a substantial market opportunity for our service globally. We plan to continue to aggressively market to customers worldwide in our top global markets by recruiting local sales and support professionals and by building partnerships that help us add customers in the largest enterprise software markets around the world. Additionally, we plan to increase data center capacity by opening additional data centers in our top global markets. Encouraging the development of third-party apps on our cloud computing platforms. The Salesforce1 Platform enables existing customers, ISVs and third-party developers to create and deliver cloud apps they have built on our multi-tenant platform. It is a platform on which apps can be created, tested, published, and run. In addition, these apps can be marketed and sold on the AppExchange, our online marketplace for business apps, or sold directly by software vendors. We believe our ecosystem of developers and software vendors will address the business requirements of both current and potential customers. Technology, Development and Operations We deliver our service as a highly scalable, multi-tenant app. We use commercially available hardware and a combination of proprietary and commercially available software to provide our service. We have optimized our service to run on specific databases and operating systems using the tools and platforms best suited to serve our customers rather than providing software that must be written to different hardware, operating system and database platforms, or that depends upon a customers unique systems environment. As part of our business strategy, we periodically acquire companies or technologies, and we incorporate the acquired technologies into our service while maintaining the quality and security standards that are consistent with our brand and reputation. Performance, functional depth and the usability of our service drive our technology decisions and product direction. Our service treats all customers as separate tenants in central applications, databases and other resources. As a result, we are able to spread the cost of delivering our service across our user base. In addition, because we do not have to manage thousands of distinct applications with their own business logic and database schemas, we believe that we can scale our business faster than traditional software vendors. Moreover, we can focus our resources on building new functionality to deliver to our customer base as a whole rather than on maintaining an infrastructure to support each of their distinct applications. Because of our multi-tenant architecture, we are able to provide all of our customers with a solution based on a single version of our apps. Our research and development efforts are focused on improving and enhancing the features, functionality and security of our existing service offerings as well as developing new features, functionality and services. In addition, from time to time we supplement our internal research and development activities with outside development resources and acquired technology. Our customers access our service over the Internet via all of the major Internet browsers and on most major mobile device operating systems. We provide our services to our customers from third-party data center hosting facilities located in the United States and other countries.  Index to Financial Statements Customers We sell to businesses of all sizes. The number of paying subscriptions at each of our customers ranges from one to hundreds of thousands. None of our customers accounted for more than five percent of our revenues in fiscal 2014, 2013, or 2012. Sources of Revenue We derive our revenues primarily from subscription fees for our service. We also derive revenues from premier support, which provides customers with additional support beyond the standard support that is included in the basic subscription fee. We recognize subscription and support revenue ratably over the contract term, beginning on the commencement date of each contract. The majority of our professional services contracts are on a time and materials basis, for which we generally recognize revenue as the services are rendered. Amounts that have been invoiced are recorded in accounts receivable and in deferred revenue or revenue, depending on whether the revenue recognition criteria have been met. Deferred revenue primarily consists of billings or payments received in advance of revenue recognition from subscription services described above and is recognized as the revenue recognition criteria are met. Unbilled deferred revenue represents future billings under our subscription agreements that have not been invoiced and, accordingly, are not recorded in deferred revenue. We generally invoice customers in annual or quarterly installments. Deferred revenue and unbilled deferred revenue are influenced by several factors, including new business seasonality within the year, the specific timing and duration of large customer subscription agreements, the timing and compounding effects of customer renewals, varying billing cycles of subscription agreements, invoice timing, foreign currency fluctuations and new business linearity within the quarter. Sales, Marketing and Customer Support We organize our sales and marketing programs by geographic regions, including the Americas, Europe, and Asia Pacific, which includes Japan. The majority of our revenue from the Americas is attributable to customers in the United States. Approximately 30 percent of our revenue comes from customers outside of the Americas. Direct Sales We sell our services primarily through our direct sales force, which is comprised of telephone sales personnel based in regional hubs, and field sales personnel based in territories close to their customers. Both our telephone sales and field sales personnel are supported by sales representatives, who are primarily responsible for generating qualified sales leads. Our small business, commercial and enterprise account executives focus their efforts on small, mid-size and large enterprises, respectively. Referral and Indirect Sales We have a network of partners who refer sales leads to us and who then assist in selling to these prospects. This network includes global consulting firms, systems integrators and regional partners. In return, we typically pay these partners a fee based on the first-year subscription revenue generated by the customers whom they refer. Also included in this network are ISVs, whom we typically pay a percentage of the subscription revenue generated by their referrals. We continue to invest in developing additional distribution channels for our subscription service.  Index to Financial Statements Marketing Our marketing strategy is to promote our brand and generate demand for our offerings. We use a variety of marketing programs across traditional and social channels to target our prospective and current customers, partners, and developers. Our primary marketing activities include: ##TABLE_START    Press and industry analyst relations to garner third-party validation and generate positive coverage for our company, offerings and value proposition; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    User conferences and events, as well as participation in trade shows and industry events, to create customer and prospect awareness; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    Social marketing and engagement on social channels like Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn and YouTube; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    Search engine marketing and advertising to drive traffic to our Web properties; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    Web site development to engage and educate prospects and generate interest through product information and demonstrations, free trials, case studies, white papers, and marketing collateral; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    Multi-channel marketing campaigns; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    Use of customer testimonials; and ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    Sales tools and field marketing events to enable our sales organization to more effectively convert leads into customers. ##TABLE_END Customer Service and Support Our global customer support group responds to both business and technical inquiries about the use of our products via the web, telephone, email, social networks and other channels. We provide standard customer support during regular business hours at no charge to customers who purchase any of our paying subscription editions. We also offer premier customer support for an additional fee, which includes services such as priority access to technical resources, developer support, and/or system administration. Seasonality Our fourth quarter has historically been our strongest quarter for new business and renewals. For a more detailed discussion, see the Seasonal Nature of Deferred Revenue and Accounts Receivable discussion in Managements Discussion and Analysis. Competition The market for our offerings is highly competitive, rapidly evolving and fragmented, and subject to changing technology, frequent introductions of new products and services, and as we have seen recently, consolidation. Many prospective customers have invested substantial personnel and financial resources to implement and integrate traditional enterprise software into their businesses, and therefore may be reluctant or unwilling to migrate to an enterprise cloud computing application service. Additionally, third party developers may be reluctant to build application services on our platform since they have invested in other competing technology platforms. We compete primarily with vendors of packaged business software and companies offering CRM apps. We also compete with internally developed apps and may encounter competition from enterprise software vendors and online service providers who may develop toolsets and products that allow customers to build new apps that run on the customers current infrastructure or as hosted services. Our current principal competitors include: ##TABLE_START    enterprise software application vendors; ##TABLE_END  Index to Financial Statements ##TABLE_START    cloud computing application service providers; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    software companies that provide their product or service free of charge, and only charge a premium for advanced features and functionality; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    traditional platform development environment companies; and ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    cloud computing development platform companies. ##TABLE_END We believe that as traditional enterprise software application and platform vendors shift more of their focus to cloud computing, they will become a greater competitive threat. Intellectual Property We rely on a combination of trademark, copyright, trade secret and patent laws in the United States and other jurisdictions as well as confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions to protect our proprietary technology and our brands and maintain programs to protect and grow our rights. We also enter into confidentiality and proprietary rights agreements with our employees, consultants and other third parties and control access to software, services, documentation and other proprietary information. Employees As of January 31, 2014, we had more than 13,300 employees. None of our employees in the United States is represented by a labor union, however, for certain foreign subsidiaries, workers councils represent our employees.

", "1A": " ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones facing us. Other events that we do not currently anticipate or that we currently deem immaterial also may affect our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. Risks Related to Our Business and Industry Defects or disruptions in our service could diminish demand for our service and subject us to substantial liability. Because our service is complex and incorporates a variety of hardware and proprietary and third-party software, our service may have errors or defects that could result in unanticipated downtime for our subscribers and harm to our reputation and our business. Internet-based services frequently contain undetected errors when  Index to Financial Statements first introduced or when new versions or enhancements are released. We have from time to time found defects in our service and new errors in our service may be detected in the future. In addition, our customers may use our service in unanticipated ways that may cause a disruption in service for other customers attempting to access their data. As we acquire companies, we may encounter difficulty in incorporating the acquired technologies into our service and maintaining the quality standards that are consistent with our brand and reputation. Since our customers use our service for important aspects of their business, any errors, defects, disruptions in service or other performance problems could hurt our reputation and may damage our customers businesses. As a result, customers could elect to not renew, or delay or withhold payment to us, we could lose future sales or customers may make warranty or other claims against us, which could result in an increase in our provision for doubtful accounts, an increase in collection cycles for accounts receivable or the expense and risk of litigation. Interruptions or delays in service from our third-party data center hosting facilities could impair the delivery of our service and harm our business. We currently serve our customers from third-party data center hosting facilities located in the United States and other countries. Any damage to, or failure of, our systems generally could result in interruptions in our service. Interruptions in our service may reduce our revenue, cause us to issue credits or pay penalties, cause customers to terminate their subscriptions and adversely affect our attrition rates and our ability to attract new customers. Our business will also be harmed if our customers and potential customers believe our service is unreliable. As part of our current disaster recovery arrangements, our production environment and all of our customers data is currently replicated in near real-time in a facility located in the United States. Companies and products added through acquisition may be temporarily served through alternate facilities. We do not control the operation of any of these facilities, and they are vulnerable to damage or interruption from earthquakes, floods, fires, power loss, telecommunications failures and similar events. They may also be subject to break-ins, sabotage, intentional acts of vandalism and similar misconduct. Despite precautions taken at these facilities, the occurrence of a natural disaster or an act of terrorism, a decision to close the facilities without adequate notice or other unanticipated problems at these facilities could result in lengthy interruptions in our service. Even with the disaster recovery arrangements, our service could be interrupted. As we continue to add data centers and add capacity in our existing data centers, we may move or transfer our data and our customers data. Despite precautions taken during this process, any unsuccessful data transfers may impair the delivery of our service. If our security measures are breached and unauthorized access is obtained to a customers data or our data or our IT systems, our service may be perceived as not being secure, customers may curtail or stop using our service and we may incur significant legal and financial exposure and liabilities. Our service involves the storage and transmission of customers proprietary information, and security breaches could expose us to a risk of loss of this information, litigation and possible liability. These security measures may be breached as a result of third-party action, including intentional misconduct by computer hackers, employee error, malfeasance or otherwise and result in someone obtaining unauthorized access to our customers data or our data, including our intellectual property and other confidential business information, or our IT systems. Additionally, third parties may attempt to fraudulently induce employees or customers into disclosing sensitive information such as user names, passwords or other information in order to gain access to our customers data or our data or IT systems. Because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access, or to sabotage systems, change frequently and generally are not recognized until launched against a target, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures. In addition, our customers may authorize third-party technology providers to access their customer data. Because we do not control our customers and third-party technology providers, or the processing of such data by third-party technology providers, we cannot ensure the integrity or security of such transmissions or processing. Malicious third-parties may also conduct attacks designed to temporarily deny customers access to our services. Any security breach  Index to Financial Statements could result in a loss of confidence in the security of our service, damage our reputation, negatively impact our future sales, disrupt our business and lead to legal liability. As we acquire companies or technologies, we may not realize the expected business benefits, the acquisitions could prove difficult to integrate, disrupt our business, dilute stockholder value and adversely affect our operating results and the value of your investment. As part of our business strategy, we periodically make investments in, or acquisitions of, complementary businesses, joint ventures, services and technologies and intellectual property rights, and we expect that we will continue to make such investments and acquisitions in the future. In July 2013, we acquired ExactTarget, our largest acquisition in the companys history. Acquisitions and investments involve numerous risks, including: ##TABLE_START    the potential failure to achieve the expected benefits of the combination or acquisition; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    difficulties in and the cost of integrating operations, technologies, services and personnel; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    diversion of financial and managerial resources from existing operations; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    risk of entering new markets in which we have little or no experience or where competitors may have stronger market positions; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    potential write-offs of acquired assets or investments, and potential financial and credit risks associated with acquired customers; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    potential loss of key employees; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    inability to generate sufficient revenue to offset acquisition or investment costs; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    the inability to maintain relationships with customers and partners of the acquired business; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    the difficulty of transitioning the acquired technology onto our existing platforms and maintaining the security standards consistent with our other services for such technology; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    potential unknown liabilities associated with the acquired businesses; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    unanticipated expenses related to acquired technology and its integration into existing technology; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    negative impact to our results of operations because of the depreciation and amortization of amounts related to acquired intangible assets, fixed assets and deferred compensation, and the loss of acquired deferred revenue and unbilled deferred revenue; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    delays in customer purchases due to uncertainty related to any acquisition; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    the need to implement controls, procedures and policies at the acquired company; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    challenges caused by distance, language and cultural differences; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    in the case of foreign acquisitions, the challenges associated with integrating operations across different cultures and languages and any currency and regulatory risks associated with specific countries; and ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    the tax effects of any such acquisitions. ##TABLE_END In addition, if we finance acquisitions by issuing equity or convertible or other debt securities or loans, our existing stockholders may be diluted, or we could face constraints related to the terms of and repayment obligation related to the incurrence of indebtedness which could affect the market price of our common stock. Further, if we fail to properly evaluate and execute acquisitions or investments, our business and prospects may be seriously harmed and the value of your investment may decline.  Index to Financial Statements Privacy concerns and laws, evolving regulation of cloud computing, cross-border data transfer restrictions and other domestic or foreign regulations may limit the use and adoption of our solutions and adversely affect our business. Regulation related to the provision of services on the Internet is increasing, as federal, state and foreign governments continue to adopt new laws and regulations addressing data privacy and the collection, processing, storage and use of personal information. In some cases foreign data privacy laws and regulations, such as the European Unions Data Protection Directive, and the country-specific regulations that implement that directive, also govern the processing of personal information. Further, laws are increasingly aimed at the use of personal information for marketing purposes, such as the European Unions e-Privacy Directive, and the country-specific regulations that implement that directive. Such laws and regulations are subject to differing interpretations and may be inconsistent among jurisdictions. These and other requirements could reduce demand for our solutions or restrict our ability to store and process data or, in some cases, impact our ability to offer our services and solutions in certain locations. In addition to government activity, privacy advocacy and other industry groups have established or may establish new self-regulatory standards that may place additional burdens on us. Our customers expect us to meet voluntary certification or other standards established by third parties, such as TRUSTe. If we are unable to maintain these certifications or meet these standards, it could adversely affect our ability to provide our solutions to certain customers and could harm our business. The costs of compliance with and other burdens imposed by laws, regulations and standards may limit the use and adoption of our service and reduce overall demand for it, or lead to significant fines, penalties or liabilities for any noncompliance. Furthermore, concerns regarding data privacy may cause our customers customers to resist providing the data necessary to allow our customers to use our service effectively. Even the perception that the privacy of personal information is not satisfactorily protected or does not meet regulatory requirements could inhibit sales of our products or services, and could limit adoption of our cloud-based solutions. Industry-specific regulation is evolving and unfavorable industry-specific laws, regulations or interpretive positions could harm our business. Our customers and potential customers do business in a variety of industries, including financial services, the public sector, healthcare and telecommunications. Regulators in certain industries have adopted and may in the future adopt regulations or interpretive positions regarding the use of cloud computing and other outsourced services. The costs of compliance with, and other burdens imposed by, industry-specific laws, regulations and interpretive positions may limit customers use and adoption of our services and reduce overall demand for our services. For example, some financial services regulators have imposed guidelines for use of cloud computing services that mandate specific controls or require financial services enterprises to obtain regulatory approval prior to outsourcing certain functions. If we are unable to comply with these guidelines or controls, or if our customers are unable to obtain regulatory approval to use our service where required, our business may be harmed. In addition, an inability to satisfy the standards of certain voluntary third-party certification bodies that our customers may expect, such as an attestation of compliance with the Payment Card Industry (PCI) Data Security Standards, may have an adverse impact on our business. If in the future we are unable to achieve or maintain these industry-specific certifications or other requirements or standards relevant to our customers, it may harm our business. In some cases, industry-specific laws, regulations or interpretive positions may also apply directly to us as a service provider. Any failure or perceived failure by us to comply with such requirements could have an adverse impact on our business.  Index to Financial Statements If we experience significant fluctuations in our rate of anticipated growth and fail to balance our expenses with our revenue forecasts, our results could be harmed. Due to the pace of change and innovation in enterprise cloud computing services and the unpredictability of future general economic and financial market conditions, we may not be able to accurately forecast our rate of growth. We plan our expense levels and investment on estimates of future revenue and future anticipated rate of growth. We may not be able to adjust our spending appropriately if the addition of new subscriptions or the renewals of existing subscriptions falls short of our expectations. A portion of our expenses may also be a fixed cost in nature for some minimum amount of time, such as with a data center contract or office lease, so it may not be possible to reduce costs in a timely manner or without the payment of fees to exit certain obligations early. As a result, we expect that our revenues, operating results and cash flows may fluctuate significantly on a quarterly basis. Our recent revenue growth rates may not be sustainable and may decline in the future. We believe that period-to-period comparisons of our revenues, operating results and cash flows may not be meaningful and should not be relied upon as an indication of future performance. We rely on third-party computer hardware and software which could cause errors or failures of our service and may be difficult to replace. We rely on computer hardware purchased or leased and software licensed from third parties in order to offer our service, including database software and hardware from a variety of vendors. Any errors or defects in third-party hardware or software could result in errors or a failure of our service which could harm our business. This hardware and software may not continue to be available at reasonable prices or on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. Any loss of the right to use any of this hardware or software could significantly increase our expenses and otherwise result in delays in the provisioning of our service until equivalent technology is either developed by us, or, if available, is identified, obtained through purchase or license and integrated into our service. Our quarterly results can fluctuate and our stock price and the value of your investment could decline substantially. Our quarterly results are likely to fluctuate. For example, our fiscal fourth quarter has historically been our strongest quarter for new business and renewals. The year-over-year compounding effect of this seasonality in billing patterns and overall new business and renewal activity causes the value of invoices that we generate in the fourth quarter to continually increase in proportion to our billings in the other three quarters of our fiscal year. Additionally, some of the important factors that may cause our revenues, operating results and cash flows to fluctuate from quarter to quarter include: ##TABLE_START    our ability to retain and increase sales to existing customers, attract new customers and satisfy our customers requirements; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    the attrition rates for our service; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    the amount and timing of operating costs and capital expenditures related to the operations and expansion of our business; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    changes in deferred revenue and unbilled deferred revenue balances, which are not reflected in the balance sheet, due to seasonality, the compounding effects of renewals, invoice duration, invoice timing and new business linearity; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    the number of new employees; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    changes in our pricing policies and terms of contracts, whether initiated by us or as a result of competition; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    the cost, timing and management effort for the introduction of new features to our service; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    the costs associated with acquiring new businesses and technologies and the follow-on costs of integration and consolidating the results of acquired businesses; ##TABLE_END  Index to Financial Statements ##TABLE_START    the rate of expansion and productivity of our sales force; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    the length of the sales cycle for our service; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    new product and service introductions by our competitors; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    our success in selling our service to large enterprises; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    variations in the revenue mix of editions of our service; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    technical difficulties or interruptions in our service; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    expenses related to our real estate, our office leases and our data center capacity and expansion; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    changes in foreign currency exchange rates; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    changes in interest rates and our mix of investments, which would impact our return on our investments in cash and marketable securities; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    conditions, particularly sudden changes, in the financial markets have and may continue to impact the value of and access to our investment portfolio; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    changes in the effective tax rates due to changes in the mix of earnings and losses in countries with differing statutory tax rates, certain non-deductible expenses, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities and our ability to utilize them, changes in federal, state or international tax laws including fundamental changes to tax laws applicable to corporate multinationals that may be considered by the United States and many countries in the European Union, changes in accounting principles, changes in judgment from the evaluation of new information that results in a recognition, derecognition or change in measurement of a tax position taken in a prior period, results of tax examinations by the Internal Revenue Service, state and foreign taxing authorities, as well as changes in excess tax benefits related to exercises and vesting of stock-based compensation; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    changes to non-income taxes due to changes in federal, state or international tax laws; changes in taxing jurisdictions administrative interpretations, decisions, policies, and positions; results of tax examinations, settlements or judicial decisions; changes in accounting principles; changes to the business operations, including acquisitions, as well as the evaluation of new information that results in a change to a tax position taken in a prior period; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    our ability to realize benefits from strategic partnerships; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    expenses related to significant, unusual or discrete events which are recorded in the period in which the events occur; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    general economic conditions that may adversely affect either our customers ability or willingness to purchase additional subscriptions or upgrade their service, or delay a prospective customers purchasing decision, or reduce the value of new subscription contracts, or affect attrition rates; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    timing of additional investments in our enterprise cloud computing application and platform services and in our consulting service; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    regulatory compliance costs; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    the timing of customer payments and payment defaults by customers; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    extraordinary expenses such as litigation or other dispute-related settlement payments; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    the impact of new accounting pronouncements; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    equity issuances, including as consideration in acquisitions or due to the conversion of our outstanding convertible notes at the election of the note holders; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    the timing of stock awards to employees and the related adverse financial statement impact of having to expense those stock awards ratably over their vesting schedules; ##TABLE_END  Index to Financial Statements ##TABLE_START    the timing of commission, bonus, and other compensation payments to employees; and ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    the timing of payroll and other withholding tax expenses which is triggered by the payment of bonuses and when employees exercise their vested stock awards. ##TABLE_END Many of these factors are outside of our control, and the occurrence of one or more of them might cause our operating results to vary widely. As such, we believe that quarter-to-quarter comparisons of our revenues, operating results, changes in our deferred revenue and unbilled deferred revenue balances and cash flows may not be meaningful and should not be relied upon as an indication of future performance. Additionally, we may fail to meet or exceed the expectations of securities analysts and investors, and the market price of our common stock could decline. If one or more of the securities analysts who cover us adversely change their recommendation regarding our stock, the market price of our common stock could decline. Moreover, our stock price may be based on expectations, estimates or forecasts of our future performance that may be unrealistic or that may not be met. Further, our stock price may fluctuate based on reporting by the financial media, including television, radio and press reports and blogs. Our efforts to expand our service beyond the CRM market and to develop our existing service in order to keep pace with technological developments may not succeed and may reduce our revenue growth rate and/or harm our business. We derive substantially all of our revenue from subscriptions to our CRM enterprise cloud computing application service, and we expect this will continue for the foreseeable future. The markets for our Salesforce1 ExactTarget Marketing Cloud and Salesforce1 Platform remain relatively new and it is uncertain whether our efforts will ever result in significant revenue for us. Further, the introduction of new services beyond the CRM market may not be successful, and early stage interest and adoption of such new services may not result in long term success or significant revenue for us. Our efforts to expand our service beyond the CRM market may not succeed and may reduce our revenue growth rate. Additionally, if we are unable to develop enhancements to and new features for our existing service or new services that keep pace with rapid technological developments, our business will be harmed. The success of enhancements, new features and services depends on several factors, including the timely completion, introduction and market acceptance of the feature or edition. Failure in this regard may significantly impair our revenue growth. In addition, because our service is designed to operate on a variety of network hardware and software platforms using a standard browser, we will need to continuously modify and enhance our service to keep pace with changes in Internet-related hardware, software, communication, browser and database technologies. We may not be successful in either developing these modifications and enhancements or in bringing them to market timely. Furthermore, uncertainties about the timing and nature of new network platforms or technologies, or modifications to existing platforms or technologies, could increase our research and development or service delivery expenses. Any failure of our service to operate effectively with future network platforms and technologies could reduce the demand for our service, result in customer dissatisfaction and harm our business. Because we recognize revenue from subscriptions for our service over the term of the subscription, downturns or upturns in new business may not be immediately reflected in our operating results. We generally recognize revenue from customers ratably over the terms of their subscription agreements, which are typically 12 to 36 months. As a result, most of the revenue we report in each quarter is the result of subscription agreements entered into during previous quarters. Consequently, a decline in new or renewed subscriptions in any one quarter may not be reflected in our revenue results for that quarter. Any such decline, however, will negatively affect our revenue in future quarters. Accordingly, the effect of significant downturns in sales and market acceptance of our service, and potential changes in our attrition rate may not be fully reflected in our results of operations until future periods. Our subscription model also makes it difficult for us to rapidly increase our revenue through additional sales in any period, as revenue from new customers must be recognized over the applicable subscription term.  Index to Financial Statements We cannot accurately predict subscription renewals or upgrade rates and the impact these rates may have on our future revenue and operating results. Our customers have no obligation to renew their subscriptions for our service after the expiration of their initial subscription period, which is typically 12 to 36 months, and in the normal course of business, some customers have elected not to renew. In addition, our customers may renew for fewer subscriptions, renew for shorter contract lengths, or renew for lower cost editions of our service. We cannot accurately predict attrition rates given our varied customer base of enterprise and small and medium size business customers and the number of multi-year subscription contracts. Our attrition rates may increase or fluctuate as a result of a number of factors, including customer dissatisfaction with our service, customers spending levels, decreases in the number of users at our customers, pricing changes and deteriorating general economic conditions. If our customers do not renew their subscriptions for our service or reduce the number of paying subscriptions at the time of renewal, our revenue will decline and our business will suffer. Our future success also depends in part on our ability to sell additional features and services, more subscriptions or enhanced editions of our service to our current customers. This may also require increasingly sophisticated and costly sales efforts that are targeted at senior management. Similarly, the rate at which our customers purchase new or enhanced services depends on a number of factors, including general economic conditions and that our customers do not react negatively to any price changes related to these additional features and services. If our efforts to upsell to our customers are not successful and negative reaction occurs, our business may suffer. The market in which we participate is intensely competitive, and if we do not compete effectively, our operating results could be harmed. The market for enterprise applications and platform services is highly competitive, rapidly evolving and fragmented, and subject to changing technology, shifting customer needs and frequent introductions of new products and services. We compete primarily with vendors of packaged CRM software and companies offering on-demand CRM applications. We also compete with internally developed applications and face competition from enterprise software vendors and online service providers who may develop toolsets and products that allow customers to build new applications that run on the customers current infrastructure or as hosted services. Our current competitors include: ##TABLE_START    enterprise software application vendors; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    cloud computing application service providers; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    software companies that provide their product or service free of charge, and only charge a premium for advanced features and functionality; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    traditional platform development environment companies; and ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    cloud computing development platform companies. ##TABLE_END Many of our current and potential competitors enjoy substantial competitive advantages, such as greater name recognition, longer operating histories and larger marketing budgets, as well as substantially greater financial, technical and other resources. In addition, many of our current and potential competitors have established marketing relationships and access to larger customer bases, and have major distribution agreements with consultants, system integrators and resellers. As a result, our competitors may be able to respond more quickly and effectively than we can to new or changing opportunities, technologies, standards or customer requirements. Furthermore, because of these advantages, even if our service is more effective than the products that our competitors offer, potential customers might accept competitive products and services in lieu of purchasing our service. For all of these reasons, we may not be able to compete successfully against our current and future competitors.  Index to Financial Statements If the market for our technology delivery model and enterprise cloud computing services develops more slowly than we expect, our business could be harmed. Our success also depends on the willingness of third-party developers to build applications that are complementary to our service. Without the development of these applications, both current and potential customers may not find our service sufficiently attractive. In addition, for those customers who authorize a third-party technology partner access to their data, we do not provide any warranty related to the functionality, security and integrity of the data transmission or processing. Despite contract provisions to protect us, customers may look to us to support and provide warranties for the third-party applications, which may expose us to potential claims, liabilities and obligations for applications we did not develop or sell. Supporting our existing and growing customer base could strain our personnel resources and infrastructure, and if we are unable to scale our operations and increase productivity, we may not be able to successfully implement our business plan. We continue to experience significant growth in our customer base, which has placed a strain on our management, administrative, operational and financial infrastructure. We anticipate that additional investments in our infrastructure, research and development, and real estate spending will be required to scale our operations and increase productivity, to address the needs of our customers, to further develop and enhance our service, to expand into new geographic areas, and to scale with our overall growth. We regularly upgrade and/or replace our various software systems. If the implementations of these new applications are delayed, or if we encounter unforeseen problems with our new systems or in migrating away from our existing applications and systems, our operations and our ability to manage our business could be negatively impacted. Our success will depend in part upon the ability of our senior management to manage our projected growth effectively. To do so, we must continue to increase the productivity of our existing employees and to hire, train and manage new employees as needed. To manage the expected domestic and international growth of our operations and personnel, we will need to continue to improve our operational, financial and management controls, our reporting systems and procedures, and our utilization of real estate. The additional investments we are making will increase our cost base, which will make it more difficult for us to offset any future revenue shortfalls by reducing expenses in the short term. If we fail to successfully scale our operations and increase productivity, we will be unable to execute our business plan. As more of our sales efforts are targeted at larger enterprise customers, our sales cycle may become more time-consuming and expensive, we may encounter pricing pressure and implementation and customization challenges, and we may have to delay revenue recognition for some complex transactions, all of which could harm our business and operating results. As we target more of our sales efforts at larger enterprise customers, we will face greater costs, longer sales cycles and less predictability in completing some of our sales. In this market segment, the customers decision to use our service may be an enterprise-wide decision and, if so, these types of sales would require us to provide greater levels of education regarding the use and benefits of our service, as well as education regarding privacy and data protection laws and regulations to prospective customers with international operations. In addition, larger customers may demand more customization, integration services and features. As a result of these factors, these sales opportunities may require us to devote greater sales support and professional services resources to individual customers, driving up costs and time required to complete sales and diverting our own sales and professional services resources to a smaller number of larger transactions, while potentially requiring us to delay revenue recognition on some of these transactions until the technical or implementation requirements have been met. Professional services may also be performed by a third party or a combination of our own staff and a third party. Our strategy is to work with third parties to increase the breadth of capability and depth of capacity for  Index to Financial Statements delivery of these services to our customers. If a customer is not satisfied with the quality of work performed by us or a third party or with the type of services or solutions delivered, then we could incur additional costs to address the situation, the profitability of that work might be impaired, and the customers dissatisfaction with our services could damage our ability to obtain additional work from that customer. In addition, negative publicity related to our customer relationships, regardless of its accuracy, may further damage our business by affecting our ability to compete for new business with current and prospective customers. Periodic changes to our sales organization can be disruptive and may reduce our rate of growth. We periodically change and make adjustments to our sales organization in response to market opportunities, competitive threats, management changes, product introductions or enhancements, acquisitions, sales performance, increases in sales headcount, cost levels and other internal and external considerations. In the past, these changes sometimes resulted in a temporary lack of focus and reduced productivity; these effects could recur in connection with any future sales changes we might undertake and our rate of revenue growth could be negatively affected. In addition, any significant change to the way we structure our compensation of our sales organization may be disruptive and may affect our revenue growth. Sales to customers outside the United States expose us to risks inherent in international sales. We sell our service throughout the world and are subject to risks and challenges associated with international business. Historically, sales in Europe and Asia Pacific together have represented approximately 30 percent of our total revenues, and we intend to continue to expand our international sales efforts. The risks and challenges associated with sales to customers outside the United States include: ##TABLE_START    localization of our service, including translation into foreign languages and associated expenses; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    laws and business practices favoring local competitors; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    compliance with multiple, conflicting and changing governmental laws and regulations, including employment, tax, privacy, anti-corruption, import/export, antitrust, data protection and industry-specific laws and regulations, including rules related to compliance by our third-party resellers; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    pressure on the creditworthiness of sovereign nations, particularly in Europe, where we have customers and a balance of our cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities. Liquidity issues or political actions by sovereign nations could result in decreased values of these balances; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    regional data privacy laws and other regulatory requirements that apply to outsourced service providers and to the transmission of our customers data across international borders; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    treatment of revenue from international sources and changes to tax codes, including being subject to foreign tax laws and being liable for paying withholding income or other taxes in foreign jurisdictions; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    foreign currency fluctuations and controls; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    different pricing environments; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    different or lesser protection of our intellectual property; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    longer accounts receivable payment cycles and other collection difficulties; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    natural disasters, acts of war, terrorism, pandemics or security breaches; and ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    regional economic and political conditions. ##TABLE_END Any of these factors could negatively impact our business and results of operations. Additionally, our international subscription fees are paid either in U.S. dollars or local currency. As a result, fluctuations in the value of the U.S. dollar and foreign currencies may make our service more expensive for international customers, which could harm our business.  Index to Financial Statements We have been and may in the future be sued by third parties for various claims including alleged infringement of proprietary rights. We are involved in various legal matters arising from the normal course of business activities. These may include claims, suits, government investigations and other proceedings involving alleged infringement of third-party patents and other intellectual property rights, and commercial, corporate and securities, labor and employment, wage and hour, and other matters. The software and Internet industries are characterized by the existence of a large number of patents, trademarks and copyrights and by frequent litigation based on allegations of infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights. We have received in the past and may receive in the future communications from third parties, including practicing entities and non-practicing entities, claiming that we have infringed their intellectual property rights. For example, we received a notice from a large non-practicing entity alleging that we infringed upon certain of its patents. While no litigation was ever filed, in May 2013 we entered into a multi-year license agreement with the non-practicing entity that covered past period and future non-exclusive rights to its intellectual property. In addition, we have been, and may in the future be, sued by third parties for alleged infringement of their claimed proprietary rights. Our technologies may be subject to injunction if they are found to infringe the rights of a third party or we may be required to pay damages, or both. Many of our subscription agreements require us to indemnify our customers for third-party intellectual property infringement claims, which would increase the cost to us of an adverse ruling on such a claim. The outcome of any claims or litigation, regardless of the merits, is inherently uncertain. Any claims and lawsuits, and the disposition of such claims and lawsuits, whether through settlement or licensing discussions, or litigation, could be time-consuming and expensive to resolve, divert management attention from executing our business plan, result in efforts to enjoin our activities, lead to attempts on the part of other parties to pursue similar claims and, in the case of intellectual property claims, require us to change our technology, change our business practices and/or pay monetary damages or enter into short- or long-term royalty or licensing agreements. Any adverse determination related to intellectual property claims or other litigation could prevent us from offering our service to others, could be material to our financial condition or cash flows, or both, or could otherwise adversely affect our operating results. In addition, depending on the nature and timing of any such dispute, an unfavorable resolution of a legal matter could materially affect our future results of operations or cash flows or both. In addition, our exposure to risks associated with various claims, including the use of intellectual property, may be increased as a result of acquisitions of other companies. For example, we may have a lower level of visibility into the development process with respect to intellectual property or the care taken to safeguard against infringement risks with respect to the acquired company or technology. In addition, third parties may make infringement and similar or related claims after we have acquired technology that had not been asserted prior to our acquisition. Any failure to protect our intellectual property rights could impair our ability to protect our proprietary technology and our brand. If we fail to protect our intellectual property rights adequately, our competitors may gain access to our technology, and our business may be harmed. In addition, defending our intellectual property rights may entail significant expense. Any of our patents, trademarks or other intellectual property rights may be challenged by others or invalidated through administrative process or litigation. While we have some U.S. patents and many U.S. and international patent applications pending, we may be unable to obtain patent protection for the technology covered in our patent applications. In addition, our existing patents and any patents issued in the future may not provide us with competitive advantages, or may be successfully challenged by third parties. Furthermore, legal standards relating to the validity, enforceability and scope of protection of intellectual  Index to Financial Statements property rights are uncertain. Effective patent, trademark, copyright and trade secret protection may not be available to us in every country in which our service is available. The laws of some foreign countries may not be as protective of intellectual property rights as those in the U.S., and mechanisms for enforcement of intellectual property rights may be inadequate and we also face proposals to change the scope of protection for some intellectual property rights in the U.S. Also, our involvement in standard setting activity or the need to obtain licenses from others may require us to license our intellectual property. Accordingly, despite our efforts, we may be unable to prevent third parties from using our intellectual property. We may be required to spend significant resources to monitor and protect our intellectual property rights and we may conclude that in at least some instances the benefits of protecting our intellectual property rights may be outweighed by the expense. We may initiate claims or litigation against third parties for infringement of our proprietary rights or to establish the validity of our proprietary rights. Any litigation, whether or not it is resolved in our favor, could result in significant expense to us and divert the efforts of our technical and management personnel. Our continued success depends on our ability to maintain and enhance our brands. We believe that the brand identities we have developed have significantly contributed to the success of our business. Maintaining and enhancing the salesforce.com brand and our other brands are critical to expanding our base of customers, partners and employees. Our brands will depend largely on our ability to remain a technology leader and continue to provide high-quality innovative products, services, and features. In order to maintain and enhance our brands, we may be required to make substantial investments that may later prove to be unsuccessful. If we fail to maintain and enhance our brands, or if we incur excessive expenses in our efforts to do so, our business, operating results and financial condition may be materially and adversely affected. We may lose key members of our management team or development and operations personnel, and may be unable to attract and retain employees we need to support our operations and growth. Our success depends substantially upon the continued services of our executive officers and other key members of management, particularly our Chief Executive Officer. From time to time, there may be changes in our executive management team resulting from the hiring or departure of executives. Such changes in our executive management team may be disruptive to our business. We are also substantially dependent on the continued service of our existing development and operations personnel because of the complexity of our service and technologies. We do not have employment agreements with any of our executive officers, key management, development or operations personnel and they could terminate their employment with us at any time. The loss of one or more of our key employees or groups could seriously harm our business. In the technology industry, there is substantial and continuous competition for engineers with high levels of experience in designing, developing and managing software and Internet-related services, as well as competition for sales executives and operations personnel. We may not be successful in attracting and retaining qualified personnel. We have from time to time experienced, and we expect to continue to experience, difficulty in hiring and retaining highly skilled employees with appropriate qualifications. If we fail to attract new personnel or fail to retain and motivate our current personnel, our business and future growth prospects could be severely harmed. Any failure in our delivery of high-quality technical support services may adversely affect our relationships with our customers and our financial results. Our customers depend on our support organization to resolve technical issues relating to our applications. We may be unable to respond quickly enough to accommodate short-term increases in customer demand for support services. Increased customer demand for these services, without corresponding revenues, could increase costs and adversely affect our operating results. In addition, our sales process is highly dependent on our applications and business reputation and on positive recommendations from our existing customers. Any failure to maintain high-quality technical support, or a market perception that we do not maintain high-quality support, could adversely affect our reputation, our ability to sell our enterprise cloud computing solutions to existing and prospective customers, and our business, operating results and financial position.  Index to Financial Statements We expect to incur net GAAP losses in the future. We have incurred net losses in each fiscal quarter except one since July 31, 2011. In addition, we expect our costs to increase as a result of decisions made for our long-term benefit, such as equity awards and business combinations. If our revenue does not grow to offset these expected increased costs, we will not be able to return to profitability and we may continue to incur net losses, on a U.S. GAAP basis, in the future. Our debt service obligations may adversely affect our financial condition and cash flows from operations. We have a higher level of debt compared to historical periods, including our outstanding $575.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 0.75% Senior Notes due January 15, 2015, $1.15 billion in aggregate principal amount of 0.25% Senior Notes due April 1, 2018, $300.0 million term loan maturing in July 2016 with Bank of America, N.A. and certain other lenders and capital lease arrangements in excess of $500.0 million. Our maintenance of this indebtedness could have important consequences because: ##TABLE_START    it may impair our ability to obtain additional financing in the future for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, general corporate or other purposes; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    an increased portion of our cash flows from operations may have to be dedicated towards repaying the principal beginning in 2015 or earlier if necessary; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    it may make us more vulnerable to downturns in our business, our industry or the economy in general; and ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    limitations within the term loan covenants may restrict our ability to incur additional indebtedness, grant liens, merge or consolidate, dispose of assets, make investments, make acquisitions, enter into transactions with affiliates, pay dividends or make distributions, repurchase stock and enter into restrictive agreements, as defined in the credit agreement. ##TABLE_END Our ability to meet our expenses and debt obligations will depend on our future performance, which will be affected by financial, business, economic, regulatory and other factors. We will not be able to control many of these factors, such as economic conditions and governmental regulations. Our operations may not generate sufficient cash to enable us to service our debt. If we fail to make a payment on our debt, we could be in default on such debt. If we are at any time unable to generate sufficient cash flows from operations to service our indebtedness when payment is due, we may be required to attempt to renegotiate the terms of the instruments relating to the indebtedness, seek to refinance all or a portion of the indebtedness or obtain additional financing. There can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully renegotiate such terms, that any such refinancing would be possible or that any additional financing could be obtained on terms that are favorable or acceptable to us. A failure to comply with the covenants and other provisions of our outstanding debt could result in events of default under such instruments, which could permit acceleration of all of our notes and the term loan. Any required repayment of our notes and/or term loan as a result of a fundamental change or other acceleration would lower our current cash on hand such that we would not have those funds available for use in our business. We may not realize any benefits in connection with our purchase of undeveloped land in San Francisco. If we do not realize any benefits, our financial performance may be negatively impacted. In November 2010, we purchased approximately 14 acres of undeveloped real estate in San Francisco, California, including entitlements and improvements associated with the land. We may not realize any benefits with respect to the purchase of such real estate. During the first quarter of fiscal 2013, we suspended pre-construction activity on the land. If we commence efforts to develop the real estate, we will be required to devote substantial additional resources in the future, which may impact our liquidity and financial flexibility. In the event that we decide to sell this property, the sale price may be less than the recorded value of the land on our consolidated balance sheet, and our financial results may be negatively impacted.  Index to Financial Statements Weakened global economic conditions may adversely affect our industry, business and results of operations. Our overall performance depends in part on worldwide economic conditions. The United States and other key international economies have experienced in the past a downturn in which economic activity was impacted by falling demand for a variety of goods and services, restricted credit, poor liquidity, reduced corporate profitability, volatility in credit, equity and foreign exchange markets, bankruptcies and overall uncertainty with respect to the economy. The European Union continues to face great economic uncertainty which could impact the overall world economy or various other regional economies. These conditions affect the rate of information technology spending and could adversely affect our customers ability or willingness to purchase our enterprise cloud computing services, delay prospective customers purchasing decisions, reduce the value or duration of their subscription contracts, or affect attrition rates, all of which could adversely affect our operating results. Natural disasters and other events beyond our control could materially adversely affect us. Natural disasters or other catastrophic events may cause damage or disruption to our operations, international commerce and the global economy, and thus could have a strong negative effect on us. Our business operations are subject to interruption by natural disasters, fire, power shortages, pandemics and other events beyond our control. Although we maintain crisis management and disaster response plans, such events could make it difficult or impossible for us to deliver our services to our customers, and could decrease demand for our services. The majority of our research and development activities, corporate headquarters, information technology systems, and other critical business operations, are located near major seismic faults in the San Francisco Bay Area. Because we do not carry earthquake insurance for direct quake-related losses, and significant recovery time could be required to resume operations, our financial condition and operating results could be materially adversely affected in the event of a major earthquake or catastrophic event. Risks Relating to Our Convertible Senior Notes and Our Common Stock The market price of our common stock is likely to be volatile and could subject us to litigation. The trading prices of the securities of technology companies have been highly volatile. Accordingly, the market price of our notes and underlying common stock has been and is likely to continue to be subject to wide fluctuations. Factors affecting the market price of our notes and underlying common stock include: ##TABLE_START    variations in our operating results, earnings per share, cash flows from operating activities, deferred revenue and other financial metrics and non-financial metrics, and how those results compare to analyst expectations; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    forward looking guidance to industry and financial analysts related to future revenue and earnings per share; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    changes in the estimates of our operating results or changes in recommendations by securities analysts that elect to follow our common stock; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    announcements of technological innovations, new services or service enhancements, strategic alliances or significant agreements by us or by our competitors; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    announcements by us or by our competitors of mergers or other strategic acquisitions, or rumors of such transactions involving us or our competitors; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    announcements of customer additions and customer cancellations or delays in customer purchases; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    recruitment or departure of key personnel; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    disruptions in our service due to computer hardware, software, network or data center problems; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    the economy as a whole, market conditions in our industry and the industries of our customers; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    trading activity by a limited number of stockholders who together beneficially own a majority of our outstanding common stock; ##TABLE_END  Index to Financial Statements ##TABLE_START    the issuance of shares of common stock by us, whether in connection with an acquisition, a capital raising transaction or upon conversion of some or all of our outstanding convertible senior notes; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    issuance of debt or other convertible securities; and ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    any other factors discussed herein. ##TABLE_END In addition, if the market for technology stocks or the stock market in general experiences uneven investor confidence, the market price of our notes and underlying common stock could decline for reasons unrelated to our business, operating results or financial condition. The market price of our notes and underlying common stock might also decline in reaction to events that affect other companies within, or outside, our industry even if these events do not directly affect us. Some companies that have experienced volatility in the trading price of their stock have been the subject of securities class action litigation. If we are the subject of such litigation, it could result in substantial costs and a diversion of managements attention and resources. We may issue additional shares of our common stock or instruments convertible into shares of our common stock, including in connection with the conversion of the notes, and thereby materially and adversely affect the market price of our common stock and the trading price of the notes. We are not restricted from issuing additional shares of our common stock or other instruments convertible into, or exchangeable or exercisable for, shares of our common stock during the life of the notes. If we issue additional shares of our common stock or instruments convertible into shares of our common stock, it may materially and adversely affect the market price of our common stock and, in turn, the trading price of the notes. In addition, the conversion of some or all of the notes may dilute the ownership interests of existing holders of our common stock, and any sales in the public market of any shares of our common stock issuable upon such conversion of the notes could adversely affect prevailing market price of our common stock. In addition, the anticipated conversion of the notes could depress the market price of our common stock. We may not have the ability to raise the funds necessary to pay the amount of cash due upon conversion of the notes or the fundamental change purchase price due when a holder submits its notes for purchase upon the occurrence of a fundamental change. Upon the occurrence of a fundamental change, holders may require us to purchase, for cash, all or a portion of their notes. In addition, if a holder converts its notes, we will generally pay such holder an amount of cash before delivering to such holder any shares of our common stock. There can be no assurance that we will have sufficient financial resources, or will be able to arrange financing, to pay the fundamental change purchase price if holders submit their notes for purchase by us upon the occurrence of a fundamental change or to pay the amount of cash due if holders surrender their notes for conversion. In addition, agreements governing any future debt may restrict our ability to make each of the required cash payments even if we have sufficient funds to make them. Furthermore, our ability to purchase the notes or to pay cash upon the conversion of the notes may be limited by law or regulatory authority. In addition, if we fail to purchase the notes, to pay interest due on, or to pay the amount of cash due upon conversion, we will be in default under the indenture, which in turn may result in the acceleration of other indebtedness we may then have. If the repayment of the other indebtedness were to be accelerated, we may not have sufficient funds to repay that indebtedness and to purchase the notes or to pay the amount of cash due upon conversion. Our inability to pay for your notes that are tendered for purchase or upon conversion could result in your receiving substantially less than the principal amount of the notes. The fundamental change provisions may delay or prevent an otherwise beneficial takeover attempt of us. The fundamental change purchase rights, will allow holders to require us to purchase all or a portion of their notes upon the occurrence of a fundamental change. The provisions requiring an increase to the conversion rate for conversions in connection with a make-whole fundamental change may in certain circumstances delay or prevent a takeover of us and the removal of incumbent management that might otherwise be beneficial to investors.  Index to Financial Statements The convertible note hedges and warrant transactions may affect the trading price of the notes and the market price of our common stock. We entered into privately negotiated convertible note hedge transactions with the hedge counterparties concurrently with the pricing of the notes. We also entered into privately negotiated warrant transactions with the hedge counterparties. Taken together, the convertible note hedge transactions and the warrant transactions are expected, but not guaranteed, to reduce the potential dilution with respect to our common stock upon conversion of the notes. If, however, the price of our common stock, as measured under the terms of the warrant transactions, exceeds the exercise price of the warrant transactions, the warrant transactions will have a dilutive effect on our earnings per share to the extent that the price of our common stock as measured under the warrant transactions exceeds the strike price of the warrant transactions. The hedge counterparties and their respective affiliates periodically modify their hedge positions from time to time following the pricing of the notes (and are particularly likely to do so during any observation period relating to a conversion of the notes) by entering into or unwinding various over-the-counter derivative transactions with respect to our common stock, and/or by purchasing or selling shares of our common stock or the notes in privately negotiated transactions and/or open market transactions. The effect, if any, of these transactions and activities on the market price of our common stock or the trading price of the notes will depend in part on market conditions and cannot be ascertained at this time. Any of these activities, however, could adversely affect the market price of our common stock and the trading price of the notes. We do not make any representation or prediction as to the direction or magnitude of any potential effect that the transactions described above may have on the price of the notes or our common stock. In addition, we do not make any representation that the counterparties to those transactions will engage in these transactions or activities or that these transactions and activities, once commenced, will not be discontinued without notice; the counterparties or their affiliates may choose to engage in, or discontinue engaging in, any of these transactions or activities with or without notice at any time, and their decisions will be in their sole discretion and not within our control. We are subject to counterparty risk with respect to the convertible note hedge transactions. The hedge counterparties are financial institutions or affiliates of financial institutions, and we will be subject to the risk that these hedge counterparties may default under the convertible note hedge transactions. Our exposure to the credit risk of the hedge counterparties will not be secured by any collateral. If one or more of the hedge counterparties to one or more of our convertible note hedge transactions becomes subject to insolvency proceedings, we will become an unsecured creditor in those proceedings with a claim equal to our exposure at the time under those transactions. Our exposure will depend on many factors but, generally, the increase in our exposure will be correlated to the increase in our stock price and in the volatility of our stock. In addition, upon a default by one of the hedge counterparties, we may suffer adverse tax consequences and dilution with respect to our common stock. We can provide no assurances as to the financial stability or viability of any of the hedge counterparties. Provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws and Delaware law might discourage, delay or prevent a change of control of our company or changes in our management and, therefore, depress the market price of our common stock. Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that could depress the market price of our common stock by acting to discourage, delay or prevent a change in control of our company or changes in our management that the stockholders of our company may deem advantageous. These provisions among other things: ##TABLE_START    permit the board of directors to establish the number of directors; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    provide that directors may only be removed for cause and only with the approval of 66 2/3 percent of our stockholders; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    require super-majority voting to amend some provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws; ##TABLE_END  Index to Financial Statements ##TABLE_START    authorize the issuance of blank check preferred stock that our board could use to implement a stockholder rights plan (also known as a poison pill); ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    eliminate the ability of our stockholders to call special meetings of stockholders; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    prohibit stockholder action by written consent, which requires all stockholder actions to be taken at a meeting of our stockholders; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    provide that the board of directors is expressly authorized to make, alter or repeal our bylaws; and ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    establish advance notice requirements for nominations for election to our board or for proposing matters that can be acted upon by stockholders at annual stockholder meetings. ##TABLE_END In addition, Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law may discourage, delay or prevent a change in control of our company. Section 203 imposes certain restrictions on merger, business combinations and other transactions between us and holders of 15 percent or more of our common stock. In addition, the fundamental change purchase rights applicable to the notes, which will allow note holders to require us to purchase all or a portion of their notes upon the occurrence of a fundamental change, and the provisions requiring an increase to the conversion rate for conversions in connection with a make-whole fundamental change may in certain circumstances delay or prevent a takeover of us and the removal of incumbent management that might otherwise be beneficial to investors. ", "1B": " ITEM 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS None. ", "2": " ITEM 2. PROPERTIES As of January 31, 2014, our executive offices and principal offices for domestic marketing, sales, professional services and development consist of over 1.1 million square feet of leased space in the San Francisco Bay Area. We also lease space in various locations throughout the United States for local sales and professional services personnel. Our foreign subsidiaries lease office space for their operations including local sales and professional services personnel. We also own approximately 14 acres of undeveloped real estate in San Francisco, California, including entitlements and improvements associated with the land. We continue to evaluate our future needs for office facilities space and its options for the undeveloped real estate, which may include selling a portion of or all the real estate holdings, or suspending pre-construction activity for several more years. We believe that our existing facilities and offices are adequate to meet our current requirements. See Note 10, Commitments, in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information about our lease commitments. If we require additional space, we believe that we will be able to obtain such space on acceptable, commercially reasonable terms. ", "3": " ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS In the ordinary course of business, we are involved in various legal proceedings and claims related to alleged infringement of third-party patents and other intellectual property rights, commercial, corporate and securities, labor and employment, wage and hour, and other claims. We have been, and may in the future be, put on notice and/or sued by third parties for alleged infringement of their proprietary rights, including patent infringement. We evaluate all claims and lawsuits with respect to their potential merits, our potential defenses and counterclaims, settlement or litigation potential and the expected effect on us. Our technologies may be subject to injunction if they are found to infringe the rights of a third party. In addition, many of our subscription agreements require us to indemnify our customers for third-party intellectual property infringement claims, which could increase the cost to us of an adverse ruling on such a claim.  Index to Financial Statements The outcome of any claims or litigation, regardless of the merits, is inherently uncertain. Any claims and other lawsuits, and the disposition of such claims and lawsuits, whether through settlement or litigation, could be time-consuming and expensive to resolve, divert our attention from executing our business plan, result in efforts to enjoin our activities, lead to attempts by third parties to seek similar claims and, in the case of intellectual property claims, require us to change our technology, change our business practices and/or pay monetary damages or enter into short- or long-term royalty or licensing agreements. In general, the resolution of a legal matter could prevent us from offering our service to others, could be material to our financial condition or cash flows, or both, or could otherwise adversely affect our operating results. We make a provision for a liability relating to legal matters when it is both probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. These provisions are reviewed at least quarterly and adjusted to reflect the impacts of negotiations, estimated settlements, legal rulings, advice of legal counsel and other information and events pertaining to a particular matter. In our opinion, resolution of all current matters is not expected to have a material adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations, cash flows or financial position. However, depending on the nature and timing of any such dispute, an unfavorable resolution of a matter could materially affect our future results of operations or cash flows, or both, of a particular quarter.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS ##TABLE_END The following discussion contains forward-looking statements, including, without limitation, our expectations and statements regarding our outlook and future revenues, expenses, results of operations, liquidity, plans, strategies and objectives of management and any assumptions underlying any of the foregoing. Our actual results may differ significantly from those projected in the forward-looking statements. Our forward-looking statements and factors that might cause future actual results to differ materially from our recent results or those projected in the forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, those discussed in the section titled Forward-Looking Information and Risk Factors of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Except as required by law, we assume no obligation to update the forward-looking statements or our risk factors for any reason. Overview We are a leading provider of enterprise cloud computing solutions. We were founded on the concept of delivering customer relationship management, or CRM, applications via the Internet, or cloud. We introduced our first CRM solution in February 2000 and we have expanded our offerings with new editions, solutions and enhanced features, through internal development and acquisitions. We sell to businesses of all sizes and in almost every industry worldwide on a subscription basis. Our mission is to help our customers transform themselves into customer companies by empowering them to connect with their customers, partners, employees and products in entirely new ways. Our objective is to deliver solutions to help companies transform the way they sell, service, market and innovate. With our four core servicesSales Cloud, Service Cloud, Marketing Cloud and the Salesforce1 Platformcustomers have the tools they need to build a next generation social front office with our social and mobile cloud technologies. Key elements of our strategy include: ##TABLE_START    strengthening our market-leading solutions; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    extending distribution into high-growth markets; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    expanding relationships with our existing customer base; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    pursuing new customers; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    reducing our attrition rates; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    building our business in top markets globally, which includes building partnerships that help us add customers; and ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    encouraging the development of third-party applications on our cloud computing platforms. ##TABLE_END We believe the factors that will influence our ability to achieve our objectives include: our prospective customers willingness to migrate to enterprise cloud computing services; the availability, performance and security of our service; our ability to continue to release, and gain customer acceptance of, new and improved features; our ability to successfully integrate acquired businesses and technologies; successful customer adoption and utilization of our service; acceptance of our service in markets where we have few customers; the emergence of additional competitors in our market and improved product offerings by existing and new competitors; the location of new data centers; third-party developers willingness to develop applications on our platforms; our ability to attract new personnel and retain and motivate current personnel; and general economic conditions which could affect our customers ability and willingness to purchase our services, delay the customers purchasing decision or affect attrition rates. To address these factors, we will need to, among other things, continue to add substantial numbers of paying subscriptions, upgrade our customers to fully featured versions such as our Unlimited Edition or arrangements such as a Social Enterprise License Agreement, provide high quality technical support to our customers, encourage the development of third-party applications on our platforms and continue to focus on retaining  Index to Financial Statements customers at the time of renewal. Our plans to invest for future growth include the continuation of the expansion of our data center capacity, the hiring of additional personnel, particularly in direct sales, other customer-related areas and research and development, the expansion of domestic and international selling and marketing activities, continuing to develop our brands, the addition of distribution channels, the upgrade of our service offerings, the development of new services, the integration of acquired technologies, the expansion of our Salesforce1 ExactTarget Marketing Cloud and Salesforce1 Platform service offerings and the additions to our global infrastructure to support our growth. We also regularly evaluate acquisitions or investment opportunities in complementary businesses, joint ventures, services and technologies and intellectual property rights in an effort to expand our service offerings. We expect to continue to make such investments and acquisitions in the future and we plan to reinvest a significant portion of our incremental revenue in future periods to grow our business and continue our leadership role in the cloud computing industry. As a result of our aggressive growth plans, specifically our hiring plan and acquisition activities, we have incurred significant expenses from equity awards and amortization of purchased intangibles which have resulted in net losses on a GAAP basis. As we continue with our growth plan, we may continue to have net losses on a GAAP basis. Our typical subscription contract term is 12 to 36 months, although terms range from one to 60 months, so during any fiscal reporting period only a subset of active subscription contracts are available for renewal. We calculate our attrition rates as of the end of each reporting period. We do not calculate the attrition rate for ExactTarget, Inc. (ExactTarget). Our attrition rate was in the high-single digit percentage range as of January 31, 2014, declining from the low-double digit percentage range attrition rate as of January 31, 2013. We expect our attrition rates to continue to decline slowly over time, as we continue to expand our enterprise business and invest in customer success and other related programs. The majority of our subscription and support revenues are derived from subscriptions to our Sales Cloud. We expect marketing and sales costs, which were 53 percent of our total revenues for fiscal 2014 and 53 percent for the same period a year ago, to continue to represent a substantial portion of total revenues in the future as we seek to add and manage more paying customers, and build greater brand awareness. On March 18, 2013, we issued at par value $1.15 billion of 0.25% convertible senior notes due April 1, 2018. In connection with the issuance of the debt, we entered into convertible note hedge transactions that cover the number of shares of our common stock that are underlying the notes. The note hedge transactions are designed, but not guaranteed, to reduce or eliminate the potential economic dilution arising upon conversion. On March 20, 2013, we amended and restated our certificate of incorporation to increase the number of authorized shares of common stock from 400.0 million to 1.6 billion in order to provide for a four-for-one stock split of the common stock effected in the form of a stock dividend. The record date for the stock split was April 3, 2013, and the additional shares were distributed on April 17, 2013. Each stockholder of record on the close of business on the record date received three additional shares of common stock for each share held. All share and per share data presented herein reflect the impact of the increase in authorized shares and the stock split, as appropriate. In June 2013, we entered into a large capital lease agreement for software for a period of nine years, which consists of the contractual term of six years and a renewal option of three years. On July 11, 2013, we entered into a credit agreement which provides for a $300.0 million term loan due on July 11, 2016. All amounts borrowed under the term loan were used to pay a portion of the total purchase price for ExactTarget.  Index to Financial Statements On July 12, 2013, we acquired for cash the outstanding stock of ExactTarget, a leading global provider of cross-channel, digital marketing solutions. We acquired ExactTarget for the assembled workforce, expected synergies and to create a world-class marketing platform across the channels of email, social, mobile and the web. The financial results of ExactTarget are included in our consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisition. The total purchase price for ExactTarget was approximately $2.6 billion. Fiscal Year Our fiscal year ends on January 31. References to fiscal 2014, for example, refer to the fiscal year ending January 31, 2014. Sources of Revenues We derive our revenues from two sources: (1) subscription revenues, which are comprised of subscription fees from customers accessing our enterprise cloud computing services and from customers purchasing additional support beyond the standard support that is included in the basic subscription fees; and (2) related professional services such as process mapping, project management, implementation services and other revenue. Other revenue consists primarily of training fees. Subscription and support revenues accounted for approximately 94 percent of our total revenues for fiscal 2014. Subscription revenues are driven primarily by the number of paying subscribers, varying service types, the price of our service and renewals. We define a customer as a separate and distinct buying entity (e.g., a company, a distinct business unit of a large corporation, a partnership, etc.) that has entered into a contract to access our enterprise cloud computing services. We define a subscription as a unique user account purchased by a customer for use by its employees or other customer-authorized users, and we refer to each such user as a subscriber. The number of paying subscriptions at each of our customers ranges from one to hundreds of thousands. None of our customers accounted for more than five percent of our revenues during fiscal 2014, 2013 and 2012. Subscription and support revenues are recognized ratably over the contract terms beginning on the commencement dates of each contract. The typical subscription and support term is 12 to 36 months, although terms range from one to 60 months. Our subscription and support contracts are non-cancelable, though customers typically have the right to terminate their contracts for cause if we materially fail to perform. We generally invoice our customers in advance, in annual or quarterly installments, and typical payment terms provide that our customers pay us within 30 days of invoice. Amounts that have been invoiced are recorded in accounts receivable and in deferred revenue, or in revenue depending on whether the revenue recognition criteria have been met. In general, we collect our billings in advance of the subscription service period. Professional services and other revenues consist of fees associated with consulting and implementation services and training. Our consulting and implementation engagements are typically billed on a time and materials basis. We also offer a number of training classes on implementing, using and administering our service that are billed on a per person, per class basis. Our typical professional services payment terms provide that our customers pay us within 30 days of invoice. In determining whether professional services can be accounted for separately from subscription and support revenues, we consider a number of factors, which are described in Critical Accounting EstimatesRevenue Recognition below. Seasonal Nature of Deferred Revenue and Accounts Receivable Deferred revenue primarily consists of billings to customers for our subscription service. Over 90 percent of the value of our billings to customers is for our subscription and support service. We generally invoice our customers in either annual or quarterly cycles. Occasionally, we bill customers for their multi-year contract on a single invoice which results in an increase in noncurrent deferred revenue. We typically issue renewal invoices in  Index to Financial Statements advance of the renewal service period, and depending on timing, the initial invoice for the subscription and services contract and the subsequent renewal invoice may occur in different quarters. This may result in an increase in deferred revenue and accounts receivable. There is a disproportionate weighting towards annual billings in the fourth quarter, primarily as a result of large enterprise account buying patterns. Our fourth quarter has historically been our strongest quarter for new business and renewals. Year on year compounding effect of this seasonality in both billing patterns and overall new and renewal business causes the value of invoices that we generate in the fourth quarter for both new business and renewals to increase as a proportion of our total annual billings. Approximately 74 percent of all subscription and support invoices were issued with annual terms during fiscal 2014. Accordingly, the sequential quarterly changes in accounts receivable and the related deferred revenue during the first three quarters of our fiscal year are not necessarily indicative of the billing activity that occurs in the fourth quarter as displayed below: ##TABLE_START (in thousands)  April 30, 2013   July 31, 2013   October 31, 2013   January 31, 2014  Fiscal 2014     Accounts receivable, net  $ 502,609   $ 599,543   $ 604,045   $ 1,360,837  Deferred revenue, current and noncurrent   1,733,160    1,789,648    1,734,619    2,522,115  (in thousands)  April 30, 2012   July 31, 2012   October 31, 2012   January 31, 2013  Fiscal 2013     Accounts receivable, net  $ 371,395   $ 446,917   $ 418,590   $ 872,634  Deferred revenue, current and noncurrent   1,334,716    1,337,184    1,291,703    1,862,995  (in thousands)  April 30, 2011   July 31, 2011   October 31, 2011   January 31, 2012  Fiscal 2012     Accounts receivable, net  $ 270,816   $ 342,397   $ 312,331   $ 683,745  Deferred revenue, current and noncurrent   915,133    935,266    917,821    1,380,295  ##TABLE_END Unbilled Deferred Revenue The deferred revenue balance on our consolidated balance sheet does not represent the total contract value of annual or multi-year, non-cancelable subscription agreements. Unbilled deferred revenue represents future billings under our subscription agreements that have not been invoiced and, accordingly, are not recorded in deferred revenue. Unbilled deferred revenue was approximately $4.5 billion as of January 31, 2014 and approximately $3.5 billion as of January 31, 2013. Also as a result, our typical contract length has grown and is now between 12 and 36 months. We expect that the amount of unbilled deferred revenue will change from quarter to quarter for several reasons, including the specific timing and duration of large customer subscription agreements, varying billing cycles of subscription agreements, the specific timing of customer renewals, foreign currency fluctuations, the timing of when unbilled deferred revenue is to be recognized as revenue, and changes in customer financial circumstances. For multi-year subscription agreements billed annually, the associated unbilled deferred revenue is typically high at the beginning of the contract period, zero just prior to renewal, and increases if the agreement is renewed. Low unbilled deferred revenue attributable to a particular subscription agreement is often associated with an impending renewal and may not be an indicator of the likelihood of renewal or future revenue from such customer. Accordingly, we expect that the amount of aggregate unbilled deferred revenue will change from year-to-year depending in part upon the number and dollar amount of subscription agreements at particular stages in their renewal cycle. Such fluctuations are not a reliable indicator of future revenues. Unbilled deferred revenue does not include minimum revenue commitments from indirect sales channels, as we recognize revenue, deferred revenue, and any unbilled deferred revenue upon sell-through to an end user customer.  Index to Financial Statements Cost of Revenues and Operating Expenses Cost of Revenues. Cost of subscription and support revenues primarily consists of expenses related to hosting our service and providing support, the costs of data center capacity, depreciation or operating lease expense associated with computer equipment and software, allocated overhead and amortization expense associated with capitalized software related to our services and acquired developed technologies. We allocate overhead such as information technology infrastructure, rent and occupancy charges based on headcount. Employee benefit costs and taxes are allocated based upon a percentage of total compensation expense. As such, general overhead expenses are reflected in each cost of revenue and operating expense category. Cost of professional services and other revenues consists primarily of employee-related costs associated with these services, including stock-based expenses, the cost of subcontractors and allocated overhead. The cost of providing professional services is significantly higher as a percentage of the related revenue than for our enterprise cloud computing subscription service due to the direct labor costs and costs of subcontractors. We intend to continue to invest additional resources in our enterprise cloud computing services. For example, we have invested in additional database software and we plan to open additional data centers and expand our current data centers in the future. Additionally, as we acquire new businesses and technologies, the amortization expense associated with this activity will be included in cost of revenues. The timing of these additional expenses will affect our cost of revenues, both in terms of absolute dollars and as a percentage of revenues, in the affected periods. Research and Development . Research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries and related expenses, including stock-based expenses, the costs of our development and test data center and allocated overhead. We continue to focus our research and development efforts on adding new features and services, integrating acquired technologies, increasing the functionality and security and enhancing the ease of use of our enterprise cloud computing services. Our proprietary, scalable and secure multi-tenant architecture enables us to provide all of our customers with a service based on a single version of our application. As a result, we do not have to maintain multiple versions, which enables us to have relatively lower research and development expenses as compared to traditional enterprise software companies. We expect that in the future, research and development expenses will increase in absolute dollars and may increase as a percentage of total revenues as we invest in building the necessary employee and system infrastructure required to support the development of new, and improve existing, technologies and the integration of acquired businesses and technologies. Marketing and Sales. Marketing and sales expenses are our largest cost and consist primarily of salaries and related expenses, including stock-based expenses, for our sales and marketing staff, including commissions, payments to partners, marketing programs and allocated overhead. Marketing programs consist of advertising, events, corporate communications, brand building and product marketing activities. We plan to continue to invest in marketing and sales by expanding our domestic and international selling and marketing activities, building brand awareness, attracting new customers and sponsoring additional marketing events. The timing of these marketing events, such as our annual and largest event, Dreamforce, will affect our marketing costs in a particular quarter. We expect that in the future, marketing and sales expenses will increase in absolute dollars and continue to be our largest cost. General and Administrative. General and administrative expenses consist of salaries and related expenses, including stock-based expenses, for finance and accounting, legal, internal audit, human resources and management information systems personnel, legal costs, professional fees, other corporate expenses and allocated overhead. We expect that in the future, general and administrative expenses will increase in absolute dollars as we invest in our infrastructure and we incur additional employee related costs, professional fees and insurance costs related to the growth of our business and international expansion. We expect general and administrative costs as a percentage of total revenues to either remain flat or decrease for the next several quarters.  Index to Financial Statements Stock-Based Expenses. Our cost of revenues and operating expenses include stock-based expenses related to equity plans for employees and non-employee directors. We recognize our stock-based compensation as an expense in the statement of operations based on their fair values and vesting periods. These charges have been significant in the past and we expect that they will increase as our stock price increases, as we acquire more companies, as we hire more employees and seek to retain existing employees. During fiscal 2014, we recognized stock-based expense of $503.3 million. As of January 31, 2014, the aggregate stock compensation remaining to be amortized to costs and expenses over a weighted-average period of 1.9 years was $1.4 billion. We expect this stock compensation balance to be amortized as follows: $596.3 million during fiscal 2015; $425.9 million during fiscal 2016; $251.0 million during fiscal 2017 and $100.2 million during fiscal 2018. The expected amortization reflects only outstanding stock awards as of January 31, 2014 and assumes no forfeiture activity. We expect to continue to issue stock-based awards to our employees in future periods. Amortization of Purchased Intangibles from Business Combinations . Our cost of revenues and operating expenses include amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets, such as the amortization of the cost associated with an acquired companys research and development efforts, trade names, customer lists and customer relationships. We expect this expense to increase as we acquire more companies. Critical Accounting Estimates Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, costs and expenses, and related disclosures. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates and assumptions. Our actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. We believe that of our significant accounting policies, which are described in Note 1 Summary of Business and Significant Accounting Policies to our consolidated financial statements, the following accounting policies involve a greater degree of judgment and complexity. Accordingly, these are the policies we believe are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our consolidated financial condition and results of operations. Revenue Recognition . We derive our revenues from two sources: (1) subscription revenues, which are comprised of subscription fees from customers accessing our enterprise cloud computing services and from customers purchasing additional support beyond the standard support that is included in the basic subscription fee; and (2) related professional services such as process mapping, project management, implementation services and other revenue. Other revenue consists primarily of training fees. We commence revenue recognition when all of the following conditions are satisfied: ##TABLE_START    there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    the service has been or is being provided to the customer; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    the collection of the fees is reasonably assured; and ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    the amount of fees to be paid by the customer is fixed or determinable. ##TABLE_END Our subscription service arrangements are non-cancelable and do not contain refund-type provisions. Subscription and Support Revenues Subscription and support revenues are recognized ratably over the contract terms beginning on the commencement date of each contract, which is the date our service is made available to customers. Amounts that have been invoiced are recorded in accounts receivable and in deferred revenue or revenue, depending on whether the revenue recognition criteria have been met.  Index to Financial Statements Professional Services and Other Revenues The majority of our professional services contracts are on a time and material basis. When these services are not combined with subscription revenues as a single unit of accounting, as discussed below, these revenues are recognized as the services are rendered for time and material contracts, and when the milestones are achieved and accepted by the customer for fixed price contracts. Training revenues are recognized after the services are performed. Multiple-Deliverable Arrangements We enter into arrangements with multiple-deliverables that generally include multiple subscriptions, premium support, and professional services. If the deliverables have standalone value upon delivery, we account for each deliverable separately. Subscription services have standalone value as such services are often sold separately. In determining whether professional services have standalone value, we consider the following factors for each professional services agreement: availability of the services from other vendors, the nature of the professional services, the timing of when the professional services contract was signed in comparison to the subscription service start date, and the contractual dependence of the subscription service on the customers satisfaction with the professional services work. To date, we have concluded that all of the professional services included in multiple-deliverable arrangements executed have standalone value. Multiple-deliverables included in an arrangement are separated into different units of accounting and the arrangement consideration is allocated to the identified separate units based on a relative selling price hierarchy. We determine the relative selling price for a deliverable based on its vendor-specific objective evidence of selling price (VSOE), if available, or our best estimate of selling price (BESP), if VSOE is not available. We have determined that third-party evidence (TPE) is not a practical alternative due to differences in our service offerings compared to other parties and the availability of relevant third-party pricing information. The amount of revenue allocated to delivered items is limited by contingent revenue, if any. For certain professional services, we have established VSOE as a consistent number of standalone sales of this deliverable have been priced within a reasonably narrow range. We have not established VSOE for our subscription services due to lack of pricing consistency, the introduction of new services and other factors. Accordingly, we use our BESP to determine the relative selling price. We determined BESP by considering our overall pricing objectives and market conditions. Significant pricing practices taken into consideration include our discounting practices, the size and volume of our transactions, the customer demographic, the geographic area where our services are sold, our price lists, our go-to-market strategy, historical standalone sales and contract prices. The determination of BESP is made through consultation with and approval by management, taking into consideration the go-to-market strategy. As our go-to-market strategies evolve, we may modify our pricing practices in the future, which could result in changes in relative selling prices, including both VSOE and BESP. Deferred Revenue. The deferred revenue balance does not represent the total contract value of annual or multi-year, non-cancelable subscription agreements. Deferred revenue primarily consists of billings or payments received in advance of revenue recognition from subscription service described above and is recognized as the revenue recognition criteria are met. We generally invoice customers in annual or quarterly installments. Deferred revenue is influenced by several factors, including seasonality, the compounding effects of renewals, invoice duration, invoice timing and new business linearity within the quarter. Deferred revenue that will be recognized during the succeeding twelve month period is recorded as current deferred revenue and the remaining portion is recorded as noncurrent. Deferred Commissions. We defer commission payments to our direct sales force. The commissions are deferred and amortized to sales expense over the non-cancelable terms of the related subscription contracts with  Index to Financial Statements our customers, which are typically 12 to 36 months. The commission payments, which are paid in full the month after the customers service commences, are a direct and incremental cost of the revenue arrangements. The deferred commission amounts are recoverable through the future revenue streams under the non-cancelable customer contracts. We believe this is the preferable method of accounting as the commission charges are so closely related to the revenue from the non-cancelable customer contracts that they should be recorded as an asset and charged to expense over the same period that the subscription revenue is recognized. During fiscal 2014, we deferred $265.1 million of commission expenditures and we amortized $194.6 million to sales expense. During the same period a year ago, we deferred $232.6 million of commission expenditures and we amortized $154.8 million to sales expense. Deferred commissions on our consolidated balance sheets totaled $324.9 million at January 31, 2014 and $254.4 million at January 31, 2013. Goodwill and Long-Lived Assets . We make estimates, assumptions, and judgments when valuing goodwill and other intangible assets in connection with the initial purchase price allocation of an acquired entity, as well as when evaluating the recoverability of our goodwill and other intangible assets on an ongoing basis. These estimates are based upon a number of factors, including historical experience, market conditions, and information obtained from the management of acquired companies. Critical estimates in valuing certain intangible assets include, but are not limited to, historical and projected customer retention rates, anticipated growth in revenue from the acquired customers and acquired technology, and the expected use of the acquired assets. These factors are also considered in determining the useful life of acquired intangible assets. The amounts and useful lives assigned to identified intangible assets impacts the amount and timing of future amortization expense. The value of our goodwill and intangible assets could be impacted by future adverse changes such as, but not limited to: a substantial decline in our market capitalization; an adverse action or assessment by a regulator; and unanticipated competition. We evaluate and test the recoverability of our goodwill for impairment at least annually during the fourth quarter or more often if and when circumstances indicate that goodwill may not be recoverable. Each period we evaluate the estimated remaining useful life of our intangible assets and whether events or changes in circumstances warrant a revision to the remaining period of amortization. We evaluate long-lived assets, such as property and equipment, and purchased intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable. Such events or changes in circumstances include, but are not limited to, a significant decrease in the fair value of the underlying asset, a significant decrease in the benefits realized from the acquired assets, difficulty and delays in integrating the business or a significant change in the operations of the acquired assets or use of an asset. A long-lived asset is considered impaired if its carrying amount exceeds the estimated future undiscounted cash flows the asset is expected to generate. If a long-lived asset is considered to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized is the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset or asset group. Business Combinations. Accounting for business combinations requires us to make significant estimates and assumptions, especially at the acquisition date with respect to tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed and pre-acquisition contingencies. We use our best estimates and assumptions to accurately assign fair value to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date. Examples of critical estimates in valuing certain of the intangible assets and goodwill we have acquired include but are not limited to: ##TABLE_START    future expected cash flows from subscription and support contracts, professional services contracts, other customer contracts and acquired developed technologies and patents; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    the acquired companys trade name, trademark and existing customer relationship, as well as assumptions about the period of time the acquired trade name and trademark will continue to be used in our offerings; ##TABLE_END  Index to Financial Statements ##TABLE_START    uncertain tax positions and tax related valuation allowances assumed; and ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    discount rates. ##TABLE_END Unanticipated events and circumstances may occur that may affect the accuracy or validity of such assumptions, estimates or actual results. Stock-Based Options and Awards. We recognize the fair value of our stock options and awards on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period of the option or award which is the vesting term of generally four years for stock options and restricted stock awards and one year for shares issued pursuant to our Employee Stock Purchase Plan (ESPP). The fair value of each option or ESPP share or stock purchase right is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. The estimated forfeiture rate applied is based on historical forfeiture rates. We evaluate the forfeiture rates at least annually, or when events or circumstances indicate a change may be needed. This may cause a fluctuation in our stock-based compensation in the period of change. Inputs into the Black-Scholes option pricing model include: ##TABLE_START    The estimated life for the stock options which is estimated based on an actual analysis of expected life. The estimated life for shares issued pursuant to our ESPP is based on the two purchase periods within the 12 month offering period; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    The risk free interest rate which is based on the rate for a U.S. government security with the same estimated life at the time of the option grant and the stock purchase rights; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    The future stock price volatility which is estimated considering both our observed option-implied volatilities and our historical volatility calculations. We believe this is the best estimate of the expected volatility over the expected life of our stock options and stock purchase rights; and ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    The probability of performance conditions that effect the vesting of certain awards being achieved. Expense is only recognized for those shares expected to vest. ##TABLE_END Income Taxes. We use the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on temporary differences between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in the consolidated statements of operations in the period that includes the enactment date. At each of the interim financial reporting periods, we compute our tax provision by applying an estimated annual effective tax rate to year to date ordinary income and adjust the provision for discrete tax items recorded in the same period. The estimated annual effective tax rate at each interim period represents the best estimate based on evaluations of possible future transactions and may be subject to subsequent refinement or revision. Our tax positions are subject to income tax audits by multiple tax jurisdictions throughout the world. We recognize the tax benefit of an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the position is sustainable upon examination by the taxing authority, based on the technical merits. The tax benefit recognized is measured as the largest amount of benefit which is greater than 50 percent likely to be realized upon settlement with the taxing authority. We recognize interest accrued and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in our income tax provision. Valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amounts more likely than not expected to be realized based on the weighting of positive and negative evidence. Future realization of deferred tax assets ultimately depends on the existence of sufficient taxable income of the appropriate character (for example, ordinary income or capital gain) within the carryback or carryforward periods available under the tax law. We regularly review the deferred tax assets for recoverability based on historical taxable income, projected future taxable income, the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences and tax planning strategies. Our judgment regarding future profitability may change due to many  Index to Financial Statements factors, including future market conditions and the ability to successfully execute the business plans and/or tax planning strategies. Should there be a change in the ability to recover deferred tax assets, our tax provision would increase or decrease in the period in which the assessment is changed. Our tax provision could be adversely affected by changes in the mix of earnings and losses in countries with differing statutory tax rates, certain non-deductible expenses, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities and our ability to utilize them, changes in tax laws including fundamental changes to tax laws applicable to corporate multinationals that may be considered by the United States and many countries in the European Union, changes in accounting principles, adverse results of tax examinations as well as changes in excess tax benefits related to exercises and vesting of stock-based compensation that are allocated directly to stockholders equity. Strategic Investments . We report our investments in non-marketable equity and debt securities, which consist of minority equity and debt investments in privately-held companies, at cost or fair value when an event or circumstance indicates an other-than-temporary decline in value has occurred.

To present this information, current and comparative prior period results for entities reporting in currencies other than United States dollars are converted into United States dollars at the weighted average exchange rate for the quarter being compared to for growth rate calculations presented, rather than the actual exchange rates in effect during that period. ##TABLE_START   As of January 31,  (in thousands)  2014   2013  Balance Sheet Data:   Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities  $ 1,321,017   $ 1,758,285  Deferred revenue, current and noncurrent   2,522,115    1,862,995  Principal due on convertible senior notes and term loan   2,003,864    574,890  ##TABLE_END Unbilled deferred revenue was approximately $4.5 billion as of January 31, 2014 and $3.5 billion as of January 31, 2013. Unbilled deferred revenue represents future billings under our non-cancelable subscription agreements that have not been invoiced and, accordingly, are not recorded in deferred revenue. Fiscal Years Ended January 31, 2014 and 2013 Revenues. ##TABLE_START   Fiscal Year Ended January 31,   Variance  (in thousands)  2014   2013   Dollars   Percent  Subscription and support  $ 3,824,542   $ 2,868,808   $ 955,734    33 % Professional services and other   246,461    181,387    65,074    36 %         Total revenues  $ 4,071,003   $ 3,050,195   $ 1,020,808    33 %         ##TABLE_END Total revenues were $4.1 billion for fiscal 2014, compared to $3.1 billion during the same period a year ago, an increase of $1.0 billion, or 33 percent. Subscription and support revenues were $3.8 billion, or 94 percent of total revenues, for fiscal 2014, compared to $2.9 billion, or 94 percent of total revenues, during the same period a year ago, an increase of $955.7 million, or 33 percent. The increase in subscription and support revenues was due almost entirely to volume-driven increases from new customers, upgrades and additional subscriptions from existing customers and a decline in attrition rates as compared to a year ago. We have continued to invest in a variety of customer programs and initiatives, which, along with longer contract durations and increasing enterprise adoption, have helped reduce our attrition rates. The net price per user per month for our three primary offerings, Professional Edition, Enterprise Edition and Unlimited Edition, varies from period to period, but has remained within a consistent range over the past eight quarters. The net price per user per month has not been a significant driver of revenue growth for the periods presented. Professional services and other revenues were $246.5 million, or six percent of total revenues, for fiscal 2014, compared to $181.4 million, or six percent of total revenues, for the same period a year ago, an increase of $65.1 million, or 36 percent. The increase in professional services and other revenues was due primarily to the higher demand for services from an increased number of customers.  Index to Financial Statements Revenues in Europe and Asia Pacific accounted for $1,171.2 million, or 29 percent of total revenues, for fiscal 2014, compared to $926.5 million, or 30 percent of total revenues, during the same period a year ago, an increase of $244.7 million, or 26 percent. The increase in revenues outside of the Americas was the result of the increasing acceptance of our service, our focus on marketing our service internationally and reduced attrition rates. However, the value of the U.S. dollar relative to foreign currencies caused a decrease in U.S. dollar revenues outside of the Americas for fiscal 2014 as compared to the same period a year ago. The foreign currency impact had the effect of decreasing our aggregate revenues by $24.4 million compared to the same period a year ago. Cost of Revenues. ##TABLE_START   Fiscal Year Ended January 31,   Variance Dollars  (in thousands)  2014   2013   Subscription and support  $ 711,880   $ 494,187   $ 217,693  Professional services and other   256,548    189,392    67,156        Total cost of revenues  $ 968,428   $ 683,579   $ 284,849        Percent of total revenues   24 %   22 %  ##TABLE_END Cost of revenues was $968.4 million, or 24 percent of total revenues, for fiscal 2014, compared to $683.6 million, or 22 percent of total revenues, during the same period a year ago, an increase of $284.8 million. The increase in absolute dollars was primarily due to an increase of $102.8 million in employee-related costs, an increase of $48.9 million in service delivery costs, primarily due to our efforts in increasing data center capacity, an increase of $80.4 million in depreciation and amortization expenses, $32.1 million of which related to the amortization of acquired developed technology, an increase of $16.1 million in subcontractor and professional services expense, an increase of $23.1 million in allocated overhead and an increase of $11.9 million in stock-based expenses. We have increased our customer support and professional services headcount by 58 percent since January 31, 2013 to meet the higher demand for services from our customers, of which the majority was due to the acquisition of ExactTarget. In June 2013, we entered into a large capital lease agreement for software for a period of nine years, which consists of the contractual term of six years and a renewal option of three years. A portion of the depreciation expense on this asset was allocated to cost of revenues which is included in the amount above. We expect the costs associated with this software agreement to increase in future fiscal years. We intend to continue to invest additional resources in our enterprise cloud computing services and data center capacity. Additionally, the amortization of purchased intangible assets will increase as we acquire additional businesses and technologies. We also plan to add additional employees in our professional services group to facilitate the adoption of our services. The timing of these expenses will affect our cost of revenues, both in terms of absolute dollars and as a percentage of revenues in future periods. Research and Development. ##TABLE_START   Fiscal Year Ended January 31,   Variance Dollars  (in thousands)  2014   2013   Research and development  $ 623,798   $ 429,479   $ 194,319  Percent of total revenues   15 %   14 %  ##TABLE_END Research and development expenses were $623.8 million, or 15 percent of total revenues, for fiscal 2014, compared to $429.5 million, or 14 percent of total revenues, during the same period a year ago, an increase of $194.3 million. The increase in absolute dollars was due to an increase of $114.9 million in employee-related costs, an increase of $31.1 million in stock-based expenses, an increase of $16.0 million in depreciation and amortization expenses, an increase of $17.2 million in allocated overhead and an increase of $14.8 million in test data lab costs. We increased our research and development headcount by 31 percent since January 31, 2013 in  Index to Financial Statements order to improve and extend our service offerings and develop new technologies. The majority of the increase in headcount was due to the acquisition of ExactTarget. In June 2013, we entered into a large capital lease agreement for software for a period of nine years, which consists of the contractual term of six years and a renewal option of three years. A portion of the depreciation expense on this asset was allocated to research and development which is included in the amount above. We expect the costs associated with this software agreement to increase in future fiscal years. We expect that research and development expenses will increase in absolute dollars and may increase as a percentage of revenues in future periods as we continue to invest in additional employees and technology to support the development of new, and improve existing, technologies and the integration of acquired technologies. Marketing and Sales. ##TABLE_START   Fiscal Year Ended January 31,   Variance Dollars  (in thousands)  2014   2013   Marketing and sales  $ 2,168,132   $ 1,614,026   $ 554,106  Percent of total revenues   53 %   53 %  ##TABLE_END Marketing and sales expenses were $2.2 billion, or 53 percent of total revenues, for fiscal 2014, compared to $1.6 billion, or 53 percent of total revenues, during the same period a year ago, an increase of $554.1 million. The increase in absolute dollars was primarily due to an increase of $357.1 million in employee-related costs, an increase of $59.3 million in stock-based expenses, an increase of $57.2 million in advertising, marketing and event costs and an increase of $49.8 million in allocated overhead. Our marketing and sales headcount increased by 33 percent since January 31, 2013. The increase in headcount was primarily attributable to the hiring of additional sales personnel to focus on adding new customers and increasing penetration within our existing customer base, while a portion of the increase was due to the acquisition of ExactTarget. General and Administrative. ##TABLE_START   Fiscal Year Ended January 31,   Variance Dollars  (in thousands)  2014   2013   General and administrative  $ 596,719   $ 433,821   $ 162,898  Percent of total revenues   15 %   15 %  ##TABLE_END General and administrative expenses were $596.7 million, or 15 percent of total revenues, for fiscal 2014, compared to $433.8 million, or 15 percent of total revenues, during the same period a year ago, an increase of $162.9 million. The increase was primarily due to an increase of $70.6 million in employee-related costs, an increase of $21.7 million in stock-based expenses, an increase of $48.3 million in professional and outside services, which included transaction fees associated with the ExactTarget acquisition, and an increase in depreciation and amortization expense. Our general and administrative headcount increased by 28 percent since January 31, 2013 as we added personnel to support our growth. The majority of the increase in headcount was due to the acquisition of ExactTarget. Loss from operations. ##TABLE_START   Fiscal Year Ended January 31,   Variance Dollars  (in thousands)  2014   2013   Loss from operations  $ (286,074 )  $ (110,710 )  $ (175,364 ) Percent of total revenues   (7 )%   (4 )%  ##TABLE_END Loss from operations for fiscal 2014, was $286.1 million and included $503.3 million of stock-based expenses and $146.5 million of amortization of purchased intangibles. During the same period a year ago, operating loss was $110.7 million and included $379.4 million of stock-based expenses and $88.2 million of amortization of purchased intangibles.

Investment income was $10.2 million for fiscal 2014, and was $19.6 million during the same period a year ago. The decrease was primarily due to the decrease in marketable securities balances. Interest expense. ##TABLE_START   Fiscal Year Ended January 31,   Variance Dollars  (in thousands)  2014   2013   Interest expense  $ (77,211 )  $ (30,948 )  $ (46,263 ) Percent of total revenues   (2 )%   (1 )%  ##TABLE_END Interest expense consists of interest on our convertible senior notes, term loan and capital leases. Interest expense, net of interest costs capitalized, was $77.2 million for fiscal 2014 and was $30.9 million during the same period a year ago. The increase was primarily due to interest expense associated with the March 2013 issuance of $1.15 billion of 0.25% convertible senior notes, the $300.0 million term loan that was entered into in connection with the acquisition of ExactTarget and the large capital lease agreement for software which we entered into in June 2013. Benefit from (provision for) Income Taxes. ##TABLE_START   Fiscal Year Ended January 31,   Variance Dollars  (in thousands)  2014   2013   Benefit from (provision for) income taxes  $ 125,760   $ (142,651 )  $ 268,411  Effective tax rate   35 %   (112 )%  ##TABLE_END We reported a tax benefit of $125.8 million with a pretax loss of $357.9 million, which resulted in an effective tax rate of 35 percent for fiscal 2014. Due to the ExactTarget acquisition, a deferred tax liability was established for the book-tax basis difference related to purchased intangibles. The net deferred tax liability from acquisitions provided an additional source of income to support the realizability of our pre-existing deferred tax assets and as a result, we released a portion of the valuation allowance that was established in the previous year and recorded a tax benefit of $143.1 million for fiscal 2014. We recorded a tax provision of $142.7 million on a pretax loss of $127.8 million, which resulted in a negative effective tax rate of 112 percent for fiscal 2013. Our effective tax rate substantially differed from the federal statutory tax rate of 35 percent primarily due to the tax charge of $186.8 million to establish a valuation allowance for a significant portion of our deferred tax assets. We regularly assess the need for a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets by considering both positive and negative evidence related to the likelihood of the realization of the deferred tax assets to determine if it is more-likely-than-not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will be realized. In our evaluation, we considered our cumulative loss in recent years and our forecasted future losses as significant pieces of negative evidence. During fiscal 2013, we determined that the negative evidence outweighed the positive evidence and a  Index to Financial Statements valuation allowance for a significant portion of our deferred tax assets was established that resulted in a tax expense of $186.8 million. We will continue to assess the realizability of the deferred tax assets in each of the applicable jurisdictions going forward and adjust the valuation allowance accordingly. Due to the valuation allowance, the effective tax rate could be volatile and is therefore difficult to forecast in future periods. See Note 8 Income Taxes to the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for our reconciliation of income taxes at the statutory federal rate to the provision for income taxes.

Subscription and support revenues were $2.9 billion, or 94 percent of total revenues, for fiscal 2013, compared to $2.1 billion, or 94 percent of total revenues, during fiscal 2012. The increase in subscription and support revenues was due primarily to new customers, upgrades and additional subscriptions from existing customers and improved renewal rates as compared to a year ago. During fiscal 2013, we continued to invest in a variety of customer programs and initiatives which, along with longer contract durations and increasing enterprise adoption, have helped improve our renewal rates. The price per user per month for our three primary offerings, Professional Edition, Enterprise Edition and Unlimited Edition, in fiscal 2013 has generally remained consistent relative to prior periods. Professional services and other revenues were $181.4 million, or six percent of total revenues, for fiscal 2013, compared to $140.3 million, or six percent of total revenues, for fiscal 2012. The increase in professional services and other revenues was due primarily to the higher demand for services from an increased number of customers. Revenues in Europe and Asia Pacific accounted for $926.5 million, or 30 percent of total revenues, for fiscal 2013, compared to $726.3 million, or 32 percent of total revenues, during fiscal 2012, an increase of $200.2 million, or 28 percent. The increase in revenues outside of the Americas was the result of the increasing acceptance of our service, our focus on marketing our services internationally and improved renewal rates as a result of the reasons stated above. Revenues outside of the Americas increased despite an overall strengthening of the U.S. dollar relative to major international currencies, which reduced aggregate international revenues by $43.9 million compared to fiscal 2012.

Our marketing and sales headcount increased by 25 percent since January 31, 2012 as we hired additional sales personnel to focus on adding new customers and increasing penetration within our existing customer base.

The increase was primarily due to an increase of $56.2 million in employee-related costs and an increase of $19.8 million in stock-based expenses. Our general and administrative headcount increased by 15 percent since January 31, 2012 as we added personnel to support our growth.

Investment income was $19.6 million during fiscal 2013 and was $23.3 million during fiscal 2012. The decrease was primarily due to lower yields and interest rates on our portfolio compared to fiscal 2012.

Interest expense, net of interest costs capitalized, was $30.9 million during fiscal 2013 and was $17.0 million during fiscal 2012. During fiscal 2013, we capitalized $2.4 million of interest costs related to capital projects. Capitalized interest during fiscal 2012 was $14.6 million. During the first quarter of fiscal 2013, we suspended pre-construction activity, which includes capitalized interest costs, on the undeveloped real estate in San Francisco, California resulting in an increase in interest expense as compared to fiscal 2012. Benefit from (provision for) income taxes. ##TABLE_START   Fiscal Year Ended January 31,   Variance Dollars  (in thousands)  2013   2012   Benefit from (provision for) income taxes  $ (142,651 )  $ 21,745   $ (164,396 ) Effective tax rate   (112 )%   65 %  ##TABLE_END We recorded a tax provision of $142.7 million during fiscal 2013, which resulted in a negative effective tax rate of 112 percent. The effective tax rate substantially differed from the federal statutory tax rate of 35 percent primarily due to the tax charge of $186.8 million to establish a valuation allowance for a significant portion of our deferred tax assets.  Index to Financial Statements We regularly assess the need for a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets by considering both positive and negative evidence related to the likelihood of the realization of the deferred tax assets to determine if it is more-likely-than-not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will be realized. In our evaluation, we considered our cumulative loss in recent years and our forecasted future losses as significant pieces of negative evidence. During fiscal 2013, we determined that the negative evidence outweighed the positive evidence and a valuation allowance for a significant portion of our deferred tax assets was established that resulted in a tax expense of $186.8 million. We recorded a tax benefit of $21.7 million during fiscal 2012, which resulted in an effective tax rate of 65 percent. The effective tax rate was higher than the federal statutory tax rate of 35 percent primarily due to federal and California tax credits and the impact of the Radian6 acquisition. The combined effect of these tax benefits was partially offset by foreign tax expense and non-deductible amounts. The effect on the tax rate was magnified because of the relatively small pre-tax loss. Liquidity and Capital Resources At January 31, 2014, our principal sources of liquidity were cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaling $1.3 billion and accounts receivable of $1.4 billion. Net cash provided by operating activities was $875.5 million during fiscal 2014 and $736.9 million during the same period a year ago. Cash provided by operating activities has historically been affected by: the amount of net loss adjusted for non-cash expense items such as depreciation and amortization, amortization of purchased intangibles from business combinations, amortization of debt discount, and the expense associated with stock-based awards; the reclassification of excess tax benefits from employee stock plans to cash flows from financing activities; the timing of employee related costs including commissions and bonus payments; the timing of collections from our customers, which is our largest source of operating cash flows; and changes in working capital accounts. Our working capital accounts consist of accounts receivables and prepaid assets and other current assets. Claims against working capital include accounts payable, accrued expenses and other current liabilities and our convertible notes. Our working capital may be impacted by factors in future periods, certain amounts and timing of which are seasonal, such as billings to customers for subscriptions and support services and the subsequent collection of those billings. As described above in Seasonal Nature of Deferred Revenue and Accounts Receivable, our fourth quarter has historically been our strongest quarter for new business and renewals. The year on year compounding effect of this seasonality in both billing patterns and overall business causes the value of invoices that we generate in the fourth quarter to increase as a proportion of our total annual billings. We generally invoice our customers for our subscription and services contracts in advance in annual or quarterly installments. We typically issue renewal invoices in advance of the renewal service period, and depending on timing, the initial invoice for the subscription and services contract and the subsequent renewal invoice may occur in different quarters. Such invoice amounts are initially reflected in accounts receivable and deferred revenue, which is reflected on the balance sheet. The operating cash flow benefit of increased billing activity generally occurs in the subsequent quarter when we collect from our customers. Net cash provided by operating activities during fiscal 2014 increased $138.6 million over the same period a year ago primarily due to higher net income after adjusting for depreciation and amortization and stock-based compensation. During fiscal 2014, $8.1 million of excess tax benefits from employee stock plans was reclassified to cash flows from financing activities, as compared to $14.9 million during the same period a year ago. The increase in net cash in fiscal 2014 was partially offset by certain unfavorable changes in working capital accounts, primarily an increase in accounts receivables and a decrease in accounts payable, accrued expenses  Index to Financial Statements and other liabilities. Net cash provided by operating activities was also impacted by approximately $30.0 million of payments made for the transaction fees incurred by ExactTarget and us related to the acquisition. Net cash used in investing activities was $2.4 billion during fiscal 2014 and $938.9 million during the same period a year ago. The net cash used in investing activities during fiscal 2014 primarily related to the acquisition of EdgeSpring, Inc. (EdgeSpring) in June 2013, the acquisition of ExactTarget in July 2013, capital expenditures, including new office build-outs and a new intellectual property licensing agreement, investment of cash balances and strategic investments offset by proceeds from sales and maturities of marketable securities. Net cash provided by financing activities was $1.6 billion during fiscal 2014 and $334.5 million during the same period a year ago. Net cash provided by financing activities during fiscal 2014 consisted primarily of $1.1 billion of proceeds from the issuance of convertible senior notes, $84.8 million from proceeds from the issuance of warrants, $298.5 million of proceeds from the term loan, net of loan fees, and $289.9 million from proceeds from employee-related equity plans offset by $153.8 million for the purchase of hedges on the convertible note, $41.1 million of principal payments on capital leases and $15.0 million of principal payments on the term loan. In July 2013, we entered into a credit agreement (the Credit Agreement) with Bank of America, N.A. and certain other lenders, which provides for a $300.0 million term loan (the Term Loan) that matures on July 11, 2016 (the Maturity Date). The Term Loan bears interest at our option under either a LIBOR-based formula or a base rate formula, each as set forth in the Credit Agreement. The Credit Agreement contains certain customary affirmative and negative covenants, including a consolidated leverage ratio covenant, a consolidated interest coverage ratio covenant, a limit on our ability to incur additional indebtedness, issue preferred stock or pay dividends, and certain other restrictions on our activities as defined in the Credit Agreement. We were in compliance with the Credit Agreements covenants as of January 31, 2014. The weighted average interest rate on the Term Loan was 2.0% for fiscal 2014. As of January 31 2014, the amount outstanding under the Term Loan was $285.0 million. Accrued interest on the Term Loan was $0.5 million as of January 31, 2014. During fiscal 2014, payments totaling $15.0 million were made on the Term Loan and subsequent payments of $7.5 million are due quarterly thereafter until the maturity date in July 2016 when the remaining outstanding principal amount is due. In January 2010, we issued $575.0 million of 0.75% convertible senior notes due January 15, 2015 (the 0.75% Senior Notes) and concurrently entered into convertible notes hedges (the 0.75% Note Hedges) and separate warrant transactions (the 0.75% Warrants). The 0.75% Senior Notes will mature on January 15, 2015, unless earlier converted. Upon conversion of any 0.75% Senior Notes, we will deliver cash up to the principal amount of the 0.75% Senior Notes and, with respect to any excess conversion value greater than the principal amount of the 0.75% Senior Notes, shares of our common stock, cash, or a combination of both. For the 20 trading days during the 30 consecutive trading days ended October 31, 2013, our common stock traded at a price exceeding 130% of the conversion price of $21.34 per share applicable to the 0.75% Senior Notes. Accordingly, the 0.75% Senior Notes were convertible at the holders option for the quarter ending January 31, 2014. For the 20 trading days during the 30 consecutive trading days ended January 31, 2014, our common stock traded at a price exceeding 130% of the conversion price of $21.34 per share applicable to the 0.75% Senior Notes. Accordingly, the 0.75% Senior Notes are convertible at the holders option for the quarter ending April 30, 2014. As the 0.75% Senior Notes are due on January 15, 2015, they are classified as a current liability on our consolidated balance sheet as of January 31, 2014. During the quarter ending April 30, 2014, we will repay in cash an aggregate principal balance of at least $280.0 million related to conversion requests of our 0.75% Senior Notes received through the date of the filing of  Index to Financial Statements this Form 10-K. The excess of the conversion value that is greater than the principal amount will be delivered in shares of our common stock for the majority of the conversion requests received to date. If our stock price continues to exceed the conversion price of our 0.75% Senior Notes, we may continue to see conversion requests on the 0.75% Senior Notes during fiscal 2015. In March 2013, we issued $1.15 billion of 0.25% convertible senior notes due April 1, 2018 (the 0.25% Senior Notes) and concurrently entered into convertible notes hedges (the 0.25% Note Hedges) and separate warrant transactions (the 0.25% Warrants). The 0.25% Senior Notes will mature on April 1, 2018, unless earlier converted. Upon conversion of any 0.25% Senior Notes, we will deliver cash up to the principal amount of the 0.25% Senior Notes and, with respect to any excess conversion value greater than the principal amount of the 0.25% Senior Notes, shares of our common stock, cash, or a combination of both. The 0.25% Senior Notes will be convertible if during any 20 trading days during the 30 consecutive trading days of any fiscal quarter commencing after April 30, 2013, our common stock trades at a price exceeding 130% of the conversion price of $66.44 per share applicable to the 0.25% Senior Notes. The 0.25% Senior Notes have not yet been convertible at the holders option. The 0.25% Senior Notes are classified as a noncurrent liability on our consolidated balance sheet as of January 31, 2014. For 20 trading days during the 30 consecutive trading days ended January 31, 2014, our common stock did not trade at a price exceeding 130% of the conversion price of $66.44 per share applicable to the 0.25% Senior Notes. Accordingly, the 0.25% Senior Notes will not be convertible at the holders option for the quarter ending April 30, 2014, and will remain classified as a noncurrent liability on our consolidated balance sheet. Our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities are comprised primarily of corporate notes and other obligations, U.S. treasury securities, U.S. agency obligations, government obligations, collateralized mortgage obligations, mortgage backed securities, time deposits, money market mutual funds and municipal securities. As of January 31, 2014, we have a total of $55.4 million in letters of credit outstanding in favor of certain landlords for office space. To date, no amounts have been drawn against the letters of credit, which renew annually and expire at various dates through December 2030. We do not have any special purpose entities, and other than operating leases for office space and computer equipment, we do not engage in off-balance sheet financing arrangements. Our principal commitments consist of obligations under leases for office space and co-location facilities for data center capacity and our development and test data center, and computer equipment and software and furniture and fixtures. At January 31, 2014, the future non-cancelable minimum payments under these commitments were as follows: ##TABLE_START (in thousands) Contractual Obligations  Payments Due by Period   Total   Less than 1 Year   1-3 Years   3-5 Years   More than 5 Years  Capital lease obligations  $ 606,505   $ 77,455   $ 146,038   $ 183,012   $ 200,000  Operating lease obligations:      Facilities space   1,280,872    144,568    300,105    248,671    587,528  Computer equipment and furniture and fixtures   102,208    51,946    50,173    89    0  Convertible Senior Notes, including interest   1,733,842    573,875    5,750    1,154,217    0  Term loan   285,000    30,000    255,000    0    0  Financing obligation   335,824    0    18,654    42,658    274,512  Contractual commitments   5,950    5,950    0    0    0             $ 4,350,201   $ 883,794   $ 775,720   $ 1,628,647   $ 1,062,040            ##TABLE_END   Index to Financial Statements The majority of our operating lease agreements provide us with the option to renew. Our future operating lease obligations would change if we exercised these options and if we entered into additional operating lease agreements as we expand our operations. The Financing Obligation above represents the total obligation for our lease of approximately 445,000 rentable square feet of office space in San Francisco, California. As of January 31, 2014, $40.2 million of the total obligation noted above was recorded to Financing obligation, building in progressleased facility, which is included in Other noncurrent liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets. During fiscal 2014 and in future fiscal years, we have made and expect to continue to make additional investments in our infrastructure to scale our operations and increase productivity. We plan to upgrade and/or replace various internal systems to scale with the overall growth of the Company. Additionally, we expect capital expenditures to be higher in absolute dollars and remain consistent as a percentage of total revenues in future periods as a result of continued office build-outs, other leasehold improvements and data center investments. In the future, we may enter into arrangements to acquire or invest in complementary businesses or joint ventures, services and technologies, and intellectual property rights. We may be required to seek additional equity or debt financing. Additional funds may not be available on terms favorable to us or at all. We believe our existing cash, cash equivalents and short-term marketable securities and cash provided by operating activities will be sufficient to meet our working capital, capital expenditure and debt repayment needs over the next 12 months. Non-GAAP Financial Measures Regulation S-K Item 10(e), Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures in Commission Filings, defines and prescribes the conditions for use of non-GAAP financial information. Our measures of non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP operating profit, non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP earnings per share each meet the definition of a non-GAAP financial measure. Non-GAAP gross profit, Non-GAAP operating profit and Non-GAAP net income We use the non-GAAP measures of non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP operating profit and non-GAAP net income to provide an additional view of operational performance by excluding non-cash expenses that are not directly related to performance in any particular period. In addition to our GAAP measures we use these non-GAAP measures when planning, monitoring, and evaluating our performance. We believe that these non-GAAP measures reflect our ongoing business in a manner that allows for meaningful period-to-period comparisons and analysis of trends in our business, as they exclude certain expenses and benefits. These items are excluded because the decisions which gave rise to them are not made to increase revenue in a particular period, but are made for our long-term benefit over multiple periods and we are not able to change or affect these items in any particular period. We define non-GAAP net income as our total net income excluding the following components, which we believe are not reflective of our ongoing operational expenses. In each case, for the reasons set forth below, we believe that excluding the component provides useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating the impact of certain non-cash items to our operating results and future prospects in the same manner as us, in comparing financial results across accounting periods and to those of peer companies and to better understand the impact of these non-cash items on our gross margin and operating performance. Additionally, as significant, unusual or discrete events occur, the results may be excluded in the period in which the events occur. ##TABLE_START    Stock-Based Expenses . The Companys compensation strategy includes the use of stock-based compensation to attract and retain employees and executives. It is principally aimed at aligning their interests with those of our stockholders and at long-term employee retention, rather than to motivate or reward operational performance for any particular period. Thus, stock-based compensation expense varies for reasons that are generally unrelated to operational decisions and performance in any particular period. ##TABLE_END  Index to Financial Statements ##TABLE_START    Amortization of Purchased Intangibles. The Company views amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets, such as the amortization of the cost associated with an acquired companys research and development efforts, trade names, customer lists and customer relationships, as items arising from pre-acquisition activities determined at the time of an acquisition. While it is continually viewed for impairment, amortization of the cost of purchased intangibles is a static expense, one that is not typically affected by operations during any particular period. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    Amortization of Debt Discount. Under GAAP, certain convertible debt instruments that may be settled in cash (or other assets) on conversion are required to be separately accounted for as liability (debt) and equity (conversion option) components of the instrument in a manner that reflects the issuers non-convertible debt borrowing rate. Accordingly, for GAAP purposes we are required to recognize imputed interest expense on the Companys $575.0 million of convertible senior notes that were issued in a private placement in January 2010 and the Companys $1.15 billion of convertible senior notes that were issued in a private placement in March 2013. The imputed interest rates were approximately 5.9% for the notes issued in January 2010 and approximately 2.5% for the notes issued in March 2013, while the coupon interest rates were 0.75% and 0.25%, respectively. The difference between the imputed interest expense and the coupon interest expense, net of the interest amount capitalized, is excluded from managements assessment of the Companys operating performance because management believes that this non-cash expense is not indicative of ongoing operating performance. Management believes that the exclusion of the non-cash interest expense provides investors an enhanced view of the Companys operational performance. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    Income Tax Effects and Adjustments . The Companys non-GAAP tax provision excludes the tax effects of expense items described above and certain tax items not directly related to the current fiscal years ordinary operating results. Examples of such tax items include, but are not limited to, changes in the valuation allowance related to deferred tax assets, certain acquisition-related costs and unusual or infrequently occurring items. Management believes the exclusion of these income tax adjustments provides investors with useful supplemental information about the Companys operational performance. ##TABLE_END We define non-GAAP gross profit as our total revenues less cost of revenues, as reported on our consolidated statement of operations, excluding the portions of stock-based expenses and amortization of purchased intangibles that are included in cost of revenues. We define non-GAAP operating profit as our non-GAAP gross profit less operating expenses, as reported on our consolidated statement of operations, excluding the portions of stock-based expenses and amortization of purchased intangibles that are included in operating expenses. Non-GAAP earnings per share Management uses the non-GAAP earnings per share to provide an additional view of performance by excluding items that are not directly related to performance in any particular period in the earnings per share calculation. We define non-GAAP earnings per share as our non-GAAP net income, which excludes the above components, which we believe are not reflective of our ongoing operational expenses, divided by basic or diluted shares outstanding. Limitations on the use of Non-GAAP financial measures A limitation of our non-GAAP financial measures of non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP operating profit, non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP earnings per share is that they do not have uniform definitions. Our definitions will likely differ from the definitions used by other companies, including peer companies, and therefore comparability may be limited. Thus, our non-GAAP measures of non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP  Index to Financial Statements operating profit, non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP earnings per share should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, or in isolation from, measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. Additionally, in the case of stock-based expense, if we did not pay a portion of compensation in the form of stock-based expense, the cash salary expense included in costs of revenues and operating expenses would be higher which would affect our cash position. We compensate for these limitations by reconciling non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP operating profit, non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP earnings per share to the most comparable GAAP financial measure. We encourage investors and others to review our financial information in its entirety, not to rely on any single financial measure and to view our non-GAAP financial measures in conjunction with the most comparable GAAP financial measures. Our reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures of gross profit, operating profit, net income and earnings per share to the most comparable GAAP measure, gross profit, loss from operations, net loss and Net loss per share for the years ended January 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012 are as follows (in thousands, except for share numbers): ##TABLE_START   For the Year Ended January 31,  Non-GAAP gross profit  2014   2013   2012  GAAP gross profit  $ 3,102,575   $ 2,366,616   $ 1,777,653  Plus:    Amortization of purchased intangibles   109,356    77,249    60,069  Stock-based expenses   45,608    33,757    17,451        Non-GAAP gross profit  $ 3,257,539   $ 2,477,622   $ 1,855,173          For the Year Ended January 31,  Non-GAAP operating profit  2014   2013   2012  GAAP loss from operations  $ (286,074 )  $ (110,710 )  $ (35,085 ) Plus:    Amortization of purchased intangibles   146,535    88,171    67,319  Stock-based expenses   503,280    379,350    229,258        Non-GAAP operating profit  $ 363,741   $ 356,811   $ 261,492          For the Year Ended January 31,  Non-GAAP net income  2014   2013   2012  GAAP net loss  $ (232,175 )  $ (270,445 )  $ (11,572 ) Plus:    Amortization of purchased intangibles   146,535    88,171    67,319  Stock-based expenses   503,280    379,350    229,258  Amortization of debt discount, net   46,942    23,837    12,335  Less:    Income tax effects and adjustments of Non-GAAP items   (242,729 )   21,629    (103,730 )       Non-GAAP net income  $ 221,853   $ 242,542   $ 193,610        ##TABLE_END  Index to Financial Statements ##TABLE_START   For the Year Ended January 31,  Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share(a)  2014   2013   2012  GAAP diluted loss per share  $ (0.39 )  $ (0.48 )  $ (0.02 ) Plus:    Amortization of purchased intangibles   0.23    0.15    0.12  Stock-based expenses   0.79    0.64    0.40  Amortization of debt discount, net   0.07    0.04    0.02  Less:    Income tax effects and adjustments of Non-GAAP items   (0.35 )   0.06    (0.18 )       Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share  $ 0.35   $ 0.41   $ 0.34        Shares used in computing diluted net income per share   635,688    596,280    569,180  ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START (a) Prior period results have been adjusted to reflect the four-for-one stock split of our common stock through a stock dividend which occurred in April 2013. ##TABLE_END The effects of dilutive securities were not included in the GAAP calculation of diluted earnings/loss per share for the years ended January 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012 because we had a net loss for those periods and the effect would have been anti-dilutive.

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK ##TABLE_END Foreign Currency Exchange Risk Our results of operations and cash flows are subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates, particularly changes in the Euro, British Pound Sterling, Canadian Dollar and Japanese Yen. We seek to minimize the impact of certain foreign currency fluctuations by hedging certain balance sheet exposures with foreign currency forward contracts. Any gain or loss from settling these contracts is offset by the loss or gain derived from the underlying balance sheet exposures. In accordance with our policy, the hedging contracts we enter into have maturities of less than three months. Additionally, by policy, we do not enter into any hedging contracts for trading or speculative purposes. Interest Rate Sensitivity We had cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaling $1.3 billion at January 31, 2014. This amount was invested primarily in money market funds, time deposits, corporate notes and bonds, government securities and other debt securities with credit ratings of at least triple BBB or better. The cash, cash equivalents and short-term marketable securities are held for general corporate purposes including possible acquisitions of, or investments in, complementary businesses, services or technologies, working capital and capital expenditures. Our investments are made for capital preservation purposes. We do not enter into investments for trading or speculative purposes. Our cash equivalents and our portfolio of marketable securities are subject to market risk due to changes in interest rates. Fixed rate securities may have their market value adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates, while floating rate securities may produce less income than expected if interest rates fall. Due in part to these factors, our future investment income may fall short of expectation due to changes in interest rates or we may suffer losses in principal if we are forced to sell securities that decline in market value due to changes in interest rates. However because we classify our debt securities as available for sale, no gains or losses are recognized due to changes in interest rates unless such securities are sold prior to maturity or declines in fair value are determined to be other-than-temporary. Our fixed-income portfolio is subject to interest rate risk. An immediate increase or decrease in interest rates of 100-basis points at January 31, 2014 could result in a $8.8 million market value reduction or increase of the same amount. This estimate is based on a sensitivity model that measures market value changes when changes in interest rates occur. Fluctuations in the value of our investment securities caused by a change in interest rates (gains or losses on the carrying value) are recorded in other comprehensive income, and are realized only if we sell the underlying securities. At January 31, 2013, we had cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaling $1.8 billion. The fixed-income portfolio was also subject to interest rate risk. Changes in interest rates of 100-basis points would have resulted in market value changes of $16.7 million. Market Risk and Market Interest Risk In January 2010, we issued at par value $575.0 million of 0.75% convertible senior notes due 2015 (the 0.75% Senior Notes) and in March 2013, we issued at par value $1.15 billion of 0.25% convertible senior notes (the 0.25% Senior Notes) (collectively the Notes). Holders may convert the Notes prior to maturity upon the occurrence of certain circumstances. Upon conversion, we would pay the holder an amount of cash equal to the principal amounts of the Notes. Amounts in excess of the principal amounts of the Notes, if any, may be paid in cash or stock at our option. Concurrent with the issuance of the Notes, we entered into separate note hedging transactions and the sale of warrants. These separate transactions were completed to reduce the potential economic dilution from the conversion of the Notes. The 0.75% Senior Notes and the 0.25% Senior Notes have fixed annual interest rates of 0.75% and 0.25%, respectively and therefore, we do not have economic interest rate exposure on the Notes. However, the value of  Index to Financial Statements the Notes are exposed to interest rate risk. Generally, the fair values of our fixed interest rate Notes will increase as interest rates fall and decrease as interest rates rise. In addition, the fair values of our Notes is affected by our stock price. The carrying value of our 0.75% Senior Notes was $542.2 million and the carrying value of our 0.25% Senior Notes was $1.0 billion as of January 31, 2014, which represents the liability components of the $568.9 million principal balance and $1.15 billion principal balance, respectively. The total estimated fair values of our 0.75% Senior Notes and 0.25% Senior Notes at January 31, 2014 were $1.6 billion and $1.3 billion, respectively. The fair value was determined based on the closing trading price per $100 of the 0.75% Senior Notes and 0.25% Senior Notes as of the last day of trading for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014, which were $283.78 and $115.29, respectively. In July 2013, we entered into a $300.0 million term loan (the Term Loan) which matures in July 2016 and bears interest at our option of either a base rate plus a spread of 0.50% to 1.00% or an adjusted LIBOR rate as defined in the Credit Agreement plus a spread of 1.50% to 2.00%. The Company entered into the Term Loan for purposes of partially funding the acquisition of ExactTarget. Interest is due and payable in arrears quarterly for the loan bearing interest as described above at the end of an interest period. The Term Loan is payable in quarterly installments equal to $7.5 million beginning in September 2013, with the remaining outstanding principal amount of the term loan being due and payable at maturity. By entering into the Term Loan, we have assumed risks associated with variable interest rates based upon a variable base rate or LIBOR. The weighted average interest rate on the Term Loan was 2.0% for fiscal 2014. Changes in the overall level of interest rates affect the interest expense that we recognize in our statements of operations. We have an investment portfolio that includes strategic investments in public and privately-held companies, many of which are in the development stage. When our ownership interests are less than 20 percent and we do not have the ability to exert significant influence, we account for investments in non-marketable equity and debt securities of the privately-held companies using the cost method of accounting. Otherwise, we account for the investments using the equity method of accounting. As of January 31, 2014 and January 31, 2013 the fair value of our investments in privately-held companies was $77.0 million and $46.8 million, respectively.

Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the companys internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. A companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. As indicated in the accompanying Managements Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting, managements assessment of and conclusion on the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting did not include the internal controls of ExactTarget, Inc., which is included in the January 31, 2014 consolidated financial statements of salesforce.com, inc. and constituted less than four percent and less than six percent, respectively, of consolidated total assets and consolidated net assets, excluding acquisition method fair value adjustments as of January 31, 2014, and less than five percent of consolidated total revenues for the year then ended.

Index to Financial Statements salesforce.com, inc. Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements 1. Summary of Business and Significant Accounting Policies Description of Business Salesforce.com, inc. (the Company) is a provider of enterprise cloud computing services. The Company is dedicated to helping customers of all sizes and industries worldwide transform themselves into customer companies by empowering them to connect with their customers in entirely new ways. With four core service offerings, the Sales Cloud, the Service Cloud, the Marketing Cloud and the Salesforce1 Platform, the Company provides a next generation customer platform. Fiscal Year The Companys fiscal year ends on January 31. References to fiscal 2014, for example, refer to the fiscal year ending January 31, 2014. Basis of Presentation On March 20, 2013, the Companys certificate of incorporation was amended to increase the number of authorized shares of common stock from 400.0 million to 1.6 billion in order to provide for a four-for-one stock split of the common stock effected in the form of a stock dividend. The record date for the stock split was April 3, 2013, and the additional shares were distributed on April 17, 2013. Each stockholder of record on the close of business on the record date received three additional shares of common stock for each share held. All share and per share data presented herein reflect the impact of the increase in authorized shares and the stock split, as appropriate. Use of Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions in the Companys consolidated financial statements and notes thereto. Significant estimates and assumptions made by management include the determination of: ##TABLE_START    the best estimate of selling price of the deliverables included in multiple-deliverable revenue arrangements, ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed for business combinations, ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    the recognition, measurement and valuation of current and deferred income taxes, ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    the recognition and measurement of loss contingencies, ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    the estimate of real estate sublease rental rates and market conditions, ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    the fair value of the convertible notes, ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    the fair value of stock awards issued and related forfeiture rates, ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    the valuation of strategic investments and the determination of other-than-temporary impairments, and ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    the assessment of recoverability of long-lived assets (property and equipment, goodwill and identified intangibles). ##TABLE_END Actual results could differ materially from those estimates.  Index to Financial Statements Principles of Consolidation The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. Segments The Company operates as one operating segment. Operating segments are defined as components of an enterprise for which separate financial information is evaluated regularly by the chief operating decision maker, who is the chief executive officer, in deciding how to allocate resources and assessing performance. Over the past few years, the Company has completed several acquisitions. These acquisitions have allowed the Company to expand its offerings, presence and reach in various market segments of the enterprise cloud computing market. While the Company has offerings in multiple enterprise cloud computing market segments, the Companys business operates in one operating segment because the Companys chief operating decision maker evaluates the Companys financial information and resources and assesses the performance of these resources on a consolidated basis. Since the Company operates in one operating segment, all required financial segment information can be found in the consolidated financial statements. Concentrations of Credit Risk and Significant Customers The Companys financial instruments that are exposed to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities and trade accounts receivable. Although the Company deposits its cash with multiple financial institutions, its deposits, at times, may exceed federally insured limits. Collateral is not required for accounts receivable. The Company maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts receivable balances. The allowance is based upon historical loss patterns, the number of days that billings are past due and an evaluation of the potential risk of loss associated with delinquent accounts. No customer accounted for more than five percent of accounts receivable at January 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. No single customer accounted for five percent or more of total revenue during fiscal 2014, 2013, and 2012. Geographic Locations As of January 31, 2014 and 2013, assets located outside the Americas were 12 percent and 16 percent of total assets, respectively. Revenues by geographical region are as follows (in thousands): ##TABLE_START   Fiscal Year Ended January 31,    2014   2013   2012  Americas  $ 2,899,837   $ 2,123,736   $ 1,540,289  Europe   741,220    525,304    408,456  Asia Pacific   429,946    401,155    317,794         $ 4,071,003   $ 3,050,195   $ 2,266,539        ##TABLE_END Americas revenue attributed to the United States was approximately 96 percent, 94 percent and 93 percent in fiscal 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. Revenue Recognition The Company derives its revenues from two sources: (1) subscription revenues, which are comprised of subscription fees from customers accessing the Companys enterprise cloud computing services and from  Index to Financial Statements customers purchasing additional support beyond the standard support that is included in the basic subscription fees; and (2) related professional services such as process mapping, project management, implementation services and other revenue. Other revenue consists primarily of training fees. The Company commences revenue recognition when all of the following conditions are satisfied: ##TABLE_START    there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    the service has been or is being provided to the customer; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    the collection of the fees is reasonably assured; and ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    the amount of fees to be paid by the customer is fixed or determinable. ##TABLE_END The Companys subscription service arrangements are non-cancelable and do not contain refund-type provisions. Subscription and Support Revenues Subscription and support revenues are recognized ratably over the contract terms beginning on the commencement date of each contract, which is the date the Companys service is made available to customers. Amounts that have been invoiced are recorded in accounts receivable and in deferred revenue or revenue, depending on whether the revenue recognition criteria have been met. Professional Services and Other Revenues The majority of the Companys professional services contracts are on a time and material basis. When these services are not combined with subscription revenues as a single unit of accounting, as discussed below, these revenues are recognized as the services are rendered for time and material contracts, and when the milestones are achieved and accepted by the customer for fixed price contracts. Training revenues are recognized as the services are performed. Multiple-Deliverable Arrangements The Company enters into arrangements with multiple-deliverables that generally include multiple subscriptions, premium support and professional services. If the deliverables have standalone value upon delivery, the Company accounts for each deliverable separately. Subscription services have standalone value as such services are often sold separately. In determining whether professional services have standalone value, the Company considers the following factors for each professional services agreement: availability of the services from other vendors, the nature of the professional services, the timing of when the professional services contract was signed in comparison to the subscription service start date and the contractual dependence of the subscription service on the customers satisfaction with the professional services work. To date, the Company has concluded that all of the professional services included in multiple-deliverable arrangements executed have standalone value. Multiple-deliverables included in an arrangement are separated into different units of accounting and the arrangement consideration is allocated to the identified separate units based on a relative selling price hierarchy. The Company determines the relative selling price for a deliverable based on its vendor-specific objective evidence of selling price (VSOE), if available, or its best estimate of selling price (BESP), if VSOE is not available. The Company has determined that third-party evidence of selling price (TPE) is not a practical alternative due to differences in its service offerings compared to other parties and the availability of relevant third-party pricing information. The amount of revenue allocated to delivered items is limited by contingent revenue, if any.  Index to Financial Statements For certain professional services, the Company has established VSOE as a consistent number of standalone sales of this deliverable have been priced within a reasonably narrow range. The Company has not established VSOE for its subscription services due to lack of pricing consistency, the introduction of new services and other factors. Accordingly, the Company uses its BESP to determine the relative selling price. The Company determined BESP by considering its overall pricing objectives and market conditions. Significant pricing practices taken into consideration include the Companys discounting practices, the size and volume of the Companys transactions, the customer demographic, the geographic area where services are sold, price lists, its go-to-market strategy, historical standalone sales and contract prices. The determination of BESP is made through consultation with and approval by the Companys management, taking into consideration the go-to-market strategy. As the Companys go-to-market strategies evolve, the Company may modify its pricing practices in the future, which could result in changes in relative selling prices, including both VSOE and BESP. Deferred Revenue The deferred revenue balance does not represent the total contract value of annual or multi-year, non-cancelable subscription agreements. Deferred revenue primarily consists of billings or payments received in advance of revenue recognition from subscription services described above and is recognized as the revenue recognition criteria are met. The Company generally invoices customers in annual or quarterly installments. Deferred revenue is influenced by several factors, including seasonality, the compounding effects of renewals, invoice duration, invoice timing and new business linearity within the quarter. Deferred revenue that will be recognized during the succeeding twelve month period is recorded as current deferred revenue and the remaining portion is recorded as noncurrent. Deferred Commissions Deferred commissions are the incremental costs that are directly associated with non-cancelable subscription contracts with customers and consist of sales commissions paid to the Companys direct sales force. The commissions are deferred and amortized over the non-cancelable terms of the related customer contracts, which are typically 12 to 36 months. The commission payments are paid in full the month after the customers service commences. The deferred commission amounts are recoverable through the future revenue streams under the non-cancelable customer contracts. The Company believes this is the preferable method of accounting as the commission charges are so closely related to the revenue from the non-cancelable customer contracts that they should be recorded as an asset and charged to expense over the same period that the subscription revenue is recognized. Amortization of deferred commissions is included in marketing and sales expense in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations. Cash and Cash Equivalents The Company considers all highly liquid investments purchased with an original maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents. Cash and cash equivalents are stated at fair value. Marketable Securities Management determines the appropriate classification of marketable securities at the time of purchase and reevaluates such determination at each balance sheet date. Securities are classified as available for sale and are carried at fair value, with the change in unrealized gains and losses, net of tax, reported as a separate component on the consolidated statements of comprehensive loss. Fair value is determined based on quoted market rates when observable or utilizing data points that are observable, such as quoted prices, interest rates and yield curves. Declines in fair value judged to be other-than-temporary on securities available for sale are included as a  Index to Financial Statements component of investment income. In order to determine whether a decline in value is other-than-temporary, the Company evaluates, among other factors: the duration and extent to which the fair value has been less than the carrying value and its intent and ability to retain the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in fair value. The cost of securities sold is based on the specific-identification method. Interest on securities classified as available for sale is also included as a component of investment income. Fair Value Measurement The Company measures its cash equivalents, marketable securities and foreign currency derivative contracts at fair value. The additional disclosures regarding the Companys fair value measurements are included in Note 2, Investments. Property and Equipment Property and equipment are stated at cost. Depreciation is calculated on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of those assets as follows: ##TABLE_START Computer, equipment and software  3 to 9 years Furniture and fixtures  5 years Leasehold improvements  Shorter of the lease term or 10 years Building improvements  Amortized over the estimated useful lives of the respective assets when they are ready for their intended use ##TABLE_END When assets are retired or otherwise disposed of, the cost and accumulated depreciation and amortization are removed from their respective accounts and any loss on such retirement is reflected in operating expenses. Capitalized Internal-Use Software Costs The Company capitalizes costs related to its enterprise cloud computing services and certain projects for internal use incurred during the application development stage. Costs related to preliminary project activities and post implementation activities are expensed as incurred. Internal-use software is amortized on a straight line basis over its estimated useful life. Management evaluates the useful lives of these assets on an annual basis and tests for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances occur that could impact the recoverability of these assets. Goodwill, Intangible Assets, Long-Lived Assets and Impairment Assessments The Company evaluates and tests the recoverability of its goodwill for impairment at least annually during the fourth quarter or more often if and when circumstances indicate that goodwill may not be recoverable. Intangible assets are amortized over their useful lives. Each period the Company evaluates the estimated remaining useful life of its intangible assets and whether events or changes in circumstances warrant a revision to the remaining period of amortization. The carrying amounts of these assets are periodically reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of these assets may not be recoverable. Recoverability of these assets is measured by comparison of the carrying amount of each asset to the future undiscounted cash flows the asset is expected to generate. If the undiscounted cash flows used in the test for recoverability are less than the carrying amount of these assets then the carrying amount of such assets is reduced to fair value.  Index to Financial Statements The Company evaluates the recoverability of its long-lived assets for possible impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable. If such review indicates that the carrying amount of long-lived assets is not recoverable, the carrying amount of such assets is reduced to fair value. Business Combinations The Company uses its best estimates and assumptions to accurately assign fair value to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date. The Companys estimates are inherently uncertain and subject to refinement. During the measurement period, which may be up to one year from the acquisition date, the Company may record adjustments to the fair value of these tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed, with the corresponding offset to goodwill. In addition, uncertain tax positions and tax-related valuation allowances are initially established in connection with a business combination as of the acquisition date. The Company continues to collect information and reevaluates these estimates and assumptions quarterly and records any adjustments to the Companys preliminary estimates to goodwill provided that the Company is within the measurement period. Upon the conclusion of the measurement period or final determination of the fair value of assets acquired or liabilities assumed, whichever comes first, any subsequent adjustments are recorded to the Companys consolidated statements of operations. Leases and Asset Retirement Obligations The Company categorizes leases at their inception as either operating or capital leases. On certain lease agreements, the Company may receive rent holidays and other incentives. The Company recognizes lease costs on a straight-line basis once control of the space is achieved, without regard to deferred payment terms, such as rent holidays that defer the commencement date of required payments. Additionally, incentives received are treated as a reduction of costs over the term of the agreement. The Company establishes assets and liabilities for the present value of estimated future costs to retire long-lived assets at the termination or expiration of a lease. Such assets are depreciated over the lease period into operating expense, and the recorded liabilities are accreted to the future value of the estimated retirement costs. The Company records assets and liabilities for the estimated construction costs incurred under build-to-suit lease arrangements to the extent it is involved in the construction of structural improvements or takes construction risk prior to commencement of a lease. The Company will continue to account for the facility as a financing obligation upon completion of the construction project. Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation The Company recognizes stock-based expenses related to stock options and restricted stock awards on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period of the awards, which is generally the vesting term of four years. The Company recognizes stock-based expenses related to shares issued pursuant to its 2004 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (ESPP) on a straight-line basis over the offering period, which is 12 months. Stock-based expenses are recognized net of estimated forfeiture activity. The estimated forfeiture rate applied is based on historical forfeiture rates. The Company does not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future and therefore uses an expected dividend yield of zero in the option pricing model.  Index to Financial Statements The fair value of each stock option grant was estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model with the following assumptions and fair value per share: ##TABLE_START   Fiscal Year Ended January 31,  Stock Options  2014   2013   2012  Volatility   37 - 43 %   43 - 51 %   47 - 51 % Estimated life   3.4 years    3.7 years    3.7 years  Risk-free interest rate   0.48 - 1.21 %   0.43 - 0.77 %   0.68 - 1.77 % Weighted-average fair value per share of grants  $ 14.08   $ 12.94   $ 12.29    Fiscal Year Ended January 31,  ESPP  2014   2013   2012  Volatility   31 - 35 %   39 - 46 %   50 - 53 % Estimated life   0.75 years    0.75 years    0.75 years  Risk-free interest rate   0.07 - 0.10 %   0.03 - 0.22 %   0.95 - 1.08 % Weighted-average fair value per share of grants  $ 10.30   $ 11.39    8.59  ##TABLE_END The Company estimated its future stock price volatility considering both its observed option-implied volatilities and its historical volatility calculations. Management believes this is the best estimate of the expected volatility over the expected life of its stock options and stock purchase rights. The estimated life for the stock options was based on an analysis of historical exercise activity. The estimated life for the ESPP was based on the two purchase periods within each offering period. The risk-free interest rate is based on the rate for a U.S. government security with the same estimated life at the time of the option grant and the stock purchase rights. Advertising Expenses Advertising is expensed as incurred. Advertising expense was $155.8 million, $110.7 million and $80.3 million for fiscal 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. Income Taxes The Company uses the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on temporary differences between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax laws is recognized in the consolidated statement of operations in the period that includes the enactment date. The Companys tax positions are subject to income tax audits by multiple tax jurisdictions throughout the world. The Company recognizes the tax benefit of an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the position is sustainable upon examination by the taxing authority, solely based on its technical merits. The tax benefit recognized is measured as the largest amount of benefit which is greater than 50 percent likely to be realized upon settlement with the taxing authority. The Company recognizes interest accrued and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in the income tax provision. Valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amounts more likely than not expected to be realized based on the weighting of positive and negative evidence. Future realization of deferred tax assets ultimately depends on the existence of sufficient taxable income of the appropriate character (for example, ordinary income or capital gain) within the carryback or carryforward periods  Index to Financial Statements available under the tax law. The Company regularly reviews the deferred tax assets for recoverability based on historical taxable income, projected future taxable income, the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences and tax planning strategies. The Companys judgments regarding future profitability may change due to many factors, including future market conditions and the ability to successfully execute its business plans and/or tax planning strategies. Should there be a change in the ability to recover deferred tax assets, the tax provision would increase or decrease in the period in which the assessment is changed. Foreign Currency Translation The functional currency of the Companys major foreign subsidiaries is generally the local currency. Adjustments resulting from translating foreign functional currency financial statements into U.S. dollars are recorded as a separate component on the consolidated statements of comprehensive loss. Foreign currency transaction gains and losses are included in net loss for the period. All assets and liabilities denominated in a foreign currency are translated into U.S. dollars at the exchange rate on the balance sheet date. Revenues and expenses are translated at the average exchange rate during the period. Equity transactions are translated using historical exchange rates. Warranties and Indemnification The Companys enterprise cloud computing services are typically warranted to perform in a manner consistent with general industry standards that are reasonably applicable and materially in accordance with the Companys online help documentation under normal use and circumstances. The Companys arrangements generally include certain provisions for indemnifying customers against liabilities if its products or services infringe a third-partys intellectual property rights. To date, the Company has not incurred any material costs as a result of such obligations and has not accrued any liabilities related to such obligations in the accompanying consolidated financial statements. The Company has also agreed to indemnify its directors and executive officers for costs associated with any fees, expenses, judgments, fines and settlement amounts incurred by any of these persons in any action or proceeding to which any of those persons is, or is threatened to be, made a party by reason of the persons service as a director or officer, including any action by the Company, arising out of that persons services as the Companys director or officer or that persons services provided to any other company or enterprise at the Companys request. The Company maintains director and officer insurance coverage that would generally enable the Company to recover a portion of any future amounts paid. The Company may also be subject to indemnification obligations by law with respect to the actions of its employees under certain circumstances and in certain jurisdictions. New Accounting Pronouncements In July 2012, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2012-02, IntangiblesGoodwill and Other (Topic 350)Testing Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets for Impairment (ASU 2012-02), to allow entities to use a qualitative approach to test indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment. ASU 2012-02 permits an entity to first perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of an indefinite-lived intangible asset is less than its carrying value. If it is concluded that this is the case, it is necessary to perform the currently prescribed quantitative impairment test by comparing the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset with its carrying value. Otherwise, the quantitative impairment test is not required. The Company adopted ASU 2012-02 in fiscal 2014. The adoption did not have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements. In July 2013, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2013-11, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Presentation of an Unrecognized Tax Benefit When a Net Operating Loss Carryforward, a Similar Tax Loss, or a  Index to Financial Statements Tax Credit Carryforward Exists (ASU 2013-11), which provides guidance on the financial statement presentation of an unrecognized tax benefit when a net operating loss (NOL) carryforward, a similar tax loss, or a tax credit carryforward exists. ASU 2013-11 supports the approach for companies to present an unrecognized tax benefit as a reduction of a deferred tax asset for a NOL or tax credit carryforward whenever the NOL or tax credit carryforward would be available to reduce the additional taxable income or tax due if the tax position is disallowed. This approach requires companies to assess whether to net the unrecognized tax benefit with a deferred tax asset as of the reporting date. The Company adopted ASU 2013-11 in fiscal 2014 and the adoption did not have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements. 2.

The Company does not believe any of the unrealized losses represent an other-than-temporary impairment based on its evaluation of available evidence as of January 31, 2014. The Company expects to receive the full principal and interest on all of these marketable securities. Fair Value Measurement All of the Companys cash equivalents, marketable securities and foreign currency derivative contracts are classified within Level 1 or Level 2 because the Companys cash equivalents, marketable securities and foreign currency derivative contracts are valued using quoted market prices or alternative pricing sources and models utilizing observable market inputs. During fiscal 2014, the Company transferred certain amounts within the fair value hierarchy. U.S. treasury securities and Foreign government obligations at January 31, 2014 are now reported as Level 2 fair value instruments rather than Level 1 based on market activity. The Company uses a three-tier fair value hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used in the valuation methodologies in measuring fair value: Level 1. Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. Level 2. Other inputs that are directly or indirectly observable in the marketplace. Level 3. Unobservable inputs which are supported by little or no market activity.  Index to Financial Statements The following table presents information about the Companys assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value as of January 31, 2014 and indicates the fair value hierarchy of the valuation (in thousands): ##TABLE_START Description  Quoted Prices in Active Markets for Identical Assets (Level 1)   Significant Other Observable Inputs (Level 2)   Significant Unobservable Inputs (Level 3)   Balances as of January 31, 2014  Cash equivalents (1):     Time deposits  $ 0   $ 212,700   $ 0   $ 212,700  Money market mutual funds   87,898    0    0    87,898  Marketable securities:     Corporate notes and obligations   0    341,850    0    341,850  U.S. treasury securities   0    16,044    0    16,044  Mortgage backed obligations   0    25,076    0    25,076  Asset backed securities   0    38,217    0    38,217  Municipal securities   0    1,998    0    1,998  Foreign government obligations   0    24,474    0    24,474  U.S. agency obligations   0    14,725    0    14,725  Covered bonds   0    76,998    0    76,998  Foreign currency derivative contracts (2)   0    1,598    0    1,598          Total Assets  $ 87,898   $ 753,680   $ 0   $ 841,578  Liabilities     Foreign currency derivative contracts (3)  $ 0   $ 1,801   $ 0   $ 1,801          Total Liabilities  $ 0   $ 1,801   $ 0   $ 1,801          ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START (1) Included in cash and cash equivalents in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet as of January 31, 2014, in addition to $481.0 million of cash. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START (2) Included in prepaid expenses and other current assets in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet as of January 31, 2014. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START (3) Included in accounts payable, accrued expenses and other liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet as of January 31, 2014. ##TABLE_END  Index to Financial Statements The following table presents information about the Companys assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value as of January 31, 2013 and indicates the fair value hierarchy of the valuation (in thousands): ##TABLE_START Description  Quoted Prices in Active Markets for Identical Assets (Level 1)   Significant Other Observable Inputs (Level 2)   Significant Unobservable Inputs (Level 3)   Balances as of January 31, 2013  Cash equivalents (1):     Time deposits  $ 0   $ 22,372   $ 0   $ 22,372  Money market mutual funds   385,700    0    0    385,700  Marketable securities:     Corporate notes and obligations   0    689,889    0    689,889  U.S. treasury securities   38,869    0    0    38,869  Mortgage backed obligations   0    12,723    0    12,723  Municipal securities   0    2,666    0    2,666  Foreign government obligations   9,641    0    0    9,641  Collateralized mortgage obligations   0    151,876    0    151,876  U.S. agency obligations   0    105,376    0    105,376  Foreign currency derivative contracts (2)   0    5,643    0    5,643          Total Assets  $ 434,210   $ 990,545   $ 0   $ 1,424,755          Liabilities     Foreign currency derivative contracts (3)  $ 0   $ 3,307   $ 0   $ 3,307          Total Liabilities  $ 0   $ 3,307   $ 0   $ 3,307          ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START (1) Included in cash and cash equivalents in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet as of January 31, 2013, in addition to $339.2 million of cash. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START (2) Included in prepaid expenses and other current assets in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet as of January 31, 2013. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START (3) Included in accounts payable, accrued expenses and other liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet as of January 31, 2013. ##TABLE_END Derivative Financial Instruments The Company enters into foreign currency derivative contracts with financial institutions to reduce the risk that its cash flows and earnings will be adversely affected by foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. The Company uses forward currency derivative contracts to minimize the Companys exposure to balances primarily denominated in Euros, Japanese yen, Canadian dollars and British pounds. The Companys foreign currency derivative contracts which are not designated as hedging instruments are used to reduce the exchange rate risk associated primarily with intercompany receivables and payables. The Companys program is not designated for trading or speculative purposes. As of January 31, 2014 and 2013, the foreign currency derivative contracts that were not settled are recorded at fair value on the consolidated balance sheets. Foreign currency derivative contracts are marked-to-market at the end of each reporting period with gains and losses recognized as other expense to offset the gains or losses resulting from the settlement or remeasurement of the underlying foreign currency denominated receivables and payables. While the contract or notional amount is often used to express the volume of foreign currency derivative contracts, the amounts potentially subject to credit risk are generally limited to the amounts, if any, by which the counterparties obligations under the agreements exceed the obligations of the Company to the counterparties.  Index to Financial Statements Details on outstanding foreign currency derivative contracts related primarily to intercompany receivables and payables are presented below (in thousands): ##TABLE_START    As of January 31,     2014   2013  Notional amount of foreign currency derivative contracts  $ 563,060   $ 692,637  Fair value of foreign currency derivative contracts  $ (203 )  $ 2,336  ##TABLE_END The fair value of the Companys outstanding derivative instruments are summarized below (in thousands): ##TABLE_START      Fair Value of Derivative Instruments       As of January 31,    Balance Sheet Location   2014   2013  Derivative Assets    Derivatives not designated as hedging instruments:    Foreign currency derivative contracts    Prepaid expenses and other current assets    $ 1,598   $ 5,643       Derivative Liabilities    Derivatives not designated as hedging instruments:    Foreign currency derivative contracts     Accounts payable, accrued expenses and other liabilities     $ 1,801   $ 3,307       ##TABLE_END The effect of the derivative instruments not designated as hedging instruments on the consolidated statements of operations during fiscal 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively, are summarized below (in thousands): ##TABLE_START Derivatives Not Designated as Hedging Instruments  Gains on Derivative Instruments Recognized in Income       Fiscal Year Ended January 31,     Location   2014   2013   2012  Foreign currency derivative contracts   Other expense   $ 108   $ 16,591   $ 6,221         ##TABLE_END Strategic Investments The Company has three investments in marketable equity securities measured using quoted prices in their respective active markets and certain interests in non-marketable equity and debt securities that are collectively considered strategic investments. As of January 31, 2014, the fair value of the Companys marketable equity securities of $15.5 million includes an unrealized gain of $13.3 million. As of January 31, 2013, the Company had four investments in marketable equity securities which had a fair value of $4.9 million which included an unrealized gain of $1.7 million. These investments are recorded in other assets, net on the consolidated balance sheets. The Companys interest in non-marketable equity and debt securities consists of noncontrolling equity and debt investments in privately-held companies. The Companys investments in these privately-held companies are reported at cost or marked down to fair value when an event or circumstance indicates an other-than-temporary decline in value has occurred. These investments are valued using significant unobservable inputs or data in an inactive market and the valuation requires the Companys judgment due to the absence of market price and inherent lack of liquidity.  Index to Financial Statements As of January 31, 2014 and 2013, the carrying value of the Companys investments in privately-held companies was $77.0 million and $46.8 million, respectively. These investments are recorded in other assets, net on the consolidated balance sheets. Investment Income Investment income consists of interest income, realized gains, and realized losses on the Companys cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities. The components of investment income are presented below (in thousands): ##TABLE_START   Fiscal Year Ended January 31,    2014   2013   2012  Interest income  $ 9,512   $ 17,903   $ 20,791  Realized gains   5,952    5,007    6,542  Realized losses   (5,246 )   (3,348 )   (4,065 )       Total investment income  $ 10,218   $ 19,562   $ 23,268        ##TABLE_END Reclassification adjustments out of accumulated other comprehensive loss into net loss were immaterial for fiscal 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. 3. Property and Equipment Property and equipment consisted of the following (in thousands): ##TABLE_START    As of January 31,    2014   2013  Land  $ 248,263   $ 248,263  Building improvements   49,572    49,572  Computers, equipment and software   931,171    328,318  Furniture and fixtures   58,956    38,275  Leasehold improvements   296,390    193,181  Building in progressleased facility   40,171    0        1,624,523    857,609  Less accumulated depreciation and amortization   (383,777 )   (252,940 )      $ 1,240,746   $ 604,669      ##TABLE_END Depreciation and amortization expense totaled $185.9 million, $101.1 million and $69.8 million during fiscal 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. Computers, equipment and software at January 31, 2014 and 2013 included a total of $612.0 million and $136.9 million acquired under capital lease agreements, respectively. Accumulated amortization relating to computers, equipment and software under capital leases totaled $109.1 million and $57.8 million, respectively, at January 31, 2014 and 2013. Amortization of assets under capital leases is included in depreciation and amortization expense. In June 2013, the Company entered into a large capital lease agreement for software for a period of nine years, which consists of the contractual term of six years and a renewal option of three years. The capitalized portion will be depreciated over the estimated useful life of the software, which is nine years. In November 2010, the Company purchased approximately 14 acres of undeveloped real estate in San Francisco, California, including entitlements and improvements associated with the land. In addition to the  Index to Financial Statements amounts reflected in the table above, the Company recorded $23.3 million related to the perpetual parking rights and classified such rights as a purchased intangible asset as it represents an intangible right to use the existing garage. The Company has capitalized pre-construction activities related to the development of the land, including interest costs and property taxes since the November 2010 purchase. During the first quarter of fiscal 2013, the Company suspended pre-construction activity. The total carrying value of the land, building improvements and perpetual parking rights was $321.1 million as of January 31, 2014. The Company continues to evaluate its future needs for office facilities space and its options for the undeveloped real estate, which may include selling a portion of or all the real estate holdings, or suspending pre-construction activity for several more years. In December 2012, the Company entered into a lease agreement for approximately 445,000 rentable square feet of office space in San Francisco, California. The space rented is for the total office space available in the building, which is in the process of being constructed. As a result of the Companys involvement during the construction period, the Company is considered for accounting purposes to be the owner of the construction project. As of January 31, 2014, the Company capitalized $40.2 million of construction costs, based on the construction costs incurred to date by the landlord, and recorded a corresponding noncurrent financing obligation liability of $40.2 million. The total expected financing obligation associated with this lease upon completion of the construction of the building, inclusive of the amounts currently recorded, is $335.8 million (See Note 10 for future commitment details). The obligation will be settled through monthly lease payments to the landlord once the construction is complete and the office space is ready for occupancy. There was no impairment of long-lived assets during fiscal 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. 4. Business Combinations ExactTarget On July 12, 2013, the Company acquired for cash the outstanding stock of ExactTarget, a leading global provider of cross-channel, digital marketing solutions that empower organizations of all sizes to communicate with their customers through the digital channels they use most. The Company acquired ExactTarget to, among other things, create a world-class marketing platform across the channels of email, social, mobile and the web. The Company has included the financial results of ExactTarget in the consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisition. The acquisition date fair value of the consideration transferred for ExactTarget was approximately $2.6 billion, including the proceeds from the term loan of $300.0 million (see Note 5), which consisted of the following (in thousands): ##TABLE_START   Fair value  Cash  $ 2,567,098  Fair value of equity awards assumed   17,428    Total  $ 2,584,526    ##TABLE_END The estimated fair value of the stock options assumed by the Company was determined using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. The share conversion ratio of 0.84 was applied to convert ExactTargets outstanding equity awards for ExactTargets common stock into equity awards for shares of the Companys common stock.  Index to Financial Statements The following table summarizes the estimated fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of the date of acquisition (in thousands): ##TABLE_START   Fair Value  Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities  $ 91,549  Accounts receivable   63,320  Other current assets   20,355  Customer contract asset, current and noncurrent   205,033  Property and equipment   64,782  Other noncurrent assets   4,379  Intangible assets   706,064  Goodwill   1,848,653  Accounts payable, accrued expenses and other liabilities   (65,636 ) Deferred revenue, current and noncurrent   (46,615 ) Customer liability, current and noncurrent   (144,792 ) Other liabilities, noncurrent   (3,104 ) Deferred tax liability   (159,462 )   Net assets acquired  $ 2,584,526    ##TABLE_END The excess of purchase consideration over the fair value of net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired was recorded as goodwill. The fair values assigned to tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed are based on managements estimates and assumptions. The deferred tax liability established was primarily a result of the difference in the book basis and tax basis related to the identifiable intangible assets. The estimated fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed, specifically current and noncurrent income taxes payable and deferred taxes, may be subject to change as additional information is received and certain tax returns are finalized. Thus the provisional measurements of fair value set forth above are subject to change. The Company expects to finalize the valuation as soon as practicable, but not later than one-year from the acquisition date. The following table sets forth the components of identifiable intangible assets acquired and their estimated useful lives as of the date of acquisition (in thousands): ##TABLE_START    Fair Value   Useful Life  Developed technologies  $ 307,200    4 - 7 years  Customer relationships   362,200    6 - 8 years  Trade name and trademark   29,400    10 years  Other purchased intangible assets   7,264    3 - 4 years     Total intangible assets subject to amortization  $ 706,064      ##TABLE_END Developed technologies represent the estimated fair value of ExactTargets digital marketing technology. Customer relationships represent the estimated fair values of the underlying relationships with ExactTarget customers. The goodwill balance is primarily attributed to the assembled workforce and expanded market opportunities when integrating ExactTargets digital marketing technology with the Companys other offerings. The goodwill balance is not deductible for U.S. income tax purposes. The Company assumed unvested options and restricted stock with an estimated fair value of $102.2 million. Of the total consideration, $17.4 million was allocated to the purchase consideration and $84.8 million was allocated to future services and will be expensed over the remaining service periods on a straight-line basis.  Index to Financial Statements The amounts of revenue and earnings of ExactTarget included in the Companys consolidated statement of operations from the acquisition date of July 12, 2013 to the period ending January 31, 2014 are as follows (in thousands): ##TABLE_START Total revenues  $ 194,008  Loss  $ (152,948 ) ##TABLE_END The following pro forma financial information summarizes the combined results of operations for the Company and ExactTarget, which was significant for purposes of the unaudited pro forma financial information disclosure, as though the companies were combined as of the beginning of the Companys fiscal 2013. The unaudited pro forma financial information was as follows (in thousands): ##TABLE_START   Fiscal Year Ended January 31,    2014   2013  Total revenues  $ 4,267,166   $ 3,279,421  Loss  $ (364,659 )  $ (346,636 ) ##TABLE_END The pro forma financial information for all periods presented has been calculated after adjusting the results of ExactTarget to reflect the business combination accounting effects resulting from this acquisition including the amortization expense from acquired intangible assets and the stock-based compensation expense for unvested stock options and restricted stock awards assumed as though the acquisition occurred as of the beginning of the Companys fiscal year 2013.

Interest is payable semi-annually in arrears on January 15 and July 15 of each year. In March 2013, the Company issued at par value $1.15 billion of 0.25% convertible senior notes (the 0.25% Senior Notes, and together with the 0.75% Senior Notes, the Notes) due April 1, 2018, unless earlier purchased by the Company or converted. Interest is payable semi-annually, in arrears on April 1 and October 1 of each year commencing October 1, 2013. The Notes are governed by indentures between the Company, as issuer, and U.S. Bank National Association, as trustee. The Notes are unsecured and do not contain any financial covenants or any restrictions on the payment of dividends, the incurrence of senior debt or other indebtedness, or the issuance or repurchase of securities by the Company.

Holders of the Notes will not receive any cash payment representing accrued and unpaid interest upon conversion of a Note. Accrued but unpaid interest will be deemed to be paid in full upon conversion rather than cancelled, extinguished or forfeited. Holders may convert their Notes under the following circumstances: ##TABLE_START    during any fiscal quarter, if, for at least 20 trading days during the 30 consecutive trading day period ending on the last trading day of the immediately preceding fiscal quarter, the last reported sales price of the Companys common stock for such trading day is greater than or equal to 130% of the applicable conversion price on such trading day share of common stock on such last trading day; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    in certain situations, when the trading price of the Notes is less than 98% of the product of the sale price of the Companys common stock and the conversion rate; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    upon the occurrence of specified corporate transactions described under the Notes Indenture, such as a consolidation, merger or binding share exchange; or ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    at any time on or after the convertible dates noted above. ##TABLE_END Holders of the Notes have the right to require the Company to purchase with cash all or a portion of the Notes upon the occurrence of a fundamental change, such as a change of control, at a purchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Notes plus accrued and unpaid interest. Following certain corporate transactions that constitute a change of control, the Company will increase the conversion rate for a holder who elects to convert the Notes in connection with such change of control. In accounting for the issuance of the Notes, the Company separated the Notes into liability and equity components. The carrying amount of the liability component was calculated by measuring the fair value of a similar liability that does not have an associated convertible feature. The carrying amount of the equity component representing the conversion option was determined by deducting the fair value of the liability component from the par value of the Notes as a whole. The excess of the principal amount of the liability component over its carrying amount (debt discount) is amortized to interest expense over the term of the Notes. The equity component is not remeasured as long as it continues to meet the conditions for equity classification. In accounting for the transaction costs related to the Note issuance, the Company allocated the total amount incurred to the liability and equity components based on their relative values. Transaction costs attributable to the liability component are being amortized to expense over the term of the Notes, and transaction costs attributable to the equity component were netted with the equity component in temporary stockholders equity and stockholders equity. Additionally, the Company recorded a deferred tax liability of $51.1 million in connection with the 0.75% Senior Notes.  Index to Financial Statements The Notes consisted of the following (in thousands): ##TABLE_START   As of January 31,    2014   2013  Liability component :   Principal:   0.75% Senior Notes (1)  $ 568,864   $ 574,890  0.25% Senior Notes (1)   1,150,000    0  Less: debt discount, net   0.75% Senior Notes (2)   (26,705 )   (53,612 ) 0.25% Senior Notes (3)   (103,070 )   0      Net carrying amount  $ 1,589,089   $ 521,278      ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START (1) The effective interest rates of the 0.75% Senior Notes and 0.25% Senior Notes are 5.86% and 2.53%, respectively. These interest rates were based on the interest rates of a similar liability at the time of issuance that did not have an associated convertible feature. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START (2) Included in the consolidated balance sheets within Convertible 0.75% Senior Notes (which is classified as a current liability, as these notes were convertible) and is amortized over the life of the 0.75% Senior Notes using the effective interest rate method. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START (3) Included in the consolidated balance sheets within Convertible 0.25% Senior Notes (which is classified as a noncurrent liability) and is amortized over the life of the 0.25% Senior Notes using the effective interest rate method. ##TABLE_END The total estimated fair values of the Companys 0.75% Senior Notes and 0.25% Senior Notes at January 31, 2014 were $1.6 billion and $1.3 billion, respectively. The fair value was determined based on the closing trading price per $100 of the 0.75% Senior Notes and 0.25% Senior Notes as of the last day of trading for fiscal 2014. Based on the closing price of the Companys common stock of $60.53 on January 31, 2014, the if-converted value of the 0.75% Senior Notes exceeded their principal amount by approximately $1.0 billion and the if-converted value of the 0.25% Senior Notes was less than their principal amount. Through the filing of this Form 10-K, the Company has received conversion notices on our 0.75% Senior Notes for approximately $280.0 million in aggregate principal balance that the Company will settle in fiscal 2015. Note Hedges To minimize the impact of potential economic dilution upon conversion of the Notes, the Company entered into convertible note hedge transactions with respect to its common stock (the Note Hedges). ##TABLE_START (in thousands, except for shares)  Date   Purchase   Shares  0.75% Note Hedges   January 2010   $ 126,500    26,943,812  0.25% Note Hedges   March 2013   $ 153,800    17,308,880  ##TABLE_END The Note Hedges cover shares of the Companys common stock at a strike price that corresponds to the initial conversion price of the respective Notes, also subject to adjustment, and are exercisable upon conversion of the Notes. The Note Hedges will expire upon the maturity of the Notes. The Note Hedges are intended to reduce the potential economic dilution upon conversion of the Notes in the event that the market value per share of the Companys common stock, as measured under the Notes, at the time of exercise is greater than the conversion price of the Notes. The Note Hedges are separate transactions and are not part of the terms of the Notes. Holders of the Notes will not have any rights with respect to the Note Hedges. The Company initially recorded a deferred tax asset of $51.4 million in connection with the 0.75% Note Hedges. The Note Hedges do not impact earnings per share.

As the average market value per share of the Companys common stock for the reporting period, as measured under the 0.75% Warrants, exceeds the strike price of the 0.75% Warrants, the 0.75% Warrants would have a dilutive effect on the Companys earnings/loss per share if the Company were to report net income for fiscal 2014. The Warrants were anti-dilutive for the periods presented. The Warrants are separate transactions, entered into by the Company and are not part of the terms of the Notes or Note Hedges. Holders of the Notes and Note Hedges will not have any rights with respect to the Warrants. Term Loan On July 11, 2013, the Company entered into a credit agreement (the Credit Agreement) with Bank of America, N.A. and certain other lenders.

The Company entered into the Term Loan in conjunction with and for purposes of funding the acquisition of ExactTarget. Interest is due and payable in arrears quarterly for the loan bearing interest at the base rate and at the end of an interest period in the case of the loan bearing interest at the adjusted LIBOR rate. The Term Loan is payable in quarterly installments equal to $7.5 million beginning on September 30, 2013, with the remaining outstanding principal amount of the term loan being due and payable on the Maturity Date. The Company may prepay the Term Loan, in whole or in part at any time during the term of the Term Loan. Amounts repaid or prepaid may not be reborrowed under the terms of the Credit Agreement. The Term Loan is secured by a pledge of 100 percent of the equity securities of the Companys direct domestic subsidiaries and 65 percent of the equity securities of the Companys foreign subsidiaries. The Credit Agreement contains certain customary affirmative and negative covenants, including a consolidated leverage ratio covenant, a consolidated interest coverage ratio covenant, a limit on the Companys ability to incur additional indebtedness, issue preferred stock or pay dividends, and certain other restrictions on the Companys activities each defined specifically in the Credit Agreement. The Company was in compliance with the Credit Agreements covenants as of January 31, 2014. The weighted average interest rate on the Term Loan was 2.0% for fiscal 2014. As of January 31, 2014, the current portion outstanding under the Term Loan was $30.0 million and the noncurrent outstanding portion was $255.0 million.

Stockholders Equity The Company maintains the following stock plans: the 2006 Inducement Equity Incentive Plan (the Inducement Plan), 2004 Employee Stock Purchase Plan and the 2013 Equity Incentive Plan. The expiration of the 1999 Stock Option Plan (1999 Plan) in fiscal 2010 did not affect awards outstanding, which continue to be governed by the terms and conditions of the 1999 Plan. On February 1, 2013, 14.0 million additional shares were reserved under the 2004 Equity Incentive Plan and 4.0 million additional shares were reserved under the ESPP pursuant to the automatic increase in each respective plan. On June 6, 2013, the Companys stockholders approved the 2013 Equity Incentive Plan (the 2013 Plan) with a reserve of 48.0 million shares of common stock for future issuance. In addition, 21.9 million shares of common stock that were previously available for grant under the 2004 Equity Incentive Plan and the 2004 Outside Directors Stock Plan (collectively, the Prior Plans) as of June 6, 2013, expired and were added to the 2013 Plan share reserve. Any shares of common stock subject to outstanding awards under the Prior Plans that expire, are forfeited, or repurchased by the Company also will be available for future grant under the 2013 Plan. In September 2011, the Companys Board of Directors amended and restated the ESPP. In conjunction with the amendment of the ESPP, the Companys Board of Directors determined that the offerings under the ESPP would commence, beginning with a twelve month offering period starting in December 2011. As of January 31, 2014, $23.9 million has been withheld on behalf of employees for future purchases under the plan and is recorded in accrued expenses and other liabilities. Employees purchased 2.9 million shares for $92.5 million and 3.0 million shares for $69.1 million, in fiscal 2014 and 2013, respectively, under the ESPP. Prior to February 1, 2006, options issued under the Companys stock option plans generally had a term of 10 years. From February 1, 2006 through July 3, 2013, options issued had a term of 5 years. After July 3, 2013, options issued have a term of 7 years.

The expense related to these awards, which was expensed immediately at the time of the issuance, totaled $4.5 million, $3.8 million and $4.9 million for fiscal 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. Preferred Stock The Companys board of directors has the authority, without further action by stockholders, to issue up to 5,000,000 shares of preferred stock in one or more series. The Companys board of directors may designate the rights, preferences, privileges and restrictions of the preferred stock, including dividend rights, conversion rights,  Index to Financial Statements voting rights, terms of redemption, liquidation preference, sinking fund terms, and number of shares constituting any series or the designation of any series. The issuance of preferred stock could have the effect of restricting dividends on the Companys common stock, diluting the voting power of its common stock, impairing the liquidation rights of its common stock, or delaying or preventing a change in control. The ability to issue preferred stock could delay or impede a change in control. As of January 31, 2014 and 2013, no shares of preferred stock were outstanding. 8.

During fiscal 2014, the Company recorded a partial release of its valuation allowance primarily in connection with the acquisition of ExactTarget. Due to the ExactTarget acquisition, a deferred tax liability was recorded for the book-tax basis difference related to purchased intangibles. The net deferred tax liability from acquisitions provided an additional source of income to support the realizability of the Companys pre-existing deferred tax assets and as a result, the Company released a portion of its valuation allowance and recorded a tax benefit of $143.1 million for fiscal 2014. During fiscal 2014, 2013 and 2012, the Company recorded net tax benefits that resulted from allocating certain tax effects related to exercises of stock options and vesting of restricted stocks directly to stockholders equity in the amount of $8.0 million, $7.2 million and $1.6 million, respectively.

These temporary tax reduction programs will both expire in fiscal 2016. Deferred Income Taxes Deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effect of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes. Significant components of the Companys deferred tax assets and liabilities were as follows (in thousands): ##TABLE_START   As of January 31,    2014   2013  Deferred tax assets:   Net operating loss carryforwards  $ 259,465   $ 62,603  Deferred stock compensation   82,840    69,593  Tax credits   107,381    75,812  Deferred rent expense   47,063    28,022  Accrued liabilities   79,235    63,257  Deferred revenue   8,522    30,441  Basis difference on investment   11,999    8,569  Financing obligation   63,673    0  Other   17,762    9,916      Total deferred tax assets   677,940    348,213  Less valuation allowance   (180,223 )   (192,682 )     Deferred tax assets, net of valuation allowance   497,717    155,531  Deferred tax liabilities:   Deferred commissions   (87,625 )   (72,470 ) Purchased intangibles   (259,409 )   (14,739 ) Unrealized gains on investments   (5,232 )   (2,768 ) Depreciation and amortization   (144,752 )   (41,832 ) Other   (3,599 )   (7,351 )     Total deferred tax liabilities   (500,617 )   (139,160 )     Net deferred tax assets  $ (2,900 )  $ 16,371      ##TABLE_END At January 31, 2014, the Company had net operating loss carryforwards for federal income tax purposes of approximately $1.8 billion, which expire in fiscal 2021 through fiscal 2034, federal research and development tax credits of approximately $72.8 million, which expire in fiscal 2020 through fiscal 2034, foreign tax credits of approximately $15.4 million, which expires in fiscal 2019 through fiscal 2024, and minimum tax credits of $0.7 million, which have no expiration date. The Company also had net operating loss carryforwards for California of  Index to Financial Statements approximately $794.6 million which expire beginning in fiscal 2015 through fiscal 2034 and state research and development tax credits of approximately $68.1 million, which do not expire, and $9.5 million of state enterprise zone tax credits, which expires in fiscal 2024. Company also had other states net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $600.0 million which expire beginning in fiscal 2015 through fiscal 2034. Utilization of the Companys net operating loss carryforwards may be subject to substantial annual limitation due to the ownership change limitations provided by the Internal Revenue Code and similar state provisions. Such an annual limitation could result in the expiration of the net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards before utilization. The Company regularly assesses the need for a valuation allowance against its deferred tax assets by considering both positive and negative evidence related to the likelihood of the realization of its deferred taxes to determine if it is more-likely-than-not that some or all of its deferred tax assets will be realized. In evaluating the need for a valuation allowance, the Company considers its cumulative loss in recent years as a significant piece of negative evidence. During fiscal 2014, the valuation allowance decreased by $12.5 million. The net reduction was primarily due to the partial release of the valuation allowance in connection with the acquisition of ExactTarget offset with the increase in the valuation allowance due to current year operating losses. The Company will continue to assess the realizability of the deferred tax assets in each of the applicable jurisdictions going forward and adjust the valuation allowance accordingly. The excess tax benefits associated with stock option exercises are recorded directly to stockholders equity only when the tax deduction is realized on the income tax returns. As a result, the excess tax benefits included in net operating loss carryforwards but are not reflected in deferred tax assets for fiscal 2014 and 2013 are $408.8 million and $316.2 million, respectively. Tax Benefits Related to Stock-Based Compensation The total income tax benefit related to stock-based awards was $147.8 million $113.9 million and $76.0 million for fiscal 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively, the majority of which was not recognized as a result of the valuation allowance since fiscal 2013. Unrecognized Tax Benefits and Other Considerations Tax positions for the Company and its subsidiaries are subject to income tax audits by many tax jurisdictions throughout the world. The Company recognizes the tax benefit of an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the position is sustainable upon examination by the taxing authority, based on the technical merits. The tax benefit recognized is measured as the largest amount of benefit which is greater than 50 percent likely to be realized upon settlement with the taxing authority. The Company had gross unrecognized tax benefits of $102.3 million, $75.1 million and $52.0 million as of January 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012 respectively. A reconciliation of the beginning and ending balance of total unrecognized tax benefits for fiscal years 2014, 2013, and 2012 is as follows (in thousands): ##TABLE_START   Fiscal Year Ended January 31,    2014   2013   2012  Balance as of February 1,  $ 75,144   $ 51,971   $ 27,462  Tax positions taken in prior period:    Gross increases   8,420    7,304    10,008  Gross decreases   (4,466 )   (4,460 )   (23 ) Tax positions taken in current period:    Gross increases   27,952    24,401    15,965  Settlements   0    (121 )   0  Lapse of statute of limitations   (5,205 )   (4,159 )   (1,143 ) Currency translation effect   430    208    (298 )       Balance as of January 31,  $ 102,275   $ 75,144   $ 51,971        ##TABLE_END  Index to Financial Statements For fiscal 2014, 2013 and 2012 total unrecognized tax benefits in an amount of $34.9 million, $32.3 million, and $39.1 million respectively, if recognized, would reduce income tax expense and the Companys effective tax rate after considering the impact of the change in valuation allowance in the U.S. since fiscal 2013. The Company recognizes accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in the income tax provision. The Company accrued penalties and interest in the amount of $0.6 million, $0.3 million and $0.6 million in income tax expense during fiscal 2014, 2013 and 2012. The balance in the non-current income tax payable related to penalties and interest was $3.3 million, $1.7 million and $1.4 million as of January 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012 respectively. The Company has operations and taxable presence in multiple jurisdictions in the U.S. and outside of the U.S. Tax positions for the Company and its subsidiaries are subject to income tax audits by multiple tax jurisdictions around the world. The Company currently considers U.S. federal and state, Canada, Japan, Germany, France and the United Kingdom to be major tax jurisdictions. The Companys U.S. federal and state tax returns since February 1999, which was the inception of the Company, remain open to examination. With some exceptions, tax years prior to fiscal 2008 in jurisdictions outside of U.S. are generally closed. However, in Japan and United Kingdom, the Company is no longer subject to examinations for years prior to fiscal 2009 and fiscal 2011, respectively. In fiscal 2014, the U.S. Internal Revenue Service and California Franchise Tax Board began its examinations for the Companys tax returns for the periods covering fiscal 2011 to 2012 and fiscal 2009 to 2010 respectively. The Company also has examinations in other international jurisdictions, including Canada, Japan, Germany and the United Kingdom. The Company regularly evaluates its uncertain tax positions and the likelihood of outcomes from these tax examinations. Significant judgment and estimates are necessary in the determination of income tax reserves. Although it is often difficult to predict the outcomes of tax examinations, the Company believes that it has provided adequate reserves for its income tax uncertainties. In the next twelve months, the Company does not expect the unrecognized tax benefits balance to materially change due to the uncertainty with these on-going examinations. 9. Earnings/Loss Per Share Basic earnings/loss per share is computed by dividing net income (loss) by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding for the fiscal period. Diluted earnings/loss per share is computed giving effect to all potential weighted average dilutive common stock, including options, restricted stock units, warrants and the convertible senior notes. The dilutive effect of outstanding awards and convertible securities is reflected in diluted earnings per share by application of the treasury stock method. Diluted loss per share for fiscal 2014, 2013 and 2012 are the same as basic loss per share as there is a net loss in these periods and inclusion of potentially issuable shares would be anti-dilutive. A reconciliation of the denominator used in the calculation of basic and diluted loss per share is as follows (in thousands): ##TABLE_START   Fiscal Year Ended January 31,    2014   2013   2012  Numerator:    Net loss  $ (232,175 )  $ (270,445 )  $ (11,572 )       Denominator:    Weighted-average shares outstanding for basic loss per share   597,613    564,896    541,208  Effect of dilutive securities:    Convertible senior notes   0    0    0  Employee stock awards   0    0    0  Warrants   0    0    0        Adjusted weighted-average shares outstanding and assumed conversions for diluted loss per share   597,613    564,896    541,208        ##TABLE_END  Index to Financial Statements The weighted-average number of shares outstanding used in the computation of basic and diluted earnings/loss per share does not include the effect of the following potential outstanding common stock. The effects of these potentially outstanding shares were not included in the calculation of diluted earnings/loss per share because the effect would have been anti-dilutive (in thousands): ##TABLE_START   Fiscal Year Ended January 31,    2014   2013   2012  Stock awards   19,664    30,068    30,240  Convertible senior notes   43,965    26,940    26,940  Warrants   44,253    26,944    26,944  ##TABLE_END 10. Commitments Letters of Credit As of January 31, 2014, the Company had a total of $55.4 million in letters of credit outstanding substantially in favor of certain landlords for office space. These letters of credit renew annually and expire at various dates through December 2030. Leases The Company leases facilities space and certain fixed assets under non-cancelable operating and capital leases with various expiration dates. As of January 31, 2014, the future minimum lease payments under non-cancelable operating and capital leases are as follows (in thousands): ##TABLE_START   Capital Leases   Operating Leases   Financing Obligation, Building in ProgressLeased Facility(1)  Fiscal Period:    Fiscal 2015  $ 77,455   $ 196,514   $ 0  Fiscal 2016   72,193    189,757    1,777  Fiscal 2017   73,845    160,521    16,877  Fiscal 2018   83,369    129,733    21,107  Fiscal 2019   99,643    119,027    21,551  Thereafter   200,000    587,528    274,512        Total minimum lease payments   606,505   $ 1,383,080   $ 335,824       Less: amount representing interest   (88,260 )       Present value of capital lease obligations  $ 518,245        ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START (1) Total Financing Obligation, Building in ProgressLeased Facility noted above represents the total obligation on the lease agreement noted in Footnote 3, Property and Equipment, and includes $40.2 million that was recorded to Financing obligation, building in progressleased facility, which is included in Other noncurrent liabilities on the balance sheet. ##TABLE_END The Companys agreements for the facilities and certain services provide the Company with the option to renew. The Companys future contractual obligations would change if the Company exercised these options. The terms of the lease agreements provide for rental payments on a graduated basis. The Company recognizes rent expense on a straight-line basis over the lease period and has accrued for rent expense incurred  Index to Financial Statements but not paid. Of the total operating lease commitment balance of $1.4 billion, approximately $1.3 billion is related to facilities space. The remaining commitment amount is related to computer equipment, other leases, data center capacity and our development and test data center. Rent expense for fiscal 2014, 2013 and 2012 was $123.6 million, $88.3 million and $70.3 million, respectively. 11. Employee Benefit Plan The Company has a 401(k) plan covering all eligible employees in the United States. Since January 1, 2006, the Company has been contributing to the plan. Total Company contributions during fiscal 2014, 2013 and 2012, were $27.9 million, $22.1 million and $15.7 million, respectively. 12. Legal Proceedings and Claims In the ordinary course of business, the Company is involved in various legal proceedings and claims related to alleged infringement of third-party patents and other intellectual property rights, commercial, corporate and securities, labor and employment, wage and hour, and other claims. The Company has been, and may in the future be, put on notice and/or sued by third parties for alleged infringement of their proprietary rights, including patent infringement. In general, the resolution of a legal matter could prevent the Company from offering its service to others, could be material to the Companys financial condition or cash flows, or both, or could otherwise adversely affect the Companys operating results. The Company makes a provision for a liability relating to legal matters when it is both probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. These provisions are reviewed at least quarterly and adjusted to reflect the impacts of negotiations, estimated settlements, legal rulings, advice of legal counsel and other information and events pertaining to a particular matter. In managements opinion, resolution of all current matters is not expected to have a material adverse impact on the Companys consolidated results of operations, cash flows or financial position. However, depending on the nature and timing of any such dispute, an unfavorable resolution of a matter could materially affect the Companys future results of operations or cash flows, or both, of a particular quarter. 13. Related-Party Transactions In January 1999, the salesforce.com/foundation, also referred to as the Foundation, a non-profit public charity, was chartered to build philanthropic programs that are focused on youth and technology. The Companys chairman is the chairman of the Foundation. The Companys chairman, two of the Companys employees and one of the Companys board members hold four of the Foundations ten board seats. The Company does not control the Foundations activities, and accordingly, the Company does not consolidate the Foundations statement of activities with its financial results. Since the Foundations inception, the Company has provided at no charge certain resources to Foundation employees such as office space. The value of these items was approximately $997,000 for fiscal 2014. Additionally, the Company has donated subscriptions to the Companys service to other qualified non-profit organizations. The Company also allows an affiliate of the Foundation to resell the Companys service to non-profit organizations. The Company does not charge the affiliate for these subscriptions, so any revenue from subscriptions provided to non-profit organizations is retained by the Foundation to fund its charitable work. The value of the subscriptions was approximately $15.1 million for fiscal 2014. The Company plans to continue these programs.  Index to Financial Statements 14.

CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES ##TABLE_END (a) Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act), as of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K. In designing and evaluating our disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any disclosure controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. In addition, the design of disclosure controls and procedures must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and that management is required to apply its judgment in evaluating the benefits of possible controls and procedures relative to their costs. Based on managements evaluation, our chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are designed to, and are effective to, provide assurance at a reasonable level that the information we are required to disclose in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in Securities and Exchange Commission rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. (b) Managements Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f). Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of January 31, 2014 based on the 1992 framework established in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework (1992 framework) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). Our internal control over financial reporting includes policies and procedures that provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external reporting purposes in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. In accordance with guidance issued by the Securities and Exchange Commission, companies are permitted to exclude acquisitions from their final assessment of internal control over financial reporting for the first fiscal year in which the acquisition occurred. Our managements evaluation of internal control over financial reporting excluded the internal control activities of ExactTarget, Inc. (ExactTarget), which we acquired July 12, 2013, as discussed in Note 4, Business Combinations, of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. We have included the financial results of ExactTarget in the consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisition. Total revenues subject to ExactTargets internal control over financial reporting represented less than five percent of our consolidated total revenues for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2014. Total assets and net assets subject to ExactTargets internal control over financial reporting represented less than four percent and less than six percent, respectively, of our consolidated total assets and consolidated net assets, excluding acquisition method fair value adjustments, as of January 31, 2014.  Index to Financial Statements Based on the results of our evaluation, our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of January 31, 2014. We reviewed the results of managements assessment with our Audit Committee. The effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of January 31, 2014 has been audited by Ernst  Young LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in its report which is included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. (c) Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting There was no change in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended January 31, 2014 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. (d) Inherent Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls Our management, including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, do not expect that our disclosure controls or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the Company have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty, and that breakdowns can occur because of a simple error or mistake. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people or by management override of the controls. The design of any system of controls also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions; over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or the degree of compliance with policies or procedures may deteriorate. Because of the inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected. ##TABLE_START ", "9B": " ITEM 9B.

BUSINESS Overview Salesforce is a leading provider of enterprise cloud computing solutions, with a focus on customer relationship management, or CRM. We introduced our first CRM solution in February 2000, and we have since expanded that offering with new editions, solutions, enhanced features, platform capabilities and a new analytics solution through internal development and acquisitions. Our mission is to help our customers transform themselves into customer companies by empowering them to connect with their customers in entirely new ways. With our six core cloud service offerings, including sales force automation, customer service and support, marketing automation, community management, analytics and a cloud platform for building custom applications, we provide a next generation customer success platform. Our service offerings are intuitive and easy-to-use, can be deployed rapidly, customized easily and integrated with other platforms and enterprise applications, or apps. We deliver our solutions as a service via all the major Internet browsers and on leading mobile devices. We sell to businesses of all sizes and in almost every industry worldwide on a subscription basis, primarily through our direct sales efforts and also indirectly through partners. Through our platform and other developer tools, we also encourage third parties to develop additional functionality and new apps that run on our platform, which are sold separately from, or in conjunction with, our service. We were incorporated in Delaware in February 1999. Our principal executive offices are located in San Francisco, California and our principal website address is www.salesforce.com. Our office address is The Landmark @ One Market, Suite 300, San Francisco, California 94105. The Cloud, Social, Mobile and Data Science Revolutions We believe that the convergence of cloud, social, mobile and data science technologies is fundamentally transforming how companies sell, service, market, engage and innovate. Cloud computing has changed the way enterprise business apps are developed and deployed. Organizations no longer need to buy and maintain their own infrastructure of servers, storage and development tools in order to create and run business apps. Instead, companies can gain access to a variety of business apps via an Internet browser or mobile device on an as-needed basis, without the cost and complexity of managing the hardware or software in-house. The broad shift to social networking has transformed the way people engage and collaborate and is accelerating the adoption of technologies that connect people and products through feeds and notifications. In addition, the proliferation of mobile phones worldwide continues, and enterprise mobile apps are making it possible for people to conduct business from their phones. As more people and devices become connected, companies are looking for new ways to harness the multitude of data from these connections for new insights to drive business success. Progress in data science and machine learning will move companies beyond just automating business processes to more data-driven, predictive computing. We believe Salesforce is at the forefront of delivering more than a system of record and a system of engagement, but also a system of intelligence for companies of every size and industry to connect with their customers in entirely new ways. Our Six Cloud Service Offerings We provide enterprise cloud computing solutions that include apps and platform services, as well as professional services to facilitate the adoption of our solutions. We offer six core service offerings, all integrated on a single platform, that empower companies to grow sales faster, deliver customer service on multiple devices, market through one-to-one customer journeys, build branded communities for customers, partners and employees, deliver analytics for every business user and develop mobile apps quickly and easily. Our core service offerings are as follows: Sales Cloud. The Sales Cloud is a platform for sales force automation that enables companies to store data, access accurate customer and prospect information, track leads and progress, forecast opportunities and collaborate around any sale on desktop and mobile devices. Our customers use the Sales Cloud to grow their sales pipelines, close more deals, improve sales productivity and gain valuable business insights. The Sales Cloud also offers solutions for partner relationship management (including channel management and partner communities) and complete, accurate customer and contact information. Service Cloud. The Service Cloud is a platform for customer service, enabling companies to effectively address their customer service and support needs. Our customers use the Service Cloud to connect their customer service agents with customers on a multitude of devices and across multiple channelsphone, email, chat, self-service web portals, social networks, online communities and directly within their own products and apps. Marketing Cloud. The Marketing Cloud is a platform for digital marketing that enables companies to plan, personalize and optimize one-to-one customer interactions. Our customers use the Marketing Cloud to map customer journeys to digital marketing interactions across email, mobile, social, web and connected products. With the Marketing Cloud, customer data can also be routed into the Sales Cloud and Service Cloud in the form of leads, contacts and customer service cases to give companies a complete view of their customers. Community Cloud. The Community Cloud, which we announced as a core service offering in October 2014, is a platform for creating trusted, branded destinations for customers, partners and employees to collaborate. It enables companies to engage directly with a specific group of people by giving them access to relevant information, apps and experts. Analytics Cloud. The Analytics Cloud, which we announced as a core service offering in October 2014, is an app and platform for business intelligence. It enables companies to quickly deploy sales, service, marketing and custom analytics apps using any data source. Our customers use the Analytics Cloud to enable any employee to quickly and easily explore business data, uncover new insights, make smarter decisions and take action from anywhere on their mobile device. Salesforce1 Platform. The Salesforce1 Platform is a cloud platform for developing apps. The Salesforce1 Platform is delivered as a service, enabling anyone to build business apps without the burden of managing hardware and software. Our customers, developers and independent software vendors (ISVs) use the Salesforce1 Platform to build apps that manage a variety of business processes and can be accessed anytime and on any mobile device. In addition, the Salesforce1 Platform gives customers the ability to create multiple copies of their company's Salesforce instance in separate environments for a variety of purposes, such as testing and training. Professional Services We offer consulting, deployment, training, implementation and integration services to our customers to facilitate the adoption of our cloud solutions. Our professional service engagements can be billed on a time and materials basis, for a fixed fee or through annual contracts. We offer a number of traditional classroom and online educational classes that address topics such as deploying, using, administering and developing on our service. We offer classes for our partners who deploy our service on behalf of our customers. We bill the traditional classroom and some of the online educational classes on a per person, per class basis. In addition, there is a selection of online educational classes available at no charge to customers that subscribe to our customer service plans. Business Benefits of Using Our Solution The key advantages of our solution include: Secure, private, scalable and reliable. Our service has been designed to provide our customers with privacy and high levels of performance, reliability and security. We have built, and continue to invest in, a comprehensive security infrastructure, including firewalls, intrusion detection systems, and encryption for transmissions over the Internet, which we monitor and test on a regular basis. We built and maintain a multi-tenant application architecture that has been designed to enable our service to scale securely, reliably and cost effectively. Our multi-tenant application architecture maintains the integrity and separation of customer data while still permitting all customers to use the same application functionality simultaneously. Rapid deployment. Our service can be deployed rapidly since our customers do not have to spend time procuring, installing or maintaining the servers, storage, networking equipment, security products or other hardware and software. Ease of integration and configuration. IT professionals are able to integrate and configure our solutions with existing applications quickly and seamlessly. We provide a set of application programming interfaces (APIs) that enable customers and independent software developers to both integrate our solution with existing third-party, custom and legacy apps and write their own application services that integrate with our solutions. For example, many of our customers use our Salesforce1 Platform API to move customer-related data from custom-developed and packaged applications into our service on a periodic basis to provide greater visibility into their activities. High levels of user adoption. We have designed our solutions to be intuitive and easy to use. Our solutions contain many tools and features recognizable to users of popular consumer web services, so users are more familiar with our user interface than typical enterprise applications. As a result, our users can often use and gain benefit from our solutions with minimal training. We have also designed our solutions to be used on mobile devices, making it possible for people to conduct business from their phones. Rapid development of apps using the Salesforce1 Platform. Our customers and third-party developers can create apps rapidly because of the ease of use and the benefits of a multi-tenant platform. We provide the capability for business users to easily customize our applications to suit their specific needs, and also support a variety of programming language support so developers can code complex apps spanning multiple business processes and deliver them via multiple mobile devices. Increased innovation. By providing infrastructure and development environments on demand, we provide developers the opportunity to create new and innovative apps without having to invest in hardware and distribution. Developers with ideas for a new app can create, test and support their solutions on the Salesforce1 Platform and make the app accessible for a subscription fee to customers. Lower total cost of ownership. We enable customers to achieve significant up-front savings relative to the traditional enterprise software model. Customers benefit from the predictability of their future costs since they generally pay for the service on a per subscriber basis for the term of the subscription contract. Because we deploy all upgrades on our servers, new features and functionality automatically become part of our service on the upgrade release date and therefore benefit all of our customers immediately. Our Strategy Our objective is to deliver solutions that help companies transform the way they sell, service, market, engage and innovate. Not only do we provide enterprise cloud apps, we also provide an enterprise cloud computing platform upon which our customers and partners can build and customize apps. Key elements of our strategy include: Strengthening our solutions. We offer multiple editions of our solutions at different price points to meet the needs of customers of different sizes and we have designed our solutions to easily accommodate new features and functionality. We intend to continue to extend all editions of our core solutions with new features and functions and increased security through our own development, acquisitions and partnerships. Expanding into new and high-growth categories. As part of our growth strategy, we are delivering innovative solutions in new and high-growth categories, including marketing, communities, business intelligence and cloud platforms. Extending strategic relationships with existing customers. We see a significant opportunity to deepen our relationships with our existing customers. As our customers realize the benefits of our service, we aim to upgrade the customer to premium editions, extend the duration of the customers' contracts and sell more subscriptions by targeting additional functional areas and business units within the customer organization, and ultimately pursue enterprise-wide deployments. Pursuing new customers. We believe that our offerings provide significant value for businesses of any size. As a result, we will continue to aggressively target businesses of all sizes in top industries and major regions, primarily through our direct sales force. We have steadily increased and plan to continue to increase the number of direct sales professionals we employ, and we intend to develop additional distribution channels for our service. Reducing attrition. Our goal is to have all of our customers renew their subscriptions at the end of their contractual terms. We run customer success and other related programs in an effort to secure renewals of existing customers. Building our business in top software markets globally. We believe that there is a substantial market opportunity for our solutions globally. We plan to continue to aggressively market and sell to customers worldwide via local sales and support professionals with deep expertise in target industries and through partnerships with ISVs and system integrators. Additionally, we plan to increase data center capacity by opening additional data centers in our top global markets. Encouraging the development of third-party apps on our cloud computing platforms. The Salesforce1 Platform enables existing customers, ISVs and third-party developers to create and deliver cloud apps. It is a platform on which apps can be created, tested, published and run. In addition, these apps can be marketed and sold on the AppExchange, our online marketplace for business apps, or sold directly by software vendors. We believe our ecosystem of developers and software vendors will address the business requirements of both current and potential customers. Technology, Development and Operations We deliver our Salesforce solutions as highly scalable, cloud-computing application and platform services on a multi-tenant technology architecture. Multi-tenancy is an architectural approach that allows us to operate a single application instance for multiple organizations, treating all customers as separate tenants who run in virtual isolation from each other. Customers can use and customize an application as though they each have a separate instance, yet their data and customizations remain secure and insulated from the activities of all other tenants. Our multi-tenant services run on a single stack of hardware and software, which is comprised of commercially available hardware and a combination of proprietary and commercially available software. As a result, we are able to spread the cost of delivering our services across our user base. In addition, because we do not have to manage thousands of distinct applications with their own business logic and database schemas, we believe that we can scale our business faster than traditional software vendors. Moreover, we can focus our resources on building new functionality to deliver to our customer base as a whole rather than on maintaining an infrastructure to support each of their distinct applications. Multi-tenancy also allows for faster bug and security fixes, automatic software updates and the ability to deploy major releases and frequent, incremental improvements to our services, benefiting the entire user community. Our services are optimized to run on specific databases and operating systems using the tools and platforms best suited to serve our customers rather than on-premise software that must be written to the different hardware, operating systems and database platforms existing within a customers unique systems environment. Our developers build and support solutions and features on a single code base on our chosen technology platform. Our research and development efforts are focused on improving and enhancing the features, functionality and security of our existing service offerings as well as developing new features, functionality and services. From time to time, we supplement our internal research and development activities with outside development resources and acquired technology. As part of our business strategy, we periodically acquire companies or technologies, and we incorporate the acquired technologies into our solutions. Performance, functional depth and the usability of our solutions influence our technology decisions and product direction. Our customers access our services from any geography over the Internet via all of the major Internet browsers and on most major mobile device operating systems. We provide the majority of our services to our customers from infrastructure operated by us but secured within third-party data center hosting facilities located in the United States and other countries. These third-party data center providers provide space, physical security, continuous power and cooling. The remainder of our services operate from cloud computing platform providers who offer Infrastructure as a Service, including servers, storage, databases and networking. Sources of Revenue We derive our revenues primarily from subscription fees for our service. We also derive revenues from premier support, which provides customers with additional support beyond the standard support that is included in the basic subscription fee. We recognize subscription and support revenue ratably over the contract term, beginning on the commencement date of each contract. The majority of our professional services contracts are on a time and materials basis, for which we generally recognize revenue as the services are rendered. Amounts that have been invoiced are recorded in accounts receivable and in deferred revenue or revenue, depending on whether the revenue recognition criteria have been met. Deferred revenue primarily consists of billings or payments received in advance of revenue recognition from subscription services described above and is recognized as the revenue recognition criteria are met. Unbilled deferred revenue represents future billings under our subscription agreements that have not been invoiced and, accordingly, are not recorded in deferred revenue. We generally invoice customers in annual installments. Deferred revenue and unbilled deferred revenue are influenced by several factors, including new business seasonality within the year, the specific timing, size and duration of large customer subscription agreements, the timing and compounding effects of customer renewals, varying billing cycles of subscription agreements, invoice timing, foreign currency fluctuations and new business linearity within the quarter. Customers We sell to businesses of all sizes and in almost every industry worldwide. The number of paying subscriptions at each of our customers ranges from one to hundreds of thousands. None of our customers accounted for more than five percent of our revenues in fiscal 2015 , 2014 or 2013 . Transactions Our transaction volume, representing transactions processed through our solutions and platform, excluding Marketing Cloud and one of our platform service offerings, Heroku, was 585 billion for fiscal 2015, an increase of 59 percent as compared to fiscal 2014. A transaction is a retrieval or update within the Salesforce database, which can be a page load, an information query, or an API call, among others. Our transaction metrics are used to illustrate the growing usage of our service by our customers and to highlight the scalability of our service. We do not believe transaction metrics are key performance indicators of our financial condition. Specifically, there is no direct correlation between the transaction activity and our financial results, such as revenue or expense growth. Additionally, transaction activity cannot be relied upon as an indicator of future financial performance. Sales, Marketing and Customer Support We organize our sales and marketing programs by geographic regions, including the Americas, Europe and Asia Pacific, which includes Japan. The majority of our revenue from the Americas is attributable to customers in the United States. Approximately 28 percent of our revenue comes from customers outside of the Americas. Direct Sales We sell our services primarily through our direct sales force, which is comprised of telephone sales personnel based in regional hubs, and field sales personnel based in territories close to their customers. Both our telephone sales and field sales personnel are supported by sales representatives, who are primarily responsible for generating qualified sales leads. Referral and Indirect Sales We have a network of partners who refer sales leads to us and who then assist in selling to these prospects. This network includes global consulting firms, systems integrators and regional partners. In return, we typically pay these partners a fee based on the first-year subscription revenue generated by the customers whom they refer. Also included in this network are ISVs, whom we typically pay a percentage of the subscription revenue generated by their referrals. We continue to invest in developing additional distribution channels for our subscription service. Marketing Our marketing strategy is to promote our brand and generate demand for our offerings. We use a variety of marketing programs across traditional and social channels to target our prospective and current customers, partners, and developers. Our primary marketing activities include: ##TABLE_START  Press and industry analyst relations to garner third-party validation and generate positive coverage for our company, offerings and value proposition; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  User conferences and events, such as Dreamforce, as well as participation in trade shows and industry events, to create customer and prospect awareness; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Content marketing and engagement on social channels like Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn and YouTube; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Search engine marketing and advertising to drive traffic to our Web properties; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Web site development to engage and educate prospects and generate interest through product information and demonstrations, free trials, case studies, white papers, and marketing collateral; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Multi-channel marketing campaigns; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Customer testimonials; and ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Sales tools and field marketing events to enable our sales organization to more effectively convert leads into customers. ##TABLE_END Customer Service and Support Our global customer support group responds to both business and technical inquiries about the use of our products via the web, telephone, email, social networks and other channels. We provide standard customer support during regular business hours at no charge to customers who purchase any of our paying subscription editions. We also offer premier customer support for an additional fee, which can include services such as priority access to technical resources, developer support, and system administration. In addition, we offer a mission critical support add-on that is designed to provide customers with responses for incidents from a dedicated team knowledgeable about the customer's specific enterprise architecture, and which offers instruction to optimize their usage of our products. Seasonality Our fourth quarter has historically been our strongest quarter for new business and renewals, and our first quarter is historically our largest collections and operating cash flow quarter. For a more detailed discussion, see the Seasonal Nature of Deferred Revenue and Accounts Receivable discussion in Managements Discussion and Analysis. Competition The market for our offerings is highly competitive, rapidly evolving and fragmented, and subject to changing technology and frequent introductions of new products and services. Many prospective customers have invested substantial personnel and financial resources to implement and integrate their current enterprise software into their businesses and therefore may be reluctant or unwilling to migrate away from their current solution to an enterprise cloud computing application service. Additionally, third-party developers may be reluctant to build application services on our platform since they have invested in other competing technology platforms. We compete primarily with vendors of packaged business software and companies offering CRM apps. We also compete with internally developed apps. We may encounter competition from enterprise software vendors who may develop toolsets and products that allow customers to build new apps that run on the customers current infrastructure or as hosted services. Our current principal competitors include: ##TABLE_START  On premise offerings from enterprise software application vendors; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Cloud computing application service providers; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Software companies that provide their product or service free of charge, and only charge a premium for advanced features and functionality; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Social media companies; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Traditional platform development environment companies, ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Cloud computing development platform companies; and ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Internally developed applications (by our potential customers information technology (IT) departments). ##TABLE_END We believe that as traditional enterprise software application and platform vendors shift more of their focus to cloud computing, they may become a greater competitive threat. Intellectual Property We rely on a combination of trademark, copyright, trade secret and patent laws in the United States and other jurisdictions as well as confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions to protect our proprietary technology and our brands and maintain programs to protect and grow our rights. We also enter into confidentiality and proprietary rights agreements with our employees, consultants and other third parties and control access to software, services, documentation and other proprietary information. We believe the duration of our patents is adequate relative to the expected lives of our service offerings. Employees As of January 31, 2015, we had more than 16,000 employees. None of our employees in the United States is represented by a labor union, however, for certain foreign subsidiaries, workers councils represent our employees.

RISK FACTORS ##TABLE_END The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones facing us. Other events that we do not currently anticipate or that we currently deem immaterial also may affect our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. Risks Related to Our Business and Industry Defects or disruptions in our services could diminish demand for our services and subject us to substantial liability. Because our services are complex and incorporate a variety of hardware and proprietary and third-party software, our services may have errors or defects that could result in unanticipated downtime for our subscribers and harm to our reputation and our business. Cloud services frequently contain undetected errors when first introduced or when new versions or enhancements are released. We have from time to time found defects in our services and new errors in our services may be detected in the future. In addition, our customers may use our services in unanticipated ways that may cause a disruption in services for other customers attempting to access their data. As we acquire companies, we may encounter difficulty in incorporating the acquired technologies into our services and maintaining the quality standards that are consistent with our brand and reputation. Since our customers use our services for important aspects of their business, any errors, defects, disruptions in service or other performance problems could hurt our reputation and may damage our customers businesses. As a result, customers could elect to not renew our services or delay or withhold payment to us. We could also lose future sales or customers may make warranty or other claims against us, which could result in an increase in our provision for doubtful accounts, an increase in collection cycles for accounts receivable or the expense and risk of litigation. Interruptions or delays in services from our third-party data center hosting facilities or cloud computing platform providers could impair the delivery of our services and harm our business. We currently serve our customers from third-party data center hosting facilities and cloud computing platform providers located in the United States and other countries. Any damage to, or failure of, our systems generally could result in interruptions in our services. Interruptions in our services may reduce our revenue, cause us to issue credits or pay penalties, cause customers to terminate their subscriptions and adversely affect our attrition rates and our ability to attract new customers, all of which would reduce our revenue. Our business would also be harmed if our customers and potential customers believe our services are unreliable. As part of our current disaster recovery arrangements, our production environment and all of our customers data is currently replicated in near real-time in a facility located in the United States. Companies and products added through acquisition may be served through alternate facilities. We do not control the operation of any of these facilities, and they may be vulnerable to damage or interruption from earthquakes, floods, fires, power loss, telecommunications failures and similar events. They may also be subject to break-ins, sabotage, intentional acts of vandalism and similar misconduct. Despite precautions taken at these facilities, the occurrence of a natural disaster or an act of terrorism, a decision to close the facilities without adequate notice or other unanticipated problems at these facilities could result in lengthy interruptions in our services. Even with disaster recovery arrangements, our services could be interrupted. As we continue to add data centers and add capacity in our existing data centers, we may move or transfer our data and our customers data. Despite precautions taken during this process, any unsuccessful data transfers may impair the delivery of our services, which may damage our business. If our security measures or those of our third-party data center hosting facilities, cloud computing platform providers, or third-party service partners, are breached, and unauthorized access is obtained to a customers data, our data or our IT systems, our services may be perceived as not being secure, customers may curtail or stop using our services, and we may incur significant legal and financial exposure and liabilities. Our services involve the storage and transmission of customers proprietary information, and security breaches could expose us to a risk of loss of this information, litigation and possible liability. While we have security measures in place, they may be breached as a result of third-party action, including intentional misconduct by computer hackers, employee error, malfeasance or otherwise and result in someone obtaining unauthorized access to our IT data, our customers data or our data, including our intellectual property and other confidential business information. Additionally, third parties may attempt to fraudulently induce employees or customers into disclosing sensitive information such as user names, passwords or other information in order to gain access to our customers data, our data or our IT systems. Because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access, or to sabotage systems, change frequently and generally are not recognized until launched against a target, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures. In addition, our customers may authorize third-party technology providers to access their customer data, and some of our customers may not have adequate security measures in place to protect their data that is stored on our services. Because we do not control our customers or third-party technology providers, or the processing of such data by third-party technology providers, we cannot ensure the integrity or security of such transmissions or processing. Malicious third parties may also conduct attacks designed to temporarily deny customers access to our services. Any security breach could result in a loss of confidence in the security of our services, damage our reputation, negatively impact our future sales, disrupt our business and lead to legal liability. As we acquire and invest in companies or technologies, we may not realize the expected business or financial benefits and the acquisitions could prove difficult to integrate, disrupt our business, dilute stockholder value and adversely affect our operating results and the market value of our common stock. As part of our business strategy, we periodically make investments in, or acquisitions of, complementary businesses, joint ventures, services and technologies and intellectual property rights, and we expect that we will continue to make such investments and acquisitions in the future. Acquisitions and investments involve numerous risks, including:  potential failure to achieve the expected benefits of the combination or acquisition;  difficulties in, and the cost of, integrating operations, technologies, services and personnel;  diversion of financial and managerial resources from existing operations; ##TABLE_START  the potential entry into new markets in which we have little or no experience or where competitors may have stronger market positions; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  potential write-offs of acquired assets or investments, and potential financial and credit risks associated with acquired customers; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  potential loss of key employees of the acquired company; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  inability to generate sufficient revenue to offset acquisition or investment costs; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  inability to maintain relationships with customers and partners of the acquired business; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  difficulty of transitioning the acquired technology onto our existing platforms and maintaining the security standards for such technology consistent with our other services; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  potential unknown liabilities associated with the acquired businesses; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  unanticipated expenses related to acquired technology and its integration into our existing technology; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  negative impact to our results of operations because of the depreciation and amortization of amounts related to acquired intangible assets, fixed assets and deferred compensation, and the loss of acquired deferred revenue and unbilled deferred revenue; ##TABLE_END 10 ##TABLE_START  delays in customer purchases due to uncertainty related to any acquisition; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  the need to implement controls, procedures and policies at the acquired company; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  challenges caused by distance, language and cultural differences; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  in the case of foreign acquisitions, the challenges associated with integrating operations across different cultures and languages and any currency and regulatory risks associated with specific countries; and ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  the tax effects of any such acquisitions. ##TABLE_END Any of these risks could harm our business. In addition, if we finance acquisitions by issuing equity or convertible or other debt securities or loans, our existing stockholders may be diluted, or we could face constraints related to the terms of and repayment obligation related to the incurrence of indebtedness that could affect the market price of our common stock. Also, valuations of privately-held companies are inherently complex due to the lack of readily available market data. If we determine that any of our investments in such companies have experienced a decline in fair value, we may be required to record an impairment, which could negatively impact our financial results. Privacy concerns and laws, evolving regulation of cloud computing, cross-border data transfer restrictions and other domestic or foreign regulations may limit the use and adoption of our services and adversely affect our business. Regulation related to the provision of services on the Internet is increasing, as federal, state and foreign governments continue to adopt new laws and regulations addressing data privacy and the collection, processing, storage and use of personal information. In some cases, foreign data privacy laws and regulations, such as the European Unions Data Protection Directive, and the country-specific regulations that implement that directive, also govern the processing of personal information. Further, laws are increasingly aimed at the use of personal information for marketing purposes, such as the European Unions e-Privacy Directive, and the country-specific regulations that implement that directive. Such laws and regulations are subject to differing interpretations and may be inconsistent among jurisdictions. These and other requirements could reduce demand for our services or restrict our ability to store and process data or, in some cases, impact our ability to offer our services in certain locations or our customers' ability to deploy our solutions globally. In addition to government activity, privacy advocacy and other industry groups have established or may establish new self-regulatory standards that may place additional burdens on us. Our customers expect us to meet voluntary certification or other standards established by third parties, such as TRUSTe. If we are unable to maintain these certifications or meet these standards, it could adversely affect our ability to provide our solutions to certain customers and could harm our business. The costs of compliance with and other burdens imposed by laws, regulations and standards may limit the use and adoption of our services and reduce overall demand for it, or lead to significant fines, penalties or liabilities for any noncompliance. Furthermore, concerns regarding data privacy may cause our customers customers to resist providing the data necessary to allow our customers to use our services effectively. Even the perception that the privacy of personal information is not satisfactorily protected or does not meet regulatory requirements could inhibit sales of our products or services, and could limit adoption of our cloud-based solutions. Industry-specific regulation and other requirements and standards are evolving and unfavorable industry-specific laws, regulations, interpretive positions or standards could harm our business. Our customers and potential customers conduct business in a variety of industries, including financial services, the public sector, healthcare and telecommunications. Regulators in certain industries have adopted and may in the future adopt regulations or interpretive positions regarding the use of cloud computing and other outsourced services. The costs of compliance with, and other burdens imposed by, industry-specific laws, regulations and interpretive positions may limit our customers use and adoption of our services and reduce overall demand for our services. Compliance with these regulations may also require us to devote greater resources to support certain customers, which may increase costs and lengthen sales cycles. For example, some financial services regulators have imposed guidelines for use of cloud computing services that mandate specific controls or require financial services enterprises to obtain regulatory approval prior to outsourcing certain functions. If we are unable to comply with these guidelines or controls, or if our customers are unable to obtain regulatory approval to use our services where required, our business may be harmed. In addition, an inability to satisfy the standards of certain voluntary third-party certification bodies that our customers may expect, such as an attestation of compliance with the Payment Card Industry (PCI) Data Security Standards, may have an adverse impact on our business. Further, there are various statutes and regulations relevant to the direct email marketing and text-messaging industries, including the Telephone Consumer Protection Act (TCPA). The interpretation of many of these statutes and regulations is evolving in the courts and administrative agencies and an inability to comply with them may have an adverse impact on our business. If in the future we are unable to achieve or maintain these industry-specific certifications or other requirements or standards relevant to our customers, it may harm our business. In some cases, industry-specific laws, regulations or interpretive positions may also apply directly to us as a service provider. Any failure or perceived failure by us to comply with such requirements could have an adverse impact on our business.  If we experience significant fluctuations in our rate of anticipated growth and fail to balance our expenses with our revenue forecasts, our results could be harmed. Due to the pace of change and innovation in enterprise cloud computing services and the unpredictability of future general economic and financial market conditions and the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, we may not be able to accurately forecast our rate of growth. We plan our expense levels and investment on estimates of future revenue and future anticipated rate of growth. We may not be able to adjust our spending appropriately if the addition of new subscriptions or the renewals of existing subscriptions fall short of our expectations. A portion of our expenses may also be fixed in nature for some minimum amount of time, such as with a data center contract or office lease, so it may not be possible to reduce costs in a timely manner or without the payment of fees to exit certain obligations early. As a result, we expect that our revenues, operating results and cash flows may fluctuate significantly on a quarterly basis. Our recent revenue growth rates may not be sustainable and may decline in the future. We believe that historical period-to-period comparisons of our revenues, operating results and cash flows may not be meaningful and should not be relied upon as an indication of future performance. We rely on third-party computer hardware, software and cloud computing platforms that could cause errors in, or failures of, our services and may be difficult to replace. We rely on computer hardware purchased or leased from, software licensed from, and cloud computing platforms provided by, third parties in order to offer our services, including database software and hardware from a variety of vendors. Any errors or defects in third-party hardware, software or cloud computing platforms could result in errors in, or a failure of, our services, which could harm our business. These hardware, software and cloud computing platforms may not continue to be available at reasonable prices, on commercially reasonable terms or at all. Any loss of the right to use any of these hardware, software or cloud computing platforms could significantly increase our expenses and otherwise result in delays in the provisioning of our services until equivalent technology is either developed by us, or, if available, is identified, obtained through purchase or license and integrated into our services. The market in which we participate is intensely competitive, and if we do not compete effectively, our operating results could be harmed. The market for enterprise applications and platform services is highly competitive, rapidly evolving and fragmented, and subject to changing technology, shifting customer needs and frequent introductions of new products and services. We compete primarily with vendors of packaged CRM software and companies offering on-demand CRM applications. We also compete with internally developed applications and face competition from enterprise software vendors and online service providers who may develop toolsets and products that allow customers to build new applications that run on the customers current infrastructure or as hosted services. Our current competitors include: ##TABLE_START  on premise offerings from enterprise software application vendors; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  cloud computing application service providers; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  software companies that provide their product or service free of charge, and only charge a premium for advanced features and functionality; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  social media companies; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  traditional platform development environment companies; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  cloud computing development platform companies; and ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  internally developed applications (by our potential customers' IT departments). ##TABLE_END Many of our current and potential competitors enjoy substantial competitive advantages, such as greater name recognition, longer operating histories and larger marketing budgets, as well as substantially greater financial, technical and other resources. In addition, many of our current and potential competitors have established marketing relationships and access to larger customer bases, and have major distribution agreements with consultants, system integrators and resellers. As a result, our competitors may be able to respond more quickly and effectively than we can to new or changing opportunities, technologies, standards or customer requirements. Furthermore, because of these advantages, even if our services are more effective than the products and services that our competitors offer, potential customers might select competitive products and services in lieu of purchasing our services. For all of these reasons, we may not be able to compete successfully against our current and future competitors. Our quarterly results are likely to fluctuate and our stock price and the value of our common stock could decline substantially. Our quarterly results are likely to fluctuate. For example, our fiscal fourth quarter has historically been our strongest quarter for new business and renewals. The year-over-year compounding effect of this seasonality in billing patterns and overall new business and renewal activity causes the value of invoices that we generate in the fourth quarter to continually increase in proportion to our billings in the other three quarters of our fiscal year. As a result, our fiscal first quarter has become our largest collections and operating cash flow quarter. Additionally, some of the important factors that may cause our revenues, operating results and cash flows to fluctuate from quarter to quarter include: ##TABLE_START  our ability to retain and increase sales to existing customers, attract new customers and satisfy our customers requirements; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  the attrition rates for our services; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  the amount and timing of operating costs and capital expenditures related to the operations and expansion of our business; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  changes in deferred revenue and unbilled deferred revenue balances, which are not reflected in the balance sheet, due to seasonality, the compounding effects of renewals, invoice duration, size, invoice timing and new business linearity between quarters and within a quarter; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  changes in foreign currency exchange rates; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  the number of new employees; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  changes in our pricing policies and terms of contracts, whether initiated by us or as a result of competition; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  the cost, timing and management effort for the introduction of new features to our services; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  the costs associated with acquiring new businesses and technologies and the follow-on costs of integration and consolidating the results of acquired businesses; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  the rate of expansion and productivity of our sales force; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  the length of the sales cycle for our services; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  new product and service introductions by our competitors; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  our success in selling our services to large enterprises; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  variations in the revenue mix of editions of our services; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  technical difficulties or interruptions in our services; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  expenses related to our real estate, our office leases and our data center capacity and expansion; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  changes in interest rates and our mix of investments, which would impact the return on our investments in cash and marketable securities; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  conditions, particularly sudden changes, in the financial markets, which have impacted and may continue to impact the value of and liquidity of our investment portfolio; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  income tax effects; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  our ability to realize benefits from strategic partnerships, acquisition or investments; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  expenses related to significant, unusual or discrete events, which are recorded in the period in which the events occur; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  general economic conditions, which may adversely affect either our customers ability or willingness to purchase additional subscriptions or upgrade their services, or delay a prospective customer's purchasing decision, reduce the value of new subscription contracts, or affect attrition rates; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  timing of additional investments in our enterprise cloud computing application and platform services and in our consulting services; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  regulatory compliance costs; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  the timing of customer payments and payment defaults by customers; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  extraordinary expenses such as litigation or other dispute-related settlement payments; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  the impact of new accounting pronouncements; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  equity issuances, including as consideration in acquisitions or due to the conversion of our outstanding convertible notes at the election of the note holders; ##TABLE_END 13 ##TABLE_START  the timing of stock awards to employees and the related adverse financial statement impact of having to expense those stock awards on a straight-line basis over their vesting schedules; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  the timing of commission, bonus, and other compensation payments to employees; and ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  the timing of payroll and other withholding tax expenses, which are triggered by the payment of bonuses and when employees exercise their vested stock awards. ##TABLE_END Many of these factors are outside of our control, and the occurrence of one or more of them might cause our operating results to vary widely. As such, we believe that historical quarter-to-quarter comparisons of our revenues, operating results, changes in our deferred revenue and unbilled deferred revenue balances and cash flows may not be meaningful and should not be relied upon as an indication of future performance. Additionally, if we fail to meet or exceed the expectations of securities analysts and investors, or if one or more of the securities analysts who cover us adversely change their recommendation regarding our stock, the market price of our common stock could decline. Moreover, our stock price may be based on expectations, estimates and forecasts of our future performance that may be unrealistic or that may not be met. Further, our stock price may fluctuate based on reporting by the financial media, including television, radio and press reports and blogs. Our efforts to expand our services beyond the CRM market and to develop our existing services in order to keep pace with technological developments may not succeed and may reduce our revenue growth rate and harm our business. We derive substantially all of our revenue from subscriptions to our CRM enterprise cloud computing application services, and we expect this will continue for the foreseeable future. The markets for our Analytics Cloud and Community Cloud remain relatively new and it is uncertain whether our efforts will ever result in significant revenue for us. Further, the introduction of new services beyond the CRM market may not be successful, and early stage interest and adoption of such new services may not result in long term success or significant revenue for us. Our efforts to expand our services beyond the CRM market may not succeed and may reduce our revenue growth rate. Additionally, if we are unable to develop enhancements to and new features for our existing or new services that keep pace with rapid technological developments, our business will be harmed. The success of enhancements, new features and services depends on several factors, including the timely completion, introduction and market acceptance of the feature, service or enhancement. Failure in this regard may significantly impair our revenue growth. In addition, because our services are designed to operate on a variety of network hardware and software platforms using a standard browser, we will need to continuously modify and enhance our services to keep pace with changes in Internet-related hardware, software, communication, browser and database technologies. We may not be successful in either developing these modifications and enhancements or in bringing them to market timely. Furthermore, uncertainties about the timing and nature of new network platforms or technologies, or modifications to existing platforms or technologies, could increase our research and development or service delivery expenses. Any failure of our services to operate effectively with future network platforms and technologies could reduce the demand for our services, result in customer dissatisfaction and harm our business. Sales to customers outside the United States expose us to risks inherent in international sales. We sell our services throughout the world and are subject to risks and challenges associated with international business. Historically, sales in Europe and Asia Pacific together have represented approximately 30 percent of our total revenues, and we intend to continue to expand our international sales efforts. The risks and challenges associated with sales to customers outside the United States include: ##TABLE_START  localization of our services, including translation into foreign languages and associated expenses; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  laws and business practices favoring local competitors; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  pressure on the creditworthiness of sovereign nations, particularly in Europe, where we have customers and a balance of our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  liquidity issues or political actions by sovereign nations, which could result in decreased values of these balances; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  foreign currency fluctuations and controls; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  compliance with multiple, conflicting and changing governmental laws and regulations, including employment, tax, privacy, anti-corruption, import/export, antitrust, data protection and industry-specific laws and regulations, including rules related to compliance by our third-party resellers; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  regional data privacy laws and other regulatory requirements that apply to outsourced service providers and to the transmission of our customers data across international borders; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  treatment of revenue from international sources and changes to tax codes, including being subject to foreign tax laws and being liable for paying withholding income or other taxes in foreign jurisdictions; ##TABLE_END 14 ##TABLE_START  different pricing environments; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  different or lesser protection of our intellectual property; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  longer accounts receivable payment cycles and other collection difficulties; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  natural disasters, acts of war, terrorism, pandemics or security breaches; and ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  regional economic and political conditions. ##TABLE_END Any of these factors could negatively impact our business and results of operations. Additionally, our international subscription fees are paid either in U.S. dollars or local currency. As a result, fluctuations in the value of the U.S. dollar and foreign currencies may make our services more expensive for international customers, which could harm our business. Because we recognize revenue from subscriptions for our services over the term of the subscription, downturns or upturns in new business may not be immediately reflected in our operating results. We generally recognize revenue from customers ratably over the terms of their subscription agreements, which are typically 12 to 36 months. As a result, most of the revenue we report in each quarter is the result of subscription agreements entered into during previous quarters. Consequently, a decline in new or renewed subscriptions in any one quarter may not be reflected in our revenue results for that quarter. Any such decline, however, will negatively affect our revenue in future quarters. Accordingly, the effect of significant downturns in sales and market acceptance of our services, and potential changes in our attrition rate, may not be fully reflected in our results of operations until future periods. Our subscription model also makes it difficult for us to rapidly increase our revenue through additional sales in any period, as revenue from new customers must be recognized over the applicable subscription term.  If our customers do not renew their subscriptions for our services or reduce the number of paying subscriptions at the time of renewal, our revenue will decline and our business will suffer. If we cannot accurately predict subscription renewals or upgrade rates, we may not meet our revenue targets which may adversely affect the market price of our common stock. Our customers have no obligation to renew their subscriptions for our services after the expiration of their initial subscription period, which is typically 12 to 36 months, and in the normal course of business, some customers have elected not to renew. In addition, our customers may renew for fewer subscriptions, renew for shorter contract lengths, or switch to lower cost offerings of our services. We cannot accurately predict attrition rates given our varied customer base of enterprise and small and medium size business customers and the number of multi-year subscription contracts. Our attrition rates may increase or fluctuate as a result of a number of factors, including customer dissatisfaction with our services, customers spending levels, decreases in the number of users at our customers, pricing changes and deteriorating general economic conditions. Our future success also depends in part on our ability to sell additional features and services, more subscriptions or enhanced editions of our services to our current customers. This may also require increasingly sophisticated and costly sales efforts that are targeted at senior management. Similarly, the rate at which our customers purchase new or enhanced services depends on a number of factors, including general economic conditions and that our customers do not react negatively to any price changes related to these additional features and services. If our efforts to upsell to our customers are not successful our business may suffer.  If the market for our technology delivery model and enterprise cloud computing services develops more slowly than we expect, our business could be harmed. Our success depends on the willingness of third-party developers to build applications that are complementary to our services. Without the development of these applications, both current and potential customers may not find our services sufficiently attractive. In addition, for those customers who authorize a third-party technology partner access to their data, we do not provide any warranty related to the functionality, security and integrity of the data transmission or processing. Despite contract provisions to protect us, customers may look to us to support and provide warranties for the third-party applications, which may expose us to potential claims, liabilities and obligations for applications we did not develop or sell, all of which could harm our business. Supporting our existing and growing customer base could strain our personnel resources and infrastructure, and if we are unable to scale our operations and increase productivity, we may not be able to successfully implement our business plan. We continue to experience significant growth in our customer base and personnel, which has placed a strain on our management, administrative, operational and financial infrastructure. We anticipate that additional investments in our internal infrastructure, data center capacity, research, customer support and development, and real estate spending will be required to scale our operations and increase productivity, to address the needs of our customers, to further develop and enhance our services, to expand into new geographic areas, and to scale with our overall growth. If we fail to successfully scale our operations and increase productivity, we will be unable to execute our business plan. We regularly upgrade or replace our various software systems. If the implementations of these new applications are delayed, or if we encounter unforeseen problems with our new systems or in migrating away from our existing applications and systems, our operations and our ability to manage our business could be negatively impacted. Our success will depend in part upon the ability of our senior management to manage our projected growth effectively. To do so, we must continue to increase the productivity of our existing employees and to hire, train and manage new employees as needed. To manage the expected domestic and international growth of our operations and personnel, we will need to continue to improve our operational, financial and management controls, our reporting systems and procedures, and our utilization of real estate. The additional investments we are making will increase our cost base, which will make it more difficult for us to offset any future revenue shortfalls by reducing expenses in the short term. As more of our sales efforts are targeted at larger enterprise customers, our sales cycle may become more time-consuming and expensive, we may encounter pricing pressure and implementation and customization challenges, and we may have to delay revenue recognition for some complex transactions, all of which could harm our business and operating results. As we target more of our sales efforts at larger enterprise customers, we may face greater costs, longer sales cycles, greater competition and less predictability in completing some of our sales. In this market segment, the customers decision to use our services may be an enterprise-wide decision and, if so, these types of sales would require us to provide greater levels of education regarding the use and benefits of our services, as well as education regarding privacy and data protection laws and regulations to prospective customers with international operations. In addition, larger customers may demand more customization, integration services and features. As a result of these factors, these sales opportunities may require us to devote greater sales support and professional services resources to individual customers, driving up costs and time required to complete sales and diverting our own sales and professional services resources to a smaller number of larger transactions, while potentially requiring us to delay revenue recognition on some of these transactions until the technical or implementation requirements have been met. Pricing and packaging strategies for enterprise and other customers for subscriptions to our existing and future service offerings may not be widely accepted by other new or existing customers. Our adoption of such new pricing and packaging strategies may harm our business. For large enterprise customers, professional services may also be performed by a third party or a combination of our own staff and a third party. Our strategy is to work with third parties to increase the breadth of capability and depth of capacity for delivery of these services to our customers. If a customer is not satisfied with the quality of work performed by us or a third party or with the type of services or solutions delivered, then we could incur additional costs to address the situation, the profitability of that work might be impaired, and the customers dissatisfaction with our services could damage our ability to obtain additional work from that customer. In addition, negative publicity related to our customer relationships, regardless of its accuracy, may further damage our business by affecting our ability to compete for new business with current and prospective customers. We have been and may in the future be sued by third parties for various claims including alleged infringement of proprietary rights. We are involved in various legal matters arising from the normal course of business activities. These may include claims, suits, government investigations and other proceedings involving alleged infringement of third-party patents and other intellectual property rights, and commercial, corporate and securities, labor and employment, wage and hour, and other matters. The software and Internet industries are characterized by the existence of a large number of patents, trademarks and copyrights and by frequent litigation based on allegations of infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights. We have received in the past and may receive in the future communications from third parties, including practicing entities and non-practicing entities, claiming that we have infringed their intellectual property rights. In addition, we have been, and may in the future be, sued by third parties for alleged infringement of their claimed proprietary rights. For example, during fiscal 2015, we received a communication from a large technology company alleging that we infringed certain of its patents. While we continue to analyze this claim and no litigation has been filed to date, there can be no assurance that this claim will not lead to litigation in the future. Our technologies may be subject to injunction if they are found to infringe the rights of a third party or we may be required to pay damages, or both. Further, many of our subscription agreements require us to indemnify our customers for third-party intellectual property infringement claims, which would increase the cost to us of an adverse ruling on such a claim. The outcome of any claims or litigation, regardless of the merits, is inherently uncertain. Any claims and lawsuits, and the disposition of such claims and lawsuits, whether through settlement or licensing discussions, or litigation, could be time-consuming and expensive to resolve, divert management attention from executing our business plan, result in efforts to enjoin our activities, lead to attempts on the part of other parties to pursue similar claims and, in the case of intellectual property claims, require us to change our technology, change our business practices, pay monetary damages or enter into short- or long-term royalty or licensing agreements. Any adverse determination related to intellectual property claims or other litigation could prevent us from offering our services to others, could be material to our financial condition or cash flows, or both, or could otherwise adversely affect our operating results. In addition, depending on the nature and timing of any such dispute, an unfavorable resolution of a legal matter could materially affect our future results of operations or cash flows or both of a particular quarter. In addition, our exposure to risks associated with various claims, including the use of intellectual property, may be increased as a result of acquisitions of other companies. For example, we may have a lower level of visibility into the development process with respect to intellectual property or the care taken to safeguard against infringement risks with respect to the acquired company or technology. In addition, third parties may make infringement and similar or related claims after we have acquired technology that had not been asserted prior to our acquisition. Any failure to protect our intellectual property rights could impair our ability to protect our proprietary technology and our brand. If we fail to protect our intellectual property rights adequately, our competitors may gain access to our technology, and our business may be harmed. In addition, defending our intellectual property rights may entail significant expense. Any of our patents, trademarks or other intellectual property rights may be challenged by others or invalidated through administrative process or litigation. While we have some U.S. patents and many U.S. and international patent applications pending, we may be unable to obtain patent protection for the technology covered in our patent applications or the patent protection may not be obtained quickly enough to meet our business needs. In addition, our existing patents and any patents issued in the future may not provide us with competitive advantages, or may be successfully challenged by third parties. Furthermore, legal standards relating to the validity, enforceability and scope of protection of intellectual property rights are uncertain, and we also may face proposals to change the scope of protection for some intellectual property rights in the U.S. Effective patent, trademark, copyright and trade secret protection may not be available to us in every country in which our services are available. The laws of some foreign countries may not be as protective of intellectual property rights as those in the U.S., and mechanisms for enforcement of intellectual property rights may be inadequate. Also, our involvement in standard setting activity or the need to obtain licenses from others may require us to license our intellectual property. Accordingly, despite our efforts, we may be unable to prevent third parties from using our intellectual property. We may be required to spend significant resources to monitor and protect our intellectual property rights and we may conclude that in at least some instances the benefits of protecting our intellectual property rights may be outweighed by the expense. We may initiate claims or litigation against third parties for infringement of our proprietary rights or to establish the validity of our proprietary rights. Any litigation, whether or not it is resolved in our favor, could result in significant expense to us and divert the efforts of our technical and management personnel. Our continued success depends on our ability to maintain and enhance our brands. We believe that the brand identities we have developed have significantly contributed to the success of our business. Maintaining and enhancing the Salesforce brand and our other brands are critical to expanding our base of customers, partners and employees. Our brand strength will depend largely on our ability to remain a technology leader and continue to provide high-quality innovative products, services, and features. In order to maintain and enhance our brands, we may be required to make substantial investments that may later prove to be unsuccessful. If we fail to maintain and enhance our brands, or if we incur excessive expenses in our efforts to do so, our business, operating results and financial condition may be materially and adversely affected. We may lose key members of our management team or development and operations personnel, and may be unable to attract and retain employees we need to support our operations and growth. Our success depends substantially upon the continued services of our executive officers and other key members of management, particularly our Chief Executive Officer. From time to time, there may be changes in our executive management team resulting from the hiring or departure of executives. Such changes in our executive management team may be disruptive to our business. We are also substantially dependent on the continued service of our existing development and operations personnel because of the complexity of our services and technologies. We do not have employment agreements with any of our executive officers, key management, development or operations personnel and they could terminate their employment with us at any time. The loss of one or more of our key employees or groups could seriously harm our business. In the technology industry, there is substantial and continuous competition for engineers with high levels of experience in designing, developing and managing software and Internet-related services, as well as competition for sales executives and operations personnel. We may not be successful in attracting and retaining qualified personnel. We have from time to time experienced, and we expect to continue to experience, difficulty in hiring and retaining highly skilled employees with appropriate qualifications. If we fail to attract new personnel or fail to retain and motivate our current personnel, our business and future growth prospects could be severely harmed. Any failure in our delivery of high-quality technical support services may adversely affect our relationships with our customers and our financial results. Our customers depend on our support organization to resolve technical issues relating to our applications. We may be unable to respond quickly enough to accommodate short-term increases in customer demand for support services. Increased customer demand for these services, without corresponding revenues, could increase costs and adversely affect our operating results. In addition, our sales process is highly dependent on our applications and business reputation and on positive recommendations from our existing customers. Any failure to maintain high-quality technical support, or a market perception that we do not maintain high-quality support, could adversely affect our reputation, our ability to sell our enterprise cloud computing solutions to existing and prospective customers, and our business, operating results and financial position. Periodic changes to our sales organization can be disruptive and may reduce our rate of growth. We periodically change and make adjustments to our sales organization in response to market opportunities, competitive threats, management changes, product introductions or enhancements, acquisitions, sales performance, increases in sales headcount, cost levels and other internal and external considerations. Any such future sales organization changes may result in a temporary reduction of productivity, which could negatively affect our rate of growth. In addition, any significant change to the way we structure our compensation of our sales organization may be disruptive and may affect our revenue growth. Unanticipated changes in our effective tax rate and additional tax liabilities may impact our operating results We are subject to income taxes in the United States and various jurisdictions outside of the United States. Our effective tax rate could fluctuate due to changes in the mix of earnings and losses in countries with differing statutory tax rates. Our tax expense could also be impacted by changes in non-deductible expenses, changes in excess tax benefits related to exercises and vesting of stock-based expense, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities and our ability to utilize them and the applicability of withholding taxes. We are subject to tax examinations in multiple jurisdictions. While we regularly evaluate new information that may change our judgment resulting in recognition, derecognition or change in measurement of a tax position taken, there can be no assurance that the final determination of any examinations will not have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial position. Our tax provision could also be impacted by changes in federal, state or international tax laws including fundamental tax law changes applicable to corporate multinationals currently being considered by many countries including the United States as well as several European countries. Additionally, we may be subject to additional tax liabilities due to changes in non-income taxes resulting from changes in federal, state or international tax laws, changes in taxing jurisdictions administrative interpretations, decisions, policies, and positions, results of tax examinations, settlements or judicial decisions, changes in accounting principles, changes to the business operations, including acquisitions, as well as the evaluation of new information that results in a change to a tax position taken in a prior period. Our debt service obligations and operating lease commitments may adversely affect our financial condition and cash flows from operations. We have a high level of debt, including our 0.25% Senior Notes due April 1, 2018, borrowings under our revolving credit facility and capital lease arrangements. Additionally, we have significant contractual commitments in operating lease arrangements, which are not reflected on our consolidated balance sheet. In addition, we have a financing obligation for a leased facility of which we are deemed the owner for accounting purposes. Our maintenance of this indebtedness could: ##TABLE_START  impair our ability to obtain additional financing in the future for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, general corporate or other purposes; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  cause us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flows from operations towards debt service obligations and principal repayments; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  make us more vulnerable to downturns in our business, our industry or the economy in general; and ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  due to limitations within the revolving credit facility covenants, restrict our ability to incur additional indebtedness, grant liens, merge or consolidate, dispose of assets, make investments, make acquisitions, enter into transactions with affiliates, pay dividends or make distributions, repurchase stock and enter into restrictive agreements, as defined in the credit agreement. ##TABLE_END Our ability to meet our expenses and debt obligations will depend on our future performance, which will be affected by financial, business, economic, regulatory and other factors. We will not be able to control many of these factors, such as economic conditions and governmental regulations. Further, our operations may not generate sufficient cash to enable us to service our debt. If we fail to make a payment on our debt, we could be in default on such debt. If we are at any time unable to generate sufficient cash flows from operations to service our indebtedness when payment is due, we may be required to attempt to renegotiate the terms of the instruments relating to the indebtedness, seek to refinance all or a portion of the indebtedness or obtain additional financing. There can be no assurance that we would be able to successfully renegotiate such terms, that any such refinancing would be possible or that any additional financing could be obtained on terms that are favorable or acceptable to us. A failure to comply with the covenants and other provisions of our outstanding debt could result in events of default under such instruments, which could permit acceleration of all of our notes and borrowings under our revolving credit facility. Any required repayment of our notes or revolving credit facility as a result of a fundamental change or other acceleration would lower our current cash on hand such that we would not have those funds available for use in our business. Weakened global economic conditions may adversely affect our industry, business and results of operations. Our overall performance depends in part on worldwide economic conditions. The United States and other key international economies have experienced cyclical downturns from time to time in which economic activity was impacted by falling demand for a variety of goods and services, restricted credit, poor liquidity, reduced corporate profitability, volatility in credit, equity and foreign exchange markets, bankruptcies and overall uncertainty with respect to the economy. These conditions affect the rate of information technology spending and could adversely affect our customers ability or willingness to purchase our enterprise cloud computing services, delay prospective customers purchasing decisions, reduce the value or duration of their subscription contracts, or affect attrition rates, all of which could adversely affect our operating results. Natural disasters and other events beyond our control could materially adversely affect us. Natural disasters or other catastrophic events may cause damage or disruption to our operations, international commerce and the global economy, and thus could have a strong negative effect on us. Our business operations are subject to interruption by natural disasters, fire, power shortages, pandemics and other events beyond our control. Although we maintain crisis management and disaster response plans, such events could make it difficult or impossible for us to deliver our services to our customers, and could decrease demand for our services. The majority of our research and development activities, corporate headquarters, information technology systems, and other critical business operations, are located near major seismic faults in the San Francisco Bay Area. Because we do not carry earthquake insurance for direct quake-related losses, with the exception of the building that we own in San Francisco, and significant recovery time could be required to resume operations, our financial condition and operating results could be materially adversely affected in the event of a major earthquake or catastrophic event. Risks Relating to Our Convertible Senior Notes and Our Common Stock The market price of our common stock is likely to be volatile and could subject us to litigation. The trading prices of the securities of technology companies have been highly volatile. Accordingly, the market price of our notes and common stock has been and is likely to continue to be subject to wide fluctuations. Factors affecting the market price of our notes and common stock include: ##TABLE_START  variations in our operating results, earnings per share, cash flows from operating activities, deferred revenue and other financial metrics and non-financial metrics, and how those results compare to analyst expectations; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  forward-looking guidance to industry and financial analysts related to future revenue and earnings per share; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  changes in the estimates of our operating results or changes in recommendations by securities analysts that elect to follow our common stock; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  announcements of technological innovations, new services or service enhancements, strategic alliances or significant agreements by us or by our competitors; ##TABLE_END 19 ##TABLE_START  announcements by us or by our competitors of mergers or other strategic acquisitions, or rumors of such transactions involving us or our competitors; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  announcements of customer additions and customer cancellations or delays in customer purchases; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  recruitment or departure of key personnel; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  disruptions in our service due to computer hardware, software, network or data center problems; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  the economy as a whole, market conditions in our industry and the industries of our customers; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  trading activity by a limited number of stockholders who together beneficially own a significant portion of our outstanding common stock; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  the issuance of shares of common stock by us, whether in connection with an acquisition, a capital raising transaction or upon conversion of some or all of our outstanding convertible senior notes; and ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  issuance of debt or other convertible securities. ##TABLE_END In addition, if the market for technology stocks or the stock market in general experiences uneven investor confidence, the market price of our notes and common stock could decline for reasons unrelated to our business, operating results or financial condition. The market price of our notes and common stock might also decline in reaction to events that affect other companies within, or outside, our industry even if these events do not directly affect us. Some companies that have experienced volatility in the trading price of their stock have been the subject of securities class action litigation. If we are the subject of such litigation, it could result in substantial costs and a diversion of managements attention and resources. We may issue additional shares of our common stock or instruments convertible into shares of our common stock, including in connection with the conversion of the notes, and thereby materially and adversely affect the market price of our common stock and the trading price of the notes. We are not restricted from issuing additional shares of our common stock or other instruments convertible into, or exchangeable or exercisable for, shares of our common stock during the life of the notes. If we issue additional shares of our common stock or instruments convertible into shares of our common stock, it may materially and adversely affect the market price of our common stock and, in turn, the trading price of the notes. In addition, the conversion of some or all of the notes may dilute the ownership interests of existing holders of our common stock, and any sales in the public market of any shares of our common stock issuable upon such conversion of the notes could adversely affect the prevailing market price of our common stock. In addition, the potential conversion of the notes could depress the market price of our common stock. We may not have the ability to raise the funds necessary to pay the amount of cash due upon conversion of the notes or the fundamental change purchase price due when a holder submits its notes for purchase upon the occurrence of a fundamental change. Upon the occurrence of a fundamental change, holders of the notes may require us to purchase, for cash, all or a portion of their notes. In addition, if a holder converts its notes, we will generally pay such holder an amount of cash before delivering to such holder any shares of our common stock. There can be no assurance that we will have sufficient financial resources, or will be able to arrange financing, to pay the fundamental change purchase price if holders submit their notes for purchase by us upon the occurrence of a fundamental change or to pay the amount of cash due if holders surrender their notes for conversion. In addition, agreements governing any future debt may restrict our ability to make each of the required cash payments even if we have sufficient funds to make them. Furthermore, our ability to purchase the notes or to pay cash upon the conversion of the notes may be limited by law or regulatory authority. If we fail to purchase the notes, to pay interest due on, or to pay the amount of cash due upon conversion, we will be in default under the indenture, which in turn may result in the acceleration of other indebtedness we may then have. If the repayment of the other indebtedness were to be accelerated, we may not have sufficient funds to repay that indebtedness and to purchase the notes or to pay the amount of cash due upon conversion. Our inability to pay for the notes that are tendered for purchase or upon conversion could result in note holders receiving substantially less than the principal amount of the notes, which could harm our reputation, financing opportunities and our business. The fundamental change provisions may delay or prevent an otherwise beneficial takeover attempt of us. The fundamental change purchase rights will allow holders of the notes to require us to purchase all or a portion of their notes upon the occurrence of a fundamental change. The provisions requiring an increase to the conversion rate for conversions in connection with a make-whole fundamental change may, in certain circumstances, delay or prevent a takeover of us and the removal of incumbent management that might otherwise be beneficial to investors.  The convertible note hedges and warrant transactions may affect the trading price of the notes and the market price of our common stock. We entered into privately negotiated convertible note hedge transactions with certain hedge counterparties concurrently with the pricing of the notes. We also entered into privately negotiated warrant transactions with the hedge counterparties. Taken together, the convertible note hedge transactions and the warrant transactions are expected, but not guaranteed, to reduce the potential dilution with respect to our common stock upon conversion of the notes. If, however, the price of our common stock, as measured under the terms of the warrant transactions, exceeds the exercise price of the warrant transactions, the warrant transactions will have a dilutive effect on our earnings per share to the extent that the price of our common stock as measured under the warrant transactions exceeds the strike price of the warrant transactions. The hedge counterparties and their respective affiliates periodically modify their hedge positions from time to time following the pricing of the notes (and are particularly likely to do so during any observation period relating to a conversion of the notes) by entering into or unwinding various over-the-counter derivative transactions with respect to our common stock, or by purchasing or selling shares of our common stock or the notes in privately negotiated transactions or open market transactions. The effect, if any, of these transactions and activities on the market price of our common stock or the trading price of the notes will depend in part on market conditions and cannot be ascertained at this time. Any of these activities, however, could adversely affect the market price of our common stock and the trading price of the notes. We do not make any representation or prediction as to the direction or magnitude of any potential effect that the transactions described above may have on the price of the notes or our common stock. In addition, we do not make any representation that the counterparties to those transactions will engage in these transactions or activities or that these transactions and activities, once commenced, will not be discontinued without notice; the counterparties or their affiliates may choose to engage in, or discontinue engaging in, any of these transactions or activities with or without notice at any time, and their decisions will be in their sole discretion and not within our control. We are subject to counterparty risk with respect to the convertible note hedge transactions. The hedge counterparties are financial institutions or affiliates of financial institutions, and we will be subject to the risk that these hedge counterparties may default under the convertible note hedge transactions. Our exposure to the credit risk of the hedge counterparties will not be secured by any collateral. If one or more of the hedge counterparties to one or more of our convertible note hedge transactions becomes subject to insolvency proceedings, we will become an unsecured creditor in those proceedings with a claim equal to our exposure at the time under those transactions. Our exposure will depend on many factors but, generally, the increase in our exposure will be correlated to the increase in our stock price and the volatility of our stock. In addition, upon a default by one of the hedge counterparties, we may suffer adverse tax consequences and dilution with respect to our common stock. We can provide no assurances as to the financial stability or viability of any of the hedge counterparties. Provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws and Delaware law might discourage, delay or prevent a change of control of our company or changes in our management and, therefore, depress the market price of our common stock. Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that could depress the market price of our common stock by acting to discourage, delay or prevent a change in control of our company or changes in our management that the stockholders of our company may deem advantageous. These provisions among other things: ##TABLE_START  permit the board of directors to establish the number of directors; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  provide that directors may only be removed for cause and only with the approval of holders of 66 2/3 percent of our outstanding capital stock; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  require super-majority voting to amend some provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  authorize the issuance of blank check preferred stock that our board could use to implement a stockholder rights plan (also known as a poison pill); ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  prohibit the ability of our stockholders to call special meetings of stockholders; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  prohibit stockholder action by written consent, which requires all stockholder actions to be taken at a meeting of our stockholders; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  provide that the board of directors is expressly authorized to make, alter or repeal our bylaws; and ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  establish advance notice requirements for nominations for election to our board or for proposing matters that can be acted upon by stockholders at annual stockholder meetings. ##TABLE_END In addition, Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law may discourage, delay or prevent a change in control of our company. Section 203 imposes certain restrictions on merger, business combinations and other transactions between us and holders of 15 percent or more of our common stock. In addition, the fundamental change purchase rights applicable to the notes, which will allow note holders to require us to purchase all or a portion of their notes upon the occurrence of a fundamental change, and the provisions requiring an increase to the conversion rate for conversions in connection with a make-whole fundamental change may in certain circumstances delay or prevent a takeover of us and the removal of incumbent management that might otherwise be beneficial to investors. ", "1B": " ITEM 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS None. ", "2": " ITEM 2. PROPERTIES As of January 31, 2015 , our executive offices and principal offices for domestic marketing, sales, professional services and development consist of over 1.1 million square feet of leased space in the San Francisco Bay Area. We also lease space in various locations throughout the United States for local sales and professional services personnel. Our foreign subsidiaries lease office space for their operations including local sales and professional services personnel. In addition, we have also entered into the following commitments for additional office space in the San Francisco Bay Area. In December 2012 , we entered into a lease agreement for approximately 445,000 rentable square feet of office space at 350 Mission Street in San Francisco, California. The space rented is for the total office space available in the building, which is in the process of being constructed. As a result of our involvement during the construction period, we are considered for accounting purposes to be the owner of the construction project. We do not currently occupy this property and we have excluded the square footage from the total leased space in the San Francisco Bay Area stated above. In April 2014, we entered into an office lease agreement to lease approximately 714,000 rentable square feet of an office building located in San Francisco, California that is under construction. The lease payments associated with the lease will be approximately $560.0 million over the 15.5 year term of the lease, beginning in our first quarter of fiscal 2018. We do not currently occupy this property and we have excluded the square footage from the total leased space in the San Francisco Bay Area stated above. In November 2014 , the Company entered into an agreement to purchase real property of approximately 817,000 rentable square feet known as 50 Fremont Street, San Francisco, California. We currently occupy approximately 500,000 square feet of the total available space in 50 Fremont. The purchase closed in February 2015 (see Note 14 Subsequent Event in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for details). We believe that our existing facilities and offices are adequate to meet our current requirements. If we require additional space, we believe that we will be able to obtain such space on acceptable, commercially reasonable terms. ##TABLE_START ", "3": " ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS ##TABLE_END In the ordinary course of business, we are or may be involved in various legal proceedings and claims related to alleged infringement of third-party patents and other intellectual property rights, commercial, corporate and securities, labor and employment, class actions, wage and hour, and other claims. We have been, and may in the future be, put on notice or sued by third parties for alleged infringement of their proprietary rights, including patent infringement. During fiscal 2015, the Company received a communication from a large technology company alleging that the Company infringed certain of its patents. The Company continues to analyze this claim. No litigation has been filed to date. There can be no assurance that this claim will not lead to litigation in the future. The resolution of this claim is not expected to have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial condition, but it could be material to the net income or cash flows or both of a particular quarter. We evaluate all claims and lawsuits with respect to their potential merits, our potential defenses and counterclaims, settlement or litigation potential and the expected effect on us. Our technologies may be subject to injunction if they are found to infringe the rights of a third party. In addition, many of our subscription agreements require us to indemnify our customers for third-party intellectual property infringement claims, which could increase the cost to us of an adverse ruling on such a claim. The outcome of any claims or litigation, regardless of the merits, is inherently uncertain. Any claims and other lawsuits, and the disposition of such claims and lawsuits, whether through settlement or litigation, could be time-consuming and expensive to resolve, divert our attention from executing our business plan, result in efforts to enjoin our activities, lead to attempts by third parties to seek similar claims and, in the case of intellectual property claims, require us to change our technology, change our business practices, pay monetary damages or enter into short- or long-term royalty or licensing agreements. In general, the resolution of a legal matter could prevent us from offering our service to others, could be material to our financial condition or cash flows, or both, or could otherwise adversely affect our operating results. We make a provision for a liability relating to legal matters when it is both probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. These provisions are reviewed at least quarterly and adjusted to reflect the impacts of negotiations, estimated settlements, legal rulings, advice of legal counsel and other information and events pertaining to a particular matter. In our opinion, resolution of all current matters is not expected to have a material adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations, cash flows or financial position. However, depending on the nature and timing of any such dispute, an unfavorable resolution of a matter could materially affect our future results of operations or cash flows, or both, of a particular quarter. ##TABLE_START ", "4": " ITEM 4.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS ##TABLE_END The following discussion contains forward-looking statements, including, without limitation, our expectations and statements regarding our outlook and future revenues, expenses, results of operations, liquidity, plans, strategies and objectives of management and any assumptions underlying any of the foregoing. Our actual results may differ significantly from those projected in the forward-looking statements. Our forward-looking statements and factors that might cause future actual results to differ materially from our recent results or those projected in the forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, those discussed in the section titled Forward-Looking Information and Risk Factors of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Except as required by law, we assume no obligation to update the forward-looking statements or our risk factors for any reason. Overview We are a leading provider of enterprise cloud computing solutions, with a focus on customer relationship management, or CRM. We introduced our first CRM solution in February 2000 and we have since expanded our offerings with new editions, solutions, enhanced features, platform capabilities and a new analytics solution through internal development and acquisitions. We sell to businesses of all sizes and in almost every industry worldwide on a subscription basis. Our mission is to help our customers transform themselves into customer companies by empowering them to connect with their customers in entirely new ways. With our six core cloud service offeringsSales Cloud, Service Cloud, Marketing Cloud, Communities Cloud, Analytics Cloud and the Salesforce1 Platformcustomers have the tools they need to build a next generation customer success platform. Key elements of our strategy include: ##TABLE_START  strengthening our market-leading solutions; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  extending distribution into new and high-growth categories; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  expanding strategic relationships with our existing customers; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  pursuing new customers; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  reducing attrition; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  building our business in top software markets globally, which includes building partnerships that help add customers; and ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  encouraging the development of third-party applications on our cloud computing platforms. ##TABLE_END We believe the factors that will influence our ability to achieve our objectives include: our prospective customers willingness to migrate to enterprise cloud computing services; the availability, performance and security of our service; our ability to continue to release, and gain customer acceptance of, new and improved features; our ability to successfully integrate acquired businesses and technologies; successful customer adoption and utilization of our service; acceptance of our service in markets where we have few customers; the emergence of additional competitors in our market and improved product offerings by existing and new competitors; the location of new data centers; third-party developers willingness to develop applications on our platforms; our ability to attract new personnel and retain and motivate current personnel; and general economic conditions which could affect our customers ability and willingness to purchase our services, delay the customers purchasing decision or affect attrition rates. To address these factors, we will need to, among other things, continue to add substantial numbers of paying subscriptions, upgrade our customers to fully featured versions or arrangements such as an Enterprise License Agreement, provide high quality technical support to our customers, encourage the development of third-party applications on our platforms and continue to focus on retaining customers at the time of renewal. Our plans to invest for future growth include the continuation of the expansion of our data center capacity, the hiring of additional personnel, particularly in direct sales, other customer-related areas and research and development, the expansion of domestic and international selling and marketing activities, specifically in our top markets, continuing to develop our brands, the addition of distribution channels, the upgrade of our service offerings, the development of new services such as the announcement of our Analytics Cloud and Community Cloud, the integration of acquired technologies, the expansion of our Marketing Cloud and Salesforce1 Platform core service offerings, and the additions to our global infrastructure to support our growth. We also regularly evaluate acquisitions or investment opportunities in complementary businesses, joint ventures, services and technologies and intellectual property rights in an effort to expand our service offerings. We expect to continue to make such investments and acquisitions in the future and we plan to reinvest a significant portion of our incremental revenue in future periods to grow our business and continue our leadership role in the cloud computing industry. As a result of our aggressive growth plans, specifically our hiring plan and acquisition activities, we have incurred significant expenses from equity awards and amortization of purchased intangibles which have resulted in net losses on a U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (\"GAAP\") basis. As we continue with our growth plan, we may continue to have net losses on a GAAP basis. We remained focused on improving operating margins in fiscal 2015 and expect to remain similarly focused in fiscal 2016. Our operating loss for fiscal 2015 was $145.6 million compared to $286.1 million during the same period a year ago. Our typical subscription contract term is 12 to 36 months, although terms range from one to 60 months, so during any fiscal reporting period only a subset of active subscription contracts is eligible for renewal. We calculate our attrition rate as of the end of each month. Our current attrition rate calculation does not include the Marketing Cloud service offerings. Our attrition rate was between nine and ten percent during the fiscal year ended January 31, 2015 , which is consistent with the attrition rate as of January 31, 2014 . We expect our attrition rate to remain in this range as we continue to expand our enterprise business and invest in customer success and related programs. We expect marketing and sales costs, which were 51 percent of our total revenues for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2015 and 53 percent for the same period a year ago, to continue to represent a substantial portion of total revenues in the future as we seek to grow our customer base, sell more products to existing customers, and build greater brand awareness. Fiscal Year Our fiscal year ends on January 31. References to fiscal 2015 , for example, refer to the fiscal year ending January 31, 2015 . Operating Segments We operate as one operating segment. Operating segments are defined as components of an enterprise for which separate financial information is evaluated regularly by the chief operating decision maker, who in our case is the chief executive officer, in deciding how to allocate resources and assess performance. Over the past few years, we have completed several acquisitions. These acquisitions have allowed us to expand our offerings, presence and reach in various market segments of the enterprise cloud computing market. While we have offerings in multiple enterprise cloud computing market segments, our business operates in one operating segment because all of our offerings operate on a single platform and are deployed in an identical way, and  our chief operating decision maker evaluates our financial information and resources and assesses the performance of these resources on a consolidated basis. Since we operate as one operating segment, all required financial segment information can be found in the consolidated financial statements. Sources of Revenues We derive our revenues from two sources: (1) subscription revenues, which are comprised of subscription fees from customers accessing our enterprise cloud computing services and from customers paying for additional support beyond the standard support that is included in the basic subscription fees; and (2) related professional services such as process mapping, project management, implementation services and other revenue. Other revenue consists primarily of training fees. Subscription and support revenues accounted for approximately 93 percent percent of our total revenues for fiscal 2015 . Subscription revenues are driven primarily by the number of paying subscribers, varying service types, the price of our service and renewals. We define a customer as a separate and distinct buying entity (e.g., a company, a distinct business unit of a large corporation, a partnership, etc.) that has entered into a contract to access our enterprise cloud computing services. We define a subscription as a unique user account purchased by a customer for use by its employees or other customer-authorized users, and we refer to each such user as a subscriber. The number of paying subscriptions at each of our customers ranges from one to hundreds of thousands. None of our customers accounted for more than five percent of our revenues during fiscal 2015 , 2014 or 2013 . Subscription and support revenues are recognized ratably over the contract terms beginning on the commencement dates of each contract. The typical subscription and support term is 12 to 36 months, although terms range from one to 60 months. Our subscription and support contracts are non-cancelable, though customers typically have the right to terminate their contracts for cause if we materially fail to perform. We generally invoice our customers in advance, in annual installments, and typical payment terms provide that our customers pay us within 30 days of invoice. Amounts that have been invoiced are recorded in accounts receivable and in deferred revenue, or in revenue depending on whether the revenue recognition criteria have been met. In general, we collect our billings in advance of the subscription service period. Professional services and other revenues consist of fees associated with consulting and implementation services and training. Our consulting and implementation engagements are typically billed on a time and materials basis. We also offer a number of training classes on implementing, using and administering our service that are billed on a per person, per class basis. Our typical professional services payment terms provide that our customers pay us within 30 days of invoice. In determining whether professional services can be accounted for separately from subscription and support revenues, we consider a number of factors, which are described in Critical Accounting EstimatesRevenue Recognition below. Revenue by Cloud Service Offering We are providing the information below on a supplemental basis to give additional insight into the revenue performance of our individual core service offerings. Subscription and support revenues consisted of the following by core service offering (in millions): ##TABLE_START   Fiscal Year Ended January 31, 2015 Sales Cloud  $ 2,443.0 Service Cloud  1,320.2 Salesforce1 Platform and Other  745.3 Marketing Cloud  505.3 Total  $ 5,013.8 ##TABLE_ENDSubscription and support revenues from Analytics Cloud and Communities Cloud were not significant for fiscal 2015. Analytics Cloud revenue is included with Salesforce1 Platform and Other in the table above. Communities Cloud revenue is included in either Sales Cloud, Service Cloud or Salesforce1 Platform and Other revenue depending on the primary service offering purchased. In situations where a customer purchases multiple cloud offerings, such as through an Enterprise License Agreement, we allocate the contract value to each core service offering based on the customers estimated product demand plan and the service that was provided at the inception of the contract. We do not update these allocations based on actual product usage during the term of the contract. We have allocated approximately 10 percent of our total subscription and support revenues for fiscal 2015 , based on customers estimated product demand plans and these allocated amounts are included in the table above. Additionally, some of our core service offerings have similar features and functions. For example, customers may use the Sales Cloud, the Service Cloud or our Salesforce1 Platform to record account and contact information, which are similar features across these core service offerings. Depending on a customers actual and projected business requirements, more than one core service offering may satisfy the customers current and future needs. We record revenue based on the individual products ordered by a customer, and not according to the customers business requirements and usage. In addition, as we introduce new features and functions within each offering, and refine our allocation methodology for changes in our business, we do not expect it to be practical to adjust historical revenue results by core service offering for comparability. Accordingly, comparisons of revenue performance by core service offering over time may not be meaningful. Our Sales Cloud service offering is our most widely distributed service offering and has historically been the largest contributor of subscription and support revenues. As a result, Sales Cloud has the most international exposure and foreign exchange rate exposure, relative to the other cloud service offerings. Conversely, revenue for Marketing Cloud is primarily derived from the Americas, with little impact from foreign exchange rate movement. We estimate that for fiscal 2016 , subscription and support revenues from the Sales Cloud service offering will continue to be the largest contributor of subscription and support revenue, and foreign currency will continue to have a more pronounced impact on Sales Cloud subscription and support revenues than revenues from our other cloud service offerings. Seasonal Nature of Deferred Revenue, Accounts Receivable and Operating Cash Flow Deferred revenue primarily consists of billings to customers for our subscription service. Over 90 percent of the value of our billings to customers is for our subscription and support service. We generally invoice our customers in annual cycles. Approximately 80 percent of all subscription and support invoices were issued with annual terms during fiscal 2015 in comparison to nearly 74 percent during fiscal 2014. Occasionally, we bill customers for their multi-year contract on a single invoice which results in an increase in noncurrent deferred revenue. We typically issue renewal invoices in advance of the renewal service period, and depending on timing, the initial invoice for the subscription and services contract and the subsequent renewal invoice may occur in different quarters. This may result in an increase in deferred revenue and accounts receivable. There is a disproportionate weighting towards annual billings in the fourth quarter, primarily as a result of large enterprise account buying patterns. Our fourth quarter has historically been our strongest quarter for new business and renewals. The year on year compounding effect of this seasonality in both billing patterns and overall new and renewal business causes the value of invoices that we generate in the fourth quarter for both new business and renewals to increase as a proportion of our total annual billings. Accordingly, because of this billing activity, our first quarter is historically our largest collections and operating cash flow quarter. The sequential quarterly changes in accounts receivable, related deferred revenue and operating cash flow during the first three quarters of our fiscal year are not necessarily indicative of the billing activity that occurs in the fourth quarter as displayed below (in thousands, except unbilled deferred revenue):  ##TABLE_START  April 30, 2014  July 31, 2014  October 31, 2014  January 31, 2015 Fiscal 2015        Accounts receivable, net $ 684,155  $ 834,323  $ 794,590  $ 1,905,506 Deferred revenue, current and noncurrent 2,324,615  2,352,904  2,223,977  3,321,449 Operating cash flow (1) 473,087  245,893  122,511  332,223 Unbilled deferred revenue, a non-GAAP measure 4.8 bn  5.0 bn  5.4 bn  5.7 bn ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  April 30,  July 31,  October 31,  January 31, Fiscal 2014        Accounts receivable, net $ 502,609  $ 599,543  $ 604,045  $ 1,360,837 Deferred revenue, current and noncurrent 1,733,160  1,789,648  1,734,619  2,522,115 Operating cash flow (1) 283,189  183,183  137,859  271,238 Unbilled deferred revenue, a non-GAAP measure 3.6 bn  3.8 bn  4.2 bn  4.5 bn ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  April 30,  July 31,  October 31,  January 31, Fiscal 2013        Accounts receivable, net $ 371,395  $ 446,917  $ 418,590  $ 872,634 Deferred revenue, current and noncurrent 1,334,716  1,337,184  1,291,703  1,862,995 Operating cash flow (1) 213,212  136,197  105,915  281,573 Unbilled deferred revenue, a non-GAAP measure 2.7 bn  2.8 bn  3.0 bn  3.5 bn ##TABLE_END(1) Operating cash flow represents net cash provided by operating activities for the three months ended in the periods stated above.  Unbilled Deferred Revenue, a Non-GAAP Measure The deferred revenue balance on our consolidated balance sheet does not represent the total contract value of annual or multi-year, non-cancelable subscription agreements. Unbilled deferred revenue represents future billings under our subscription agreements that have not been invoiced and, accordingly, are not recorded in deferred revenue. Unbilled deferred revenue was approximately $5.7 billion as of January 31, 2015 and approximately $4.5 billion as of January 31, 2014 . Our typical contract length is between 12 and 36 months. We expect that the amount of unbilled deferred revenue will change from quarter to quarter for several reasons, including the specific timing, duration and size of large customer subscription agreements, varying billing cycles of subscription agreements, the specific timing of customer renewals, foreign currency fluctuations, the timing of when unbilled deferred revenue is to be recognized as revenue, and changes in customer financial circumstances. For multi-year subscription agreements billed annually, the associated unbilled deferred revenue is typically high at the beginning of the contract period, zero just prior to renewal, and increases if the agreement is renewed. Low unbilled deferred revenue attributable to a particular subscription agreement is often associated with an impending renewal and may not be an indicator of the likelihood of renewal or future revenue from such customer. Accordingly, we expect that the amount of aggregate unbilled deferred revenue will change from year-to-year depending in part upon the number and dollar amount of subscription agreements at particular stages in their renewal cycle. Such fluctuations are not a reliable indicator of future revenues. Unbilled deferred revenue does not include minimum revenue commitments from indirect sales channels, as we recognize revenue, deferred revenue, and any unbilled deferred revenue upon sell-through to an end user customer. Cost of Revenues and Operating Expenses Cost of Revenues. Cost of subscription and support revenues primarily consists of expenses related to hosting our service and providing support, the costs of data center capacity, depreciation or operating lease expense associated with computer equipment and software, allocated overhead, amortization expense associated with capitalized software related to our services and acquired developed technologies and certain fees paid to various third parties for the use of their technology, services and data. We allocate overhead such as information technology infrastructure, rent and occupancy charges based on headcount. Employee benefit costs and taxes are allocated based upon a percentage of total compensation expense. As such, general overhead expenses are reflected in each cost of revenue and operating expense category. Cost of professional services and other revenues consists primarily of employee-related costs associated with these services, including stock-based expenses, the cost of subcontractors and allocated overhead. The cost of providing professional services is significantly higher as a percentage of the related revenue than for our enterprise cloud computing subscription service due to the direct labor costs and costs of subcontractors. We intend to continue to invest additional resources in our enterprise cloud computing services. For example, we have invested in additional database software and we plan to open additional data centers and expand our current data center capacity in the future. As we acquire new businesses and technologies, the amortization expense associated with this activity will be included in cost of revenues. Additionally, as we enter into new contracts with third parties for the use of their technology, services or data, or as our sales volume grows, the fees paid to use such technology or services may increase. The timing of these additional expenses will affect our cost of revenues, both in terms of absolute dollars and as a percentage of revenues, in the affected periods. Research and Development . Research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries and related expenses, including stock-based expenses, the costs of our development and test data center and allocated overhead. We continue to focus our research and development efforts on adding new features and services, integrating acquired technologies, increasing the functionality and security and enhancing the ease of use of our enterprise cloud computing services. Our proprietary, scalable and secure multi-tenant architecture enables us to provide all of our customers with a service based on a single version of our application. As a result, we do not have to maintain multiple versions, which enables us to have relatively lower research and development expenses as compared to traditional enterprise software companies. We expect that in the future, research and development expenses will increase in absolute dollars and may increase as a percentage of total revenues as we invest in building the necessary employee and system infrastructure required to support the development of new, and improve existing, technologies and the integration of acquired businesses and technologies. Marketing and Sales. Marketing and sales expenses are our largest cost and consist primarily of salaries and related expenses, including stock-based expenses, for our sales and marketing staff, including commissions, payments to partners, marketing programs and allocated overhead. Marketing programs consist of advertising, events, corporate communications, brand building and product marketing activities. We plan to continue to invest in marketing and sales by expanding our domestic and international selling and marketing activities, building brand awareness, attracting new customers and sponsoring additional marketing events. The timing of these marketing events, such as our annual and largest event, Dreamforce, will affect our marketing costs in a particular quarter. We expect that in the future, marketing and sales expenses will increase in absolute dollars and continue to be our largest cost. General and Administrative. General and administrative expenses consist of salaries and related expenses, including stock-based expenses, for finance and accounting, legal, internal audit, human resources and management information systems personnel, legal costs, professional fees, other corporate expenses and allocated overhead. We expect that in the future, general and administrative expenses will increase in absolute dollars as we invest in our infrastructure and we incur additional employee related costs, professional fees and insurance costs related to the growth of our business and international expansion. We expect general and administrative costs as a percentage of total revenues to either remain flat or decrease for the next several quarters. Stock-Based Expenses. Our cost of revenues and operating expenses include stock-based expenses related to equity plans for employees and non-employee directors. We recognize our stock-based compensation as an expense in the statement of operations based on their fair values and vesting periods. These charges have been significant in the past and we expect that they will increase as our stock price increases, as we acquire more companies, as we hire more employees and seek to retain existing employees. During fiscal 2015 , we recognized stock-based expense of $564.8 million . As of January 31, 2015 , the aggregate stock compensation remaining to be amortized to costs and expenses over a weighted-average period of 2.0 years was $1.4 billion . We expect this stock compensation balance to be amortized as follows: $556.6 million during fiscal 2016 ; $411.6 million during fiscal 2017 ; $288.9 million during fiscal 2018 ; $127.4 million during fiscal 2019 and $0.5 million during fiscal 2020 . The expected amortization reflects only outstanding stock awards as of January 31, 2015 and assumes no forfeiture activity. We expect to continue to issue stock-based awards to our employees in future periods. Amortization of Purchased Intangibles from Business Combinations . Our cost of revenues and operating expenses include amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets, such as the amortization of the cost associated with an acquired companys research and development efforts, trade names, customer lists and customer relationships. We expect this expense to increase as we acquire more companies. Critical Accounting Estimates Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, costs and expenses, and related disclosures. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates and assumptions. Our actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. We believe that of our significant accounting policies, which are described in Note 1 Summary of Business and Significant Accounting Policies to our consolidated financial statements, the following accounting policies involve a greater degree of judgment and complexity. Accordingly, these are the policies we believe are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our consolidated financial condition and results of operations. Revenue Recognition . We derive our revenues from two sources: (1) subscription revenues, which are comprised of subscription fees from customers accessing our enterprise cloud computing services and from customers purchasing additional support beyond the standard support that is included in the basic subscription fee; and (2) related professional services such as process mapping, project management, implementation services and other revenue. Other revenue consists primarily of training fees. We commence revenue recognition when all of the following conditions are satisfied: ##TABLE_START  there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  the service has been or is being provided to the customer; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  the collection of the fees is reasonably assured; and ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  the amount of fees to be paid by the customer is fixed or determinable. ##TABLE_END Our subscription service arrangements are non-cancelable and do not contain refund-type provisions. Subscription and Support Revenues Subscription and support revenues are recognized ratably over the contract terms beginning on the commencement date of each contract, which is the date our service is made available to customers. Amounts that have been invoiced are recorded in accounts receivable and in deferred revenue or revenue, depending on whether the revenue recognition criteria have been met. Professional Services and Other Revenues The majority of our professional services contracts are on a time and material basis. When these services are not combined with subscription revenues as a single unit of accounting, as discussed below, these revenues are recognized as the services are rendered for time and material contracts, and when the milestones are achieved and accepted by the customer for fixed price contracts. Training revenues are recognized after the services are performed. Multiple Deliverable Arrangements We enter into arrangements with multiple deliverables that generally include multiple subscriptions, premium support, and professional services. If the deliverables have standalone value upon delivery, we account for each deliverable separately. Subscription services have standalone value as such services are often sold separately. In determining whether professional services have standalone value, we consider the following factors for each professional services agreement: availability of the services from other vendors, the nature of the professional services, the timing of when the professional services contract was signed in comparison to the subscription service start date, and the contractual dependence of the subscription service on the customers satisfaction with the professional services work. To date, we have concluded that all of the professional services included in multiple deliverable arrangements executed have standalone value. Multiple deliverables included in an arrangement are separated into different units of accounting and the arrangement consideration is allocated to the identified separate units based on a relative selling price hierarchy. We determine the relative selling price for a deliverable based on its vendor-specific objective evidence of selling price (VSOE), if available, or our best estimate of selling price (BESP), if VSOE is not available. We have determined that third-party evidence (TPE) is not a practical alternative due to differences in our service offerings compared to other parties and the availability of relevant third-party pricing information. The amount of revenue allocated to delivered items is limited by contingent revenue, if any. For certain professional services, we have established VSOE as a consistent number of standalone sales of this deliverable have been priced within a reasonably narrow range. We have not established VSOE for our subscription services due to lack of pricing consistency, the introduction of new services and other factors. Accordingly, we use our BESP to determine the relative selling price. We determined BESP by considering our overall pricing objectives and market conditions. Significant pricing practices taken into consideration include our discounting practices, the size and volume of our transactions, the customer demographic, the geographic area where our services are sold, our price lists, our go-to-market strategy, historical standalone sales and contract prices. The determination of BESP is made through consultation with and approval by management, taking into consideration the go-to-market strategy. As our go-to-market strategies evolve, we may modify our pricing practices in the future, which could result in changes in relative selling prices, including both VSOE and BESP. Deferred Revenue. The deferred revenue balance does not represent the total contract value of annual or multi-year, non-cancelable subscription agreements. Deferred revenue primarily consists of billings or payments received in advance of revenue recognition from subscription service described above and is recognized as the revenue recognition criteria are met. We generally invoice customers in annual installments. The deferred revenue balance is influenced by several factors, including seasonality, the compounding effects of renewals, invoice duration, invoice timing, size and new business linearity within the quarter. Deferred revenue that will be recognized during the succeeding twelve month period is recorded as current deferred revenue and the remaining portion is recorded as noncurrent. Deferred Commissions. We defer commission payments to our direct sales force. The commissions are deferred and amortized to sales expense over the non-cancelable terms of the related subscription contracts with our customers, which are typically 12 to 36 months. The commission payments, which are paid in full the month after the customers service commences, are a direct and incremental cost of the revenue arrangements. The deferred commission amounts are recoverable through the future revenue streams under the non-cancelable customer contracts. We believe this is the preferable method of accounting as the commission charges are so closely related to the revenue from the non-cancelable customer contracts that they should be recorded as an asset and charged to expense over the same period that the subscription revenue is recognized. During the fiscal 2015 , we deferred $320.9 million of commission expenditures and we amortized $257.6 million to sales expense. During the same period a year ago, we deferred $265.1 million of commission expenditures and we amortized $194.6 million to sales expense. Deferred commissions on our consolidated balance sheets totaled $388.2 million at January 31, 2015 and $324.9 million at January 31, 2014 . Capitalized Internal-Use Software Costs . We are required to follow the guidance of Accounting Standards Codification 350 (ASC 350), Intangibles- Goodwill and Other in accounting for the cost of computer software developed for internal-use and the accounting for web-based product development costs. ASC 350 requires companies to capitalize qualifying computer software costs, which are incurred during the application development stage, and amortize these costs on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the respective asset. We deliver our enterprise cloud computing solutions as a service via all the major Internet browsers and on leading major mobile device operating systems. As a result of this software as a service delivery model, we believe we have larger capitalized costs as compared to traditional enterprise software companies as they are required to use a different accounting standard. Costs related to preliminary project activities and post implementation activities are expensed as incurred. Internal-use software is amortized on a straight-line basis over its estimated useful life. We evaluate the useful lives of these assets on an annual basis and test for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances occur that could impact the recoverability of these assets. Goodwill and Long-Lived Assets . We make estimates, assumptions, and judgments when valuing goodwill and other intangible assets in connection with the initial purchase price allocation of an acquired entity, as well as when evaluating the recoverability of our goodwill and other intangible assets on an ongoing basis. These estimates are based upon a number of factors, including historical experience, market conditions, and information obtained from the management of acquired companies. Critical estimates in valuing certain intangible assets include, but are not limited to, historical and projected attrition rates, anticipated growth in revenue from the acquired customers and acquired technology, and the expected use of the acquired assets. These factors are also considered in determining the useful life of acquired intangible assets. The amounts and useful lives assigned to identified intangible assets impacts the amount and timing of future amortization expense. The value of our goodwill and intangible assets could be impacted by future adverse changes such as, but not limited to: a substantial decline in our market capitalization; an adverse action or assessment by a regulator; and unanticipated competition. We evaluate and test the recoverability of our goodwill for impairment at least annually during the fourth quarter or more often if and when circumstances indicate that goodwill may not be recoverable. Each period we evaluate the estimated remaining useful life of our intangible assets and whether events or changes in circumstances warrant a revision to the remaining period of amortization. We evaluate long-lived assets, such as property and equipment, and purchased intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable. Such events or changes in circumstances include, but are not limited to, a significant decrease in the fair value of the underlying asset, a significant decrease in the benefits realized from the acquired assets, difficulty and delays in integrating the business or a significant change in the operations of the acquired assets or use of an asset. A long-lived asset is considered impaired if its carrying amount exceeds the estimated future undiscounted cash flows the asset is expected to generate. If a long-lived asset is considered to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized is the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset or asset group. Business Combinations. Accounting for business combinations requires us to make significant estimates and assumptions, especially at the acquisition date with respect to tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed and pre-acquisition contingencies. We use our best estimates and assumptions to accurately assign fair value to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date. Examples of critical estimates in valuing certain of the intangible assets and goodwill we have acquired include but are not limited to: ##TABLE_START  future expected cash flows from subscription and support contracts, professional services contracts, other customer contracts and acquired developed technologies and patents; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  the acquired companys trade name, trademark and existing customer relationship, as well as assumptions about the period of time the acquired trade name and trademark will continue to be used in our offerings; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  uncertain tax positions and tax related valuation allowances assumed; and ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  discount rates. ##TABLE_END 37 Unanticipated events and circumstances may occur that may affect the accuracy or validity of such assumptions, estimates or actual results. Stock-Based Options and Awards. We recognize the fair value of our stock options and awards on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period of the option or award which is the vesting term of generally four years for stock options and restricted stock awards and one year for shares issued pursuant to our Employee Stock Purchase Plan (ESPP). The fair value of each option or ESPP share or stock purchase right is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. The estimated forfeiture rate applied is based on historical forfeiture rates. We evaluate the forfeiture rates at least annually, or when events or circumstances indicate a change may be needed. This may cause a fluctuation in our stock-based expense in the period of change. Inputs into the Black-Scholes option pricing model include: ##TABLE_START  The estimated life for the stock options which is estimated based on an actual analysis of expected life. The estimated life for shares issued pursuant to our ESPP is based on the two purchase periods within the 12 month offering period; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  The risk free interest rate which is based on the rate for a U.S. government security with the same estimated life at the time of the option grant and the stock purchase rights; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  The future stock price volatility which is estimated considering both our observed option-implied volatilities and our historical volatility calculations. We believe this is the best estimate of the expected volatility over the expected life of our stock options and stock purchase rights; and ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  The probability of performance conditions, if any, that affect the vesting of certain awards being achieved. Expense is only recognized for those shares expected to vest. ##TABLE_END Income Taxes. We use the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on temporary differences between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in the consolidated statements of operations in the period that includes the enactment date. At each of the interim financial reporting periods, we compute our tax provision by applying an estimated annual effective tax rate to year to date ordinary income and adjust the provision for discrete tax items recorded in the same period. The estimated annual effective tax rate at each interim period represents the best estimate based on evaluations of possible future transactions and may be subject to subsequent refinement or revision. Our tax positions are subject to income tax audits by multiple tax jurisdictions throughout the world. We recognize the tax benefit of an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the position is sustainable upon examination by the taxing authority, based on the technical merits. The tax benefit recognized is measured as the largest amount of benefit which is greater than 50 percent likely to be realized upon settlement with the taxing authority. We recognize interest accrued and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in our income tax provision. Valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amounts that are more likely than not expected to be realized based on the weighting of positive and negative evidence. Future realization of deferred tax assets ultimately depends on the existence of sufficient taxable income of the appropriate character (for example, ordinary income or capital gain) within the carryback or carryforward periods available under the applicable tax law. We regularly review the deferred tax assets for recoverability based on historical taxable income, projected future taxable income, the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences and tax planning strategies. Our judgment regarding future profitability may change due to many factors, including future market conditions and the ability to successfully execute the business plans and/or tax planning strategies. Should there be a change in the ability to recover deferred tax assets, our income tax provision would increase or decrease in the period in which the assessment is changed. Strategic Investments . We report our investments in non-marketable equity and debt securities, which consist of minority equity and debt investments in privately-held companies, at cost or fair value when an event or circumstance indicates an other-than-temporary decline in value has occurred. Management evaluates financial results, earnings trends, technology milestones and subsequent financing of these companies, as well as the general market conditions to identify indicators of other-than-temporary impairment. In determining the estimated fair value of our strategic investments in privately-held companies, we utilize the most recent data available to us. Valuations of privately-held companies are inherently complex due to the lack of readily available data.

Unbilled deferred revenue represents future billings under our non-cancelable subscription agreements that have not been invoiced and, accordingly, are not recorded in deferred revenue. Fiscal Years Ended January 31, 2015 and 2014  Revenues. ##TABLE_START  Fiscal Year Ended January 31,  Variance (in thousands)   Dollars  Percent Subscription and support $ 5,013,764  $ 3,824,542  $ 1,189,222  31% Professional services and other 359,822  246,461  113,361  46% Total revenues $ 5,373,586  $ 4,071,003  $ 1,302,583  32% ##TABLE_ENDTotal revenues were $5.4 billion for fiscal 2015 , compared to $4.1 billion during the same period a year ago, an increase of $1.3 billion , or 32 percent . On a constant currency basis, total revenues grew 33 percent. Subscription and support revenues were $5.0 billion , or 93 percent of total revenues, for fiscal 2015 , compared to $3.8 billion , or 94 percent of total revenues, during the same period a year ago, an increase of $1.2 billion , or 31 percent . The increase in subscription and support revenues was primarily attributable to the impact of, in fiscal 2015 , including ExactTarget revenue for the full fiscal year, as compared to fiscal 2014 , which only included ExactTarget revenue as of its acquisition date in July 2013 . Additionally, volume-driven increases from new business, which includes new customers, upgrades and additional subscriptions from existing customers contributed to the increase in subscription and support revenues. Our attrition rate, which is consistent with the prior year, also played a role in the increase in subscription and support revenues. We continue to invest in a variety of customer programs and initiatives, which, along with increasing enterprise adoption, have helped maintain our attrition rate. The net price per user per month for our three primary offerings, Professional Edition, Enterprise Edition and Unlimited Edition, varies from period to period, but has remained within a consistent range over the past eight quarters. Changes in the net price per user per month has not been a significant driver of revenue growth for the periods presented. Professional services and other revenues were $359.8 million , or seven percent of total revenues, for fiscal 2015 , compared to $246.5 million , or six percent of total revenues, for the same period a year ago, an increase of $113.4 million , or 46 percent . The increase in professional services and other revenues was primarily attributable to the impact of, in fiscal 2015 , including ExactTarget revenue for the full fiscal year, as compared to fiscal 2014 , which only included ExactTarget revenue as of its acquisition date in July 2013 . Revenues in Europe and Asia Pacific accounted for $1,505.3 million , or 28 percent of total revenues, for fiscal 2015 , compared to $1,171.2 million , or 29 percent of total revenues, during the same period a year ago, an increase of $334.1 million , or 29 percent . The increase in revenues on a total dollar basis outside of the Americas was the result of the increasing acceptance of our service, our focus on marketing our services internationally, additional resources and consistent attrition rates as a result of the reasons stated above. Revenues outside of the Americas increased on a total dollar basis in fiscal 2015 despite an overall strengthening of the U.S. dollar, which reduced aggregate international revenues by $31.5 million compared to the same period a year ago. We expect revenues outside of the Americas to continue to be negatively impacted in fiscal 2016 by the strengthening of the U.S. dollar relative to the Euro, Japanese yen, Australian dollar and British pound. Cost of Revenues.  ##TABLE_START   Fiscal Year Ended January 31,  Variance Dollars (in thousands)    Subscription and support  $ 924,638  $ 711,880  $ 212,758 Professional services and other  364,632  256,548  108,084 Total cost of revenues  $ 1,289,270  $ 968,428  $ 320,842 Percent of total revenues  %  %   ##TABLE_ENDCost of revenues was $1,289.3 million , or 24 percent of total revenues, for fiscal 2015 , compared to $968.4 million , or 24 percent of total revenues, during the same period a year ago, an increase of $320.8 million . The increase in absolute dollars was primarily due to an increase of $122.3 million in employee-related costs, an increase of $8.2 million in stock-based expenses, an increase of $100.6 million in service delivery costs, primarily due to our efforts to increase data center capacity, an increase of $29.9 million in professional and outside services, an increase of $18.8 million in allocated overhead and an increase of $44.7 million in depreciation of property and equipment, offset by a decrease of $19.1 million in amortization of purchased intangibles. We have increased our headcount by 30 percent since January 31, 2014 to meet the higher demand for services from our customers. We intend to continue to invest additional resources in our enterprise cloud computing services and data center capacity. Additionally, the amortization of purchased intangible assets may increase as we acquire additional businesses and technologies. We also plan to add additional employees in our professional services group to facilitate the adoption of our services. The timing of these expenses will affect our cost of revenues, both in terms of absolute dollars and as a percentage of revenues in future periods. The cost of professional services and other revenues exceeded the related revenue during fiscal 2015 by $4.8 million as compared to $10.1 million during the same period a year ago, primarily due to the impact of including ExactTarget revenue for the full fiscal 2015 , as described above, offset by an increase in the cost related to professional services headcount. We expect the cost of professional services to continue to exceed revenue from professional services in future fiscal years. We believe that this investment in professional services facilitates the adoption of our service offerings. Research and Development.  ##TABLE_START   Fiscal Year Ended January 31,  Variance Dollars (in thousands)    Research and development  $ 792,917  $ 623,798  $ 169,119 Percent of total revenues  %  %   ##TABLE_ENDResearch and development expenses were $792.9 million , or 15 percent of total revenues, for fiscal 2015 , compared to $623.8 million , or 15 percent of total revenues, during the same period a year ago, an increase of $169.1 million . The increase in absolute dollars was primarily due to an increase of $132.3 million in employee-related costs, an increase of of $13.8 million in stock-based expense, an increase of $14.8 million in development and test data center expense, and an increase in allocated overhead. We increased our research and development headcount by 25 percent since January 31, 2014 in order to improve and extend our service offerings and develop new technologies. We expect that research and development expenses will increase in absolute dollars and may increase as a percentage of revenues in future periods as we continue to add employees and invest in technology to support the development of new, and improve existing, technologies and the integration of acquired technologies. Marketing and Sales. ##TABLE_START   Fiscal Year Ended January 31,  Variance Dollars (in thousands)    Marketing and sales  $ 2,757,096  $ 2,168,132  $ 588,964 Percent of total revenues  %  %   ##TABLE_ENDMarketing and sales expenses were $2.8 billion , or 51 percent of total revenues, for fiscal 2015 , compared to $2.2 billion , or 53 percent of total revenues, during the same period a year ago, an increase of $589.0 million . The increase in absolute dollars was primarily due to increases of $439.0 million in employee-related costs, including amortization of deferred commissions, $56.4 million in advertising expenses and event costs, $27.8 million stock-based expense, $5.2 million in professional and outside services and $28.0 million in allocated overhead. Our marketing and sales headcount increased by 22 percent since January 31, 2014 . The increase in headcount was primarily attributable to hiring additional sales personnel to focus on adding new customers and increasing penetration within our existing customer base. General and Administrative. ##TABLE_START   Fiscal Year Ended January 31,  Variance Dollars (in thousands)    General and administrative  $ 679,936  $ 596,719  $ 83,217 Percent of total revenues  %  %   ##TABLE_ENDGeneral and administrative expenses were $679.9 million , or 13 percent of total revenues, for fiscal 2015 , compared to $596.7 million , or 15 percent of total revenues, during the same period a year ago, a increase of $83.2 million . The increase was primarily due to an increase of $53.1 million in employee-related costs, an increase of $18.9 million in equipment costs and an increase of $11.7 million in stock-based expense, offset by a decrease of $3.0 million in professional and outside services. Our general and administrative headcount increased by 9 percent since January 31, 2014 as we added personnel to support our growth. Loss from operations. ##TABLE_START   Fiscal Year Ended January 31,  Variance Dollars (in thousands)    Loss from operations  $ (145,633 )  $ (286,074 )  $ 140,441 Percent of total revenues  (3 )%  (7 )%   ##TABLE_ENDLoss from operations for fiscal 2015 was $145.6 million and included $564.8 million of stock-based expenses and $155.0 million of amortization of purchased intangibles. During the same period a year ago, loss from operations was $286.1 million and included $503.3 million of stock-based expenses and $146.5 million of amortization of purchased intangibles. Investment income. ##TABLE_START   Fiscal Year Ended January 31,  Variance Dollars (in thousands)    Investment income  $ 10,038  $ 10,218  $ (180 ) ##TABLE_ENDInvestment income consists of income on our cash and marketable securities balances. Investment income was $10.0 million for fiscal 2015 and was $10.2 million during the same period a year ago. Interest expense. ##TABLE_START   Fiscal Year Ended January 31,  Variance Dollars (in thousands)    Interest expense  $ (73,237 )  $ (77,211 )  $ 3,974 Percent of total revenues  (1 )%  (2 )%   ##TABLE_ENDInterest expense consists of interest on our convertible senior notes, capital leases, term loan and revolving credit facility. Interest expense, net of interest costs capitalized, was $73.2 million for fiscal 2015 and was $77.2 million during the same period a year ago. The decrease was primarily due to the reduced principal balance on our 0.75% convertible senior notes as a result of early note conversions during fiscal 2015. These notes fully matured on January 15, 2015. Gain on sales of land and building improvements During fiscal 2015 , we sold two separate portions of our undeveloped real estate, including a portion of our perpetual parking rights, in San Francisco, California. We recognized a gain of $15.6 million during fiscal 2015 , net of closing costs, as a result of this activity. Other expense. ##TABLE_START   Fiscal Year Ended January 31,  Variance Dollars (in thousands)    Other expense  $ (19,878 )  $ (4,868 )  $ (15,010 ) ##TABLE_ENDOther expense primarily consists of non-operating costs such as foreign currency transaction gains and losses, costs associated with real estate transactions and losses on derecognition of debt. The increase in other expense for fiscal 2015 was primarily due to losses totaling $ 10.3 million related to the extinguishment of the 0.75% Senior Notes converted by noteholders. Benefit from (provision for) income taxes. ##TABLE_START   Fiscal Year Ended January 31,  Variance Dollars (in thousands)    Benefit from (provision for) income taxes  $ (49,603 )  $ 125,760  $ (175,363 ) Effective tax rate  (23)%  %   ##TABLE_ENDWe reported a tax provision of $49.6 million on a pretax loss of $213.1 million , which resulted in a negative effective tax rate of 23 percent for the fiscal 2015 . We had a tax provision primarily due to income taxes in profitable jurisdictions outside the U.S., which was partially offset by tax benefits from current year losses incurred by ExactTarget in certain state jurisdictions. We recorded a tax benefit of $125.8 million with a pretax loss of $357.9 million , which resulted in an effective tax rate of 35 percent for fiscal 2014 . Due to the ExactTarget acquisition, a deferred tax liability was established for the book-tax basis difference related to purchased intangibles. The net deferred tax liability from acquisitions provided an additional source of income to support the realizability of our pre-existing deferred tax assets. As a result, we released a portion of the valuation allowance that was established in fiscal 2013 and recorded a tax benefit of $143.1 million for fiscal 2014. We had a valuation allowance against our U.S. deferred tax assets as we considered our cumulative loss in recent years as a significant piece of negative evidence. We regularly assess the need for a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets by considering both positive and negative evidence related to the likelihood of the realization of the deferred tax assets to determine if it is more-likely-than-not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will be realized. Due to the valuation allowance, the effective tax rate could be volatile and is therefore difficult to forecast in future periods.

Subscription and support revenues were $3.8 billion, or 94 percent of total revenues, for fiscal 2014 , compared to $2.9 billion, or 94 percent of total revenues, during fiscal 2013 , an increase of $955.7 million, or 33 percent. The increase in subscription and support revenues was due almost entirely to volume-driven increases from new customers, upgrades and additional subscriptions from existing customers and a decline in attrition rates as compared to fiscal 2013 . We have continued to invest in a variety of customer programs and initiatives, which, along with longer contract durations and increasing enterprise adoption, have helped reduce our attrition rates. The net price per user per month for our three primary offerings, Professional Edition, Enterprise Edition and Unlimited Edition, varies from period to period, but has remained within a consistent range. The net price per user per month has not been a significant driver of revenue growth for the periods presented. Professional services and other revenues were $246.5 million, or six percent of total revenues, for fiscal 2014, compared to $181.4 million, or six percent of total revenues, for fiscal 2013 , an increase of $65.1 million, or 36 percent. The increase in professional services and other revenues was due primarily to the higher demand for services from an increased number of customers. Revenues in Europe and Asia Pacific accounted for $1,171.2 million, or 29 percent of total revenues, for fiscal 2014, compared to $926.5 million, or 30 percent of total revenues, during fiscal 2013 , an increase of $244.7 million, or 26 percent. The increase in revenues outside of the Americas on a total dollar basis was the result of the increasing acceptance of our service, our focus on marketing our service internationally and reduced attrition rates. Revenues outside of the Americas increased on a total dollar basis in fiscal 2014 despite an overall strengthening of the U.S. dollar, which reduced aggregate international revenues by $24.4 million compared to fiscal 2013.

The increase in absolute dollars was primarily due to an increase of $102.8 million in employee-related costs, an increase of $48.9 million in service delivery costs, primarily due to our efforts in increasing data center capacity, an increase of $80.4 million in depreciation and amortization expenses, $32.1 million of which related to the amortization of acquired developed technology, an increase of $16.1 million in subcontractor and professional services expense, an increase of $23.1 million in allocated overhead and an increase of $11.9 million in stock-based expenses. We increased our customer support and professional services headcount by 58 percent since January 31, 2013 to meet the higher demand for services from our customers, of which the majority was due to the acquisition of ExactTarget. In June 2013, we entered into a large capital lease agreement for software for a period of nine years, which consists of the contractual term of six years and a renewal option of three years.

Benefit from (provision for) Income Taxes. ##TABLE_START   Fiscal Year Ended January 31,  Variance Dollars (in thousands)    Benefit from (provision for) income taxes  $ 125,760  $ (142,651 )  $ 268,411 Effective tax rate  %  (112 )%   ##TABLE_ENDWe reported a tax benefit of $125.8 million with a pretax loss of $357.9 million, which resulted in an effective tax rate of 35 percent for fiscal 2014. Due to the ExactTarget acquisition, a deferred tax liability was established for the book-tax basis difference related to purchased intangibles. The net deferred tax liability from acquisitions provided an additional source of income to support the realizability of our pre-existing deferred tax assets and as a result, we released a portion of the valuation allowance that was established in fiscal 2013 and recorded a tax benefit of $143.1 million for fiscal 2014. We recorded a tax provision of $142.7 million on a pretax loss of $127.8 million, which resulted in a negative effective tax rate of 112 percent for fiscal 2013. Our effective tax rate substantially differed from the federal statutory tax rate of 35 percent primarily due to the tax charge of $186.8 million to establish a valuation allowance for a significant portion of our deferred tax assets. We regularly assess the need for a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets by considering both positive and negative evidence related to the likelihood of the realization of the deferred tax assets to determine if it is more-likely-than-not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will be realized. In our evaluation, we considered our cumulative loss in recent years and our forecasted future losses as significant pieces of negative evidence. During fiscal 2013, we determined that the negative evidence outweighed the positive evidence and a valuation allowance for a significant portion of our deferred tax assets was established that resulted in a tax expense of $186.8 million. Liquidity and Capital Resources At January 31, 2015 , our principal sources of liquidity were cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaling $1.9 billion , which excludes restricted cash of $115.0 million , and accounts receivable of $1.9 billion . Net cash provided by operating activities was $1.2 billion during fiscal 2015 and $875.5 million during the same period a year ago. Cash provided by operating activities has historically been affected by the amount of net loss adjusted for non-cash expense items such as depreciation and amortization, amortization of purchased intangibles from business combinations, amortization of debt discount, and the expense associated with stock-based awards; the reclassification of excess tax benefits from employee stock plans to cash flows from financing activities; the timing of employee related costs including commissions and bonus payments; the timing of collections from our customers, which is our largest source of operating cash flows; and changes in working capital accounts. Our working capital accounts consist of accounts receivables and prepaid assets and other current assets. Claims against working capital include accounts payable, accrued expenses and other current liabilities and our convertible notes. Our working capital may be impacted by factors in future periods, certain amounts and timing of which are seasonal, such as billings to customers for subscriptions and support services and the subsequent collection of those billings. As described above in Seasonal Nature of Deferred Revenue and Accounts Receivable, our fourth quarter has historically been our strongest quarter for new business and renewals. The year on year compounding effect of this seasonality in both billing patterns and overall business causes the value of invoices that we generate in the fourth quarter to increase as a proportion of our total annual billings. We generally invoice our customers for our subscription and services contracts in advance in annual installments. We typically issue renewal invoices in advance of the renewal service period, and depending on timing, the initial invoice for the subscription and services contract and the subsequent renewal invoice may occur in different quarters. Such invoice amounts are initially reflected in accounts receivable and deferred revenue, which is reflected on the balance sheet. The operating cash flow benefit of increased billing activity generally occurs in the subsequent quarter when we collect from our customers. As such, our first quarter has become our largest collections and operating cash flow quarter. Net cash provided by operating activities during fiscal 2015 increased $298.2 million over the same period a year ago primarily due to higher net income after adjusting for depreciation and amortization, loss on conversions of convertible senior notes, stock-based expenses and the timing of payments against accounts payable, accrued expenses and other current liabilities. Net cash used in investing activities was $698.4 million during fiscal 2015 and $2.4 billion during the same period a year ago. The net cash used in investing activities during fiscal 2015 primarily related to capital expenditures, including new office build-outs, investment of cash balances and strategic investments offset by proceeds from sales and maturities of marketable securities. Net cash used in investing activities during fiscal 2015 decreased by $1.7 billion over the same period a year ago primarily due to cash used for the acquisitions of ExactTarget, Inc. and EdgeSpring, Inc. during fiscal 2014 , offset by cash proceeds from sales of land and building improvements totaling $223.2 million and cash acquired of $38.1 million from business combinations during fiscal 2015 . Additionally, we made deposits totaling $126.4 million for the purchase of building and land during fiscal 2015 . Net cash used in financing activities was $310.5 million during fiscal 2015 as compared to net cash provided by financing activities of $1.6 billion during the same period a year ago. Net cash used in financing activities during fiscal 2015 consisted primarily of $568.9 million in principal payments on our 0.75% convertible senior notes, $70.7 million of principal payments on capital leases and $285.0 million of payments on our term loan, offset by $309.0 million from proceeds from equity plans and $297.3 million from our revolving credit facility. Net cash flows used in financing activities during fiscal 2015 changed $1.9 billion from the same period a year ago primarily due to $1.1 billion of proceeds from the issuance of convertible senior notes and related hedge transactions during fiscal 2014 , and an increase of $562.9 million in principal payments on our 0.75% convertible senior notes during fiscal 2015 . In January 2010, we issued $575.0 million of 0.75% convertible senior notes due January 15, 2015 (the 0.75% Senior Notes) and concurrently entered into convertible notes hedges (the 0.75% Note Hedges) and separate warrant transactions (the 0.75% Warrants). On January 15, 2015, the 0.75% Senior Notes matured. Upon maturity of the 0.75% Senior Notes, we delivered cash up to the remaining principal amount of the 0.75% Senior Notes and shares of our common stock for the excess conversion value greater than the principal amount of the 0.75% Senior Notes. As of January 31, 2015 , there is no remaining principal balance of the 0.75% Senior Notes outstanding. As a result of the conversions and maturity of the 0.75% Senior Notes during fiscal 2015 , the Company exercised its rights on the 0.75% Note Hedges, and the 0.75% Note Hedges expired. Additionally, in fiscal 2015 the Company entered into agreements with each of the 0.75% Warrant counterparties to amend and settle the 0.75% Warrants prior to their scheduled expiration beginning in April 2015. As a result, the Company issued, in the aggregate, approximately 13.3 million shares to the counterparties to settle, via a net share settlement, the entirety of the 0.75% Warrants. In March 2013, we issued $1.15 billion of 0.25% convertible senior notes due April 1, 2018 (the 0.25% Senior Notes) and concurrently entered into convertible notes hedges (the 0.25% Note Hedges) and separate warrant transactions (the 0.25% Warrants). The 0.25% Senior Notes will mature on April 1, 2018, unless earlier converted. Upon conversion of any 0.25% Senior Notes, we will deliver cash up to the principal amount of the 0.25% Senior Notes and, with respect to any excess conversion value greater than the principal amount of the 0.25% Senior Notes, shares of our common stock, cash, or a combination of both. The 0.25% Senior Notes will be convertible if during any 20 trading days during the 30 consecutive trading days of any fiscal quarter, our common stock trades at a price exceeding 130% of the conversion price of $66.44 per share applicable to the 0.25% Senior Notes. The 0.25% Senior Notes have not yet been convertible at the holders option. The 0.25% Senior Notes are classified as a noncurrent liability on our consolidated balance sheet as of January 31, 2015 . Our common stock did not trade at a price exceeding 130% of the conversion price of $66.44 per share applicable to the 0.25% Senior Notes during the fiscal quarter ended January 31, 2015 . Accordingly, the 0.25% Senior Notes will not be convertible at the holders option for the quarter ending April 30, 2015, and will remain classified as a noncurrent liability on our consolidated balance sheet. In July 2013, we entered into a credit agreement (the Prior Credit Agreement) with Bank of America, N.A. and certain other lenders, which provided for a $300.0 million term loan (the Term Loan). The Term Loan bore interest at our option under either a LIBOR-based formula or a base rate formula, each as set forth in the Prior Credit Agreement. On October 6, 2014, we repaid the Term Loan in full and terminated the Prior Credit Agreement. In October 2014, we entered into a credit agreement (the Credit Agreement) which provides for a $650.0 million unsecured revolving credit facility (the Credit Facility) that matures in October 2019. Immediately upon closing, we borrowed $300.0 million under the Credit Facility, approximately $262.5 million of which was used to repay in full the indebtedness under our Term Loan. We may use any future borrowings under the Credit Facility for working capital, capital expenditures and other general corporate purposes, including permitted acquisitions. We may borrow amounts under the Credit Facility at any time during the term of the Credit Agreement. We may also prepay the borrowings under the Credit Facility, in whole or in part, at any time without premium or penalty, subject to certain conditions, and amounts repaid or prepaid may be reborrowed. Borrowings under the Credit Facility bear interest, at our option at either a base rate formula or a LIBOR based formula, each as set forth in the Credit Agreement. Additionally, we are obligated to pay an ongoing commitment fee at a rate between 0.125% and 0.25%. Interest and the commitment fee are payable in arrears quarterly. The Credit Agreement contains certain customary affirmative and negative covenants, including a consolidated leverage ratio covenant, a consolidated interest coverage ratio covenant, a limit on our ability to incur additional indebtedness, dispose of assets, make certain acquisition transactions, pay dividends or distributions, and certain other restrictions on our activities each defined specifically in the Credit Agreement. We were in compliance with the Credit Agreements covenants as of January 31, 2015 . The weighted average interest rate on borrowings under the Credit Facility was 1.7% for the period beginning October 6, 2014 and ended January 31, 2015 . As of January 31, 2015 , outstanding borrowings under the Credit Facility were $300.0 million. In August 2014, we sold approximately 3.7 net acres of our undeveloped real estate in San Francisco for a total of $72.5 million. Separately, in September 2014, we sold approximately 1.5 net acres of our undeveloped real estate for a total of $125.0 million. We have 8.8 net acres remaining for sale as of January 31, 2015. In February 2015, we acquired 50 Fremont Street, a 41-story building totaling approximately 817,000 rentable square feet located in San Francisco, California (50 Fremont). We acquired 50 Fremont for the purpose of expanding our global headquarters in San Francisco. As of January 31, 2015, we were leasing approximately 500,000 square feet of the available space in 50 Fremont. See Note 14, Subsequent Event in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The total purchase price for 50 Fremont was $629.3 million. To pay for 50 Fremont, we used $115.0 million of restricted cash and assumed a $200.0 million loan secured by the property with the remainder paid in cash. Our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities are comprised primarily of corporate notes and other obligations, U.S. treasury securities, U.S. agency obligations, government obligations, collateralized mortgage obligations, mortgage backed securities, time deposits, money market mutual funds and municipal securities. As of January 31, 2015 , we have a total of $63.8 million in letters of credit outstanding in favor of certain landlords for office space. To date, no amounts have been drawn against the letters of credit, which renew annually and expire at various dates through December 2030. We do not have any special purpose entities, and other than operating leases for office space and computer equipment, we do not engage in off-balance sheet financing arrangements. Our principal commitments consist of obligations under leases for office space, co-location data center facilities, and our development and test data center, as well as leases for computer equipment, software, furniture and fixtures. At January 31, 2015 , the future non-cancelable minimum payments under these commitments were as follows (in thousands):  ##TABLE_START Contractual Obligations Payments Due by Period  Total  Less than 1 Year  1-3 Years  3-5 Years  More than 5 Years Capital lease obligations, including interest $ 651,344  $ 104,825  $ 232,241  $ 314,278  $ Operating lease obligations:          Facilities space 2,027,140  178,552  351,882  372,336  1,124,370 Computer equipment and furniture and fixtures 251,834  110,995  139,854   0.25% Convertible Senior Notes, including interest 1,160,422  2,875  6,109  1,151,438  Revolving Credit Facility 300,000    300,000  Financing obligation - building in progress - leased facility 335,824  1,777  37,984  43,546  252,517 Contractual commitments 18,823  1,316  2,598  14,909   $ 4,745,387  $ 400,340  $ 770,668  $ 2,197,492  $ 1,376,887 ##TABLE_ENDThe majority of our operating lease agreements provide us with the option to renew. Our future operating lease obligations would change if we exercised these options and if we entered into additional operating lease agreements as we expand our operations. The financing obligation above represents the total obligation for our lease of approximately 445,000 rentable square feet of office space in San Francisco, California. As of January 31, 2015 , $125.3 million of the total obligation noted above was recorded to Financing obligation, building in progress - leased facility, which is included in Other noncurrent liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets. In April 2014, we entered into an office lease agreement to lease approximately 714,000 rentable square feet of an office building located in San Francisco, California that is under construction. The lease payments associated with the lease will be approximately $560.0 million over the 15.5 year term of the lease, beginning in our first quarter of fiscal 2018, which is reflected above under Operating Leases. Subsequent to January 31, 2015, we acquired 50 Fremont. As of January 31, 2015, we had been leasing approximately 500,000 square feet of 50 Fremont (see Note 14 Subsequent Event in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements). The lease, which was signed in January 2012, is reflected above under Operating lease obligations, and the commitment totals $238.5 million. The operating lease commitment is as follows: $16.1 million during fiscal 2016; $16.6 million during fiscal 2017; $17.1 million during fiscal 2018; $17.6 million during fiscal 2019; $18.1 million during fiscal 2020; and $153.0 thereafter. Beginning in the quarter ending April 30, 2015, this commitment will be removed from operating lease obligations. During fiscal 2015 and in future fiscal years, we have made and expect to continue to make additional investments in our infrastructure to scale our operations and increase productivity. We plan to upgrade or replace various internal systems to scale with the overall growth of the Company. Additionally, we expect capital expenditures to be higher in absolute dollars and remain consistent as a percentage of total revenues in future periods as a result of continued office build-outs, other leasehold improvements and data center investments. In the future, we may enter into arrangements to acquire or invest in complementary businesses or joint ventures, services and technologies, and intellectual property rights. We may be required to seek additional equity or debt financing. Additional funds may not be available on terms favorable to us or at all. We believe our existing cash, cash equivalents and short-term marketable securities and cash provided by operating activities will be sufficient to meet our working capital, capital expenditure and debt repayment needs over the next 12 months. New Accounting Pronouncement In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) (ASU 2014-09) which amended the existing FASB Accounting Standards Codification. This standard establishes a principle for recognizing revenue upon the transfer of promised goods or services to customers, in an amount that reflects the expected consideration received in exchange for those goods or services. The standard also provides guidance on the recognition of costs related to obtaining and fulfilling customer contracts. ASU 2014-09 is effective for fiscal 2018, including interim periods within that reporting period. Early adoption is not permitted. We are currently in the process of assessing the adoption methodology, which allows the amendment to be applied retrospectively to each prior period presented, or with the cumulative effect recognized as of the date of initial application. We are also evaluating the impact of the adoption of ASU 2014-09 on our consolidated financial statements and have not determined whether the effect will be material to either our revenue results or our deferred commissions balances. Non-GAAP Financial Measures Regulation S-K Item 10(e), Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures in Commission Filings, defines and prescribes the conditions for use of non-GAAP financial information. Our measures of non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP operating profit, non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP earnings per share each meet the definition of a non-GAAP financial measure. Non-GAAP gross profit, Non-GAAP operating profit and Non-GAAP net income We use the non-GAAP measures of non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP operating profit and non-GAAP net income to provide an additional view of operational performance by excluding expenses and benefits that are not directly related to performance in any particular period. In addition to our GAAP measures we use these non-GAAP measures when planning, monitoring, and evaluating our performance. We believe that these non-GAAP measures reflect our ongoing business in a manner that allows for meaningful period-to-period comparisons and analysis of trends in our business, as they exclude certain expenses and benefits. These items are excluded because the decisions which gave rise to them are not made to increase revenue in a particular period, but are made for our long-term benefit over multiple periods and we are not able to change or affect these items in any particular period. We define non-GAAP net income as our total net income excluding the following components, which we believe are not reflective of our ongoing operational expenses. In each case, for the reasons set forth below, we believe that excluding the component provides useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating the impact of certain items to our operating results and future prospects in the same manner as us, in comparing financial results across accounting periods and to those of peer companies and to better understand the impact of these items on our gross margin and operating performance. Additionally, as significant, unusual or discrete events occur, the results may be excluded in the period in which the events occur.  ##TABLE_START  Stock-Based Expense . The Companys compensation strategy includes the use of stock-based compensation to attract and retain employees and executives. It is principally aimed at aligning their interests with those of our stockholders and at long-term employee retention, rather than to motivate or reward operational performance for any particular period. Thus, stock-based expense varies for reasons that are generally unrelated to operational decisions and performance in any particular period. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Amortization of Purchased Intangibles. The Company views amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets, such as the amortization of the cost associated with an acquired companys research and development efforts, trade names, customer lists and customer relationships, as items arising from pre-acquisition activities determined at the time of an acquisition. While it is continually viewed for impairment, amortization of the cost of purchased intangibles is a static expense, one that is not typically affected by operations during any particular period. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Amortization of Debt Discount. Under GAAP, certain convertible debt instruments that may be settled in cash (or other assets) on conversion are required to be separately accounted for as liability (debt) and equity (conversion option) components of the instrument in a manner that reflects the issuers non-convertible debt borrowing rate. Accordingly, for GAAP purposes we are required to recognize imputed interest expense on the Companys $575.0 million of convertible senior notes that were issued in a private placement in January 2010 and the Companys $1.15 billion of convertible senior notes that were issued in a private placement in March 2013. The imputed interest rates were approximately 5.86% for the notes issued in January 2010 and approximately 2.53% for the notes issued in March 2013, while the coupon interest rates were 0.75% and 0.25%, respectively. The difference between the imputed interest expense and the coupon interest expense, net of the interest amount capitalized, is excluded from managements assessment of the Companys operating performance because management believes that this non-cash expense is not indicative of ongoing operating performance. Management believes that the exclusion of the non-cash interest expense provides investors an enhanced view of the Companys operational performance. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Non-Cash Gains/Losses on Conversions of Debt. Upon settlement of the Companys convertible senior notes, we attribute the fair value of the consideration transferred to the liability and equity components of the convertible senior notes. The difference between the fair value of consideration attributed to the liability component and the carrying value of the liability as of settlement date is recorded as a non-cash gain or loss on the statement of operations. Management believes that the exclusion of the non-cash gain/loss provides investors an enhanced view of the companys operational performance. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Gain on sales of land and building improvements.  The Company views the non-operating gains associated with the sales of the land and building improvements to be a discrete item. Management believes that the exclusion of the gains provides investors an enhanced view of the Companys operational performance. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Income Tax Effects and Adjustments . During fiscal 2014, the Companys non-GAAP tax provision excluded the tax effects of expense items described above and certain tax items not directly related to the current fiscal years ordinary operating results. Examples of such tax items included, but are not limited to, changes in the valuation allowance related to deferred tax assets, certain acquisition-related costs and unusual or infrequently occurring items. Management believes the exclusion of these income tax adjustments provides investors with useful supplemental information about the Companys operational performance. During fiscal 2015 , the Company began to compute and utilize a fixed long-term projected non-GAAP tax rate in order to provide better consistency across the interim reporting periods by eliminating the effects of non-recurring and period-specific items such as changes in the tax valuation allowance and tax effects of acquisitions-related costs, since each of these items can vary in size and frequency. When projecting this long-term rate, the Company evaluated a three-year financial projection that excludes the impact of the following items: Stock-Based Expenses, Amortization of Purchased Intangibles, Amortization of Debt Discount, Gains/Losses on Conversions of Debt, and Gains/Losses on sales of land and building improvements. The projected rate also assumes no new acquisitions in the three-year period, and takes into account other factors including the Companys current tax structure, its existing tax positions in various jurisdictions and key legislation in major jurisdictions where the Company operates. The non-GAAP tax rate for fiscal 2015 is 36.5%. The Company intends to re-evaluate this long-term rate on an annual basis or if any significant events that may materially affect this long-term rate occur. This long-term rate could be subject to change for a variety of reasons, for example, significant changes in the geographic earnings mix including acquisition activity, or fundamental tax law changes in major jurisdictions where the Company operates. ##TABLE_END We define non-GAAP gross profit as our total revenues less cost of revenues, as reported on our consolidated statement of operations, excluding the portions of stock-based expenses and amortization of purchased intangibles that are included in cost of revenues. We define non-GAAP operating profit as our non-GAAP gross profit less operating expenses, as reported on our consolidated statement of operations, excluding the portions of stock-based expenses and amortization of purchased intangibles that are included in operating expenses. Non-GAAP earnings per share Management uses the non-GAAP earnings per share to provide an additional view of performance by excluding items that are not directly related to performance in any particular period in the earnings per share calculation. We define non-GAAP earnings per share as our non-GAAP net income, which excludes the above components, which we believe are not reflective of our ongoing operational expenses, divided by basic or diluted shares outstanding. Limitations on the use of non-GAAP financial measures A limitation of our non-GAAP financial measures of non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP operating profit, non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP earnings per share is that they do not have uniform definitions. Our definitions will likely differ from the definitions used by other companies, including peer companies, and therefore comparability may be limited. Thus, our non-GAAP measures of non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP operating profit, non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP earnings per share should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, or in isolation from, measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. Additionally, in the case of stock-based expense, if we did not pay a portion of compensation in the form of stock-based expense, the cash salary expense included in costs of revenues and operating expenses would be higher which would affect our cash position. We compensate for these limitations by reconciling non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP operating profit, non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP earnings per share to the most comparable GAAP financial measure. We encourage investors and others to review our financial information in its entirety, not to rely on any single financial measure and to view our non-GAAP financial measures in conjunction with the most comparable GAAP financial measures. Our reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures of gross profit, operating profit, net income and earnings per share to the most comparable GAAP measure, gross profit, loss from operations, net income (loss) and net income (loss) per share for fiscal years 2015 , 2014 and 2013 are as follows (in thousands, except for share numbers):  ##TABLE_START   Fiscal Year Ended January 31,     Non-GAAP gross profit       GAAP gross profit  $ 4,084,316  $ 3,102,575  $ 2,366,616 Plus:       Amortization of purchased intangibles  90,300  109,356  77,249 Stock-based expenses  53,812  45,608  33,757 Non-GAAP gross profit  $ 4,228,428  $ 3,257,539  $ 2,477,622 ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START   Fiscal Year Ended January 31,     Non-GAAP operating profit       GAAP loss from operations  $ (145,633 )  $ (286,074 )  $ (110,710 ) Plus:       Amortization of purchased intangibles  154,973  146,535  88,171 Stock-based expenses  564,765  503,280  379,350 Non-GAAP operating profit  $ 574,105  $ 363,741  $ 356,811 ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START   Fiscal Year Ended January 31,     Non-GAAP net income       GAAP net loss  $ (262,688 )  $ (232,175 )  $ (270,445 ) Plus:       Amortization of purchased intangibles  154,973  146,535  88,171 Stock-based expenses  564,765  503,280  379,350 Amortization of debt discount, net  36,575  46,728  23,837 Loss on conversion of debt  10,326   Less:       Gain on sales of land and building improvements  (15,625 )   Income tax effects and adjustments of Non-GAAP items  (146,741 )  (242,729 )  21,629 Non-GAAP net income  $ 341,585  $ 221,853  $ 242,542 ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START   Fiscal Year Ended January 31,     Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share        GAAP diluted loss per share  $ (0.42 )  $ (0.39 )  $ (0.48 ) Plus:       Amortization of purchased intangibles  0.24  0.23  0.15 Stock-based expenses  0.87  0.79  0.64 Amortization of debt discount, net  0.06  0.07  0.04 Loss on conversion of debt  0.02  0.00  0.00 Less:       Gain on sales of land and building improvements  (0.02 )  0.00  0.00 Income tax effects and adjustments of Non-GAAP items  (0.23 )  (0.35 )  0.06 Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share  $ 0.52  $ 0.35  $ 0.41 Shares used in computing diluted net income per share  651,534  635,688  596,280 ##TABLE_ENDNon-GAAP operating profit for the year ended January 31, 2015 was $574.1 million and $363.7 million for the same period a year ago, an improvement of $210.4 million or 58 percent. During fiscal 2015 we remained focused on improving non-GAAP operating profit and expect to remain similarly focused in fiscal 2016. The effects of dilutive securities were not included in the GAAP calculation of diluted earnings/loss per share for the years ended January 31, 2015 , 2014 and 2013 because we had a net loss for those periods and the effect would have been anti-dilutive. The following table reflects the effect of the dilutive securities on the basic share count used in the GAAP earnings/loss per share calculation to derive the share count used for the non-GAAP diluted earnings per share:  ##TABLE_START   Fiscal Year Ended January 31, Supplemental Diluted Sharecount Information (in thousands):    Weighted-average shares outstanding for GAAP basic earnings per share  624,148  597,613  564,896 Effect of dilutive securities:       Convertible senior notes  5,381  14,550  11,360 Warrants associated with the convertible senior note hedges  9,536  9,658  5,132 Employee stock awards  12,469  13,867  14,892 Adjusted weighted-average shares outstanding and assumed conversions for Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share  651,534  635,688  596,280 ##TABLE_ENDSupplemental Tax Expense (Benefit) Information: As described above, beginning in February 2014, which was the start of our fiscal 2015, we changed the methodology used to calculate our non-GAAP tax expense. We have computed and are utilizing a fixed long-term projected non-GAAP tax rate of 36.5 percent for fiscal 2015. We moved to this long-term projected non-GAAP tax rate in order to provide better consistency across the interim reporting periods by eliminating the effects of non-recurring and period-specific items. As a result, we believe that starting in fiscal 2015, providing a tabular reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measure of tax expense (benefit) to the comparable GAAP measure is not appropriate given our new methodology. During the third quarter of fiscal 2013, we recorded for GAAP purposes a valuation allowance against a significant portion of our U.S. deferred tax assets. During fiscal 2014, we recorded a partial valuation allowance release, primarily in connection with the acquisition of ExactTarget. The increasing number of tax adjustments reflected below was the result of the GAAP valuation allowance and the Companys increasing acquisition activities. The following table for fiscal 2014 and 2013 reflects the calculation of our non-GAAP tax expense: ##TABLE_START     Fiscal Year Ended January 31, Non-GAAP tax expense (in thousands):     GAAP Tax Expense (Benefit)    (125,760 )  142,651 GAAP to Non-GAAP Adjustments - tax effects of:       Stock-based expenses, amortization of purchased intangibles and amortization of debt discount, net (1)    229,277  169,501 Deferred tax asset partial valuation (reserve) release (2)    25,048  (186,806 ) State income tax credits not benefited (3)    5,325  Acquisitions-related costs (4)    (19,708 )  Other, net (5)    2,787  (4,324 ) Total Adjustments    242,729  (21,629 ) Non-GAAP Tax Expense    116,969  121,022 ##TABLE_END(1) The Company excluded stock-based expenses, amortization of purchased intangibles, and amortization of debt discount, net, in reporting its non-GAAP net income. Accordingly, the Company excluded the related tax effects of these items. The related tax effects were computed by applying the relevant statutory tax rate to these items for each respective jurisdiction. (2) During fiscal 2013, the Company evaluated both positive and negative evidence related to the likelihood of the realization of the deferred tax assets and determined that the negative evidence outweighed the positive evidence due to the cumulative GAAP loss in recent years and forecasted future GAAP losses. As a result, a valuation allowance was established against a significant portion of the deferred tax assets in Q3 fiscal 2013. However, a valuation allowance would not be necessary on a non-GAAP basis given the Companys non-GAAP operating income. As a result, the Company excluded its GAAP valuation allowance recorded during the period when computing its non-GAAP tax expense. (3) During fiscal 2014, California mandated a change to the way it apportioned income to the state, which significantly reduced the Companys California income tax expense. Accordingly, for computing non-GAAP tax expense, the Company did not recognize tax benefits related to certain California research and development tax credits as the Company believed these credits may not be realized given the lowered California income tax expense. (4) During fiscal 2014, the Company excluded certain tax effects related to acquisitions in computing its non-GAAP tax expense. The majority of this adjustment was attributable to non-cash tax costs associated with the transfer of purchased intangibles. This non-cash tax item was excluded because the decisions which gave rise to these non-cash tax costs were neither made to increase revenue nor directly related to performance in any particular period, but were made for the Companys long term benefit over multiple periods. The remainder of this adjustment included the tax effects of legal and accounting fees incurred to facilitate transactions, which amount was not material. The related tax effects were computed by applying the relevant statutory tax rate to these items for each respective jurisdiction. (5) Other, net included multiple items that were immaterial either on an individual basis or an aggregate basis. ##TABLE_START ", "7A": " ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK ##TABLE_END Foreign Currency Exchange Risk Our results of operations and cash flows are subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates, particularly changes in the Euro, British Pound Sterling, Canadian Dollar, Australian Dollar and Japanese Yen. We seek to minimize the impact of certain foreign currency fluctuations by hedging certain balance sheet exposures with foreign currency forward contracts. Any gain or loss from settling these contracts is offset by the loss or gain derived from the underlying balance sheet exposures. In accordance with our policy, the hedging contracts we enter into have maturities of less than three months. Additionally, by policy, we do not enter into any hedging contracts for trading or speculative purposes. Interest Rate Sensitivity We had cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaling $1.9 billion at January 31, 2015 . This amount was invested primarily in money market funds, time deposits, corporate notes and bonds, government securities and other debt securities with credit ratings of at least BBB or better. The cash, cash equivalents and short-term marketable securities are held for general corporate purposes including possible acquisitions of, or investments in, complementary businesses, services or technologies, working capital and capital expenditures. Our investments are made for capital preservation purposes. We do not enter into investments for trading or speculative purposes. Our cash equivalents and our portfolio of marketable securities are subject to market risk due to changes in interest rates. Fixed rate securities may have their market value adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates, while floating rate securities may produce less income than expected if interest rates fall. Due in part to these factors, our future investment income may fall short of expectation due to changes in interest rates or we may suffer losses in principal if we are forced to sell securities that decline in market value due to changes in interest rates. However because we classify our debt securities as available for sale, no gains or losses are recognized due to changes in interest rates unless such securities are sold prior to maturity or declines in fair value are determined to be other-than-temporary. Our fixed-income portfolio is subject to interest rate risk. An immediate increase or decrease in interest rates of 100-basis points at January 31, 2015 could result in a $13.5 million market value reduction or increase of the same amount. This estimate is based on a sensitivity model that measures market value changes when changes in interest rates occur. Fluctuations in the value of our investment securities caused by a change in interest rates (gains or losses on the carrying value) are recorded in other comprehensive income, and are realized only if we sell the underlying securities. As of January 31, 2015 , we had restricted cash totaling $115.0 million that was held in a money market account, which is subject to market risk due to changes in interest rates. At January 31, 2014 , we had cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaling $1.3 billion . The fixed-income portfolio was also subject to interest rate risk. Changes in interest rates of 100-basis points would have resulted in market value changes of $8.8 million. Market Risk and Market Interest Risk In March 2013, we issued at par value $1.15 billion of 0.25% convertible senior notes (the 0.25% Senior Notes) (collectively the Notes). Holders of the 0.25% Senior Notes may convert the 0.25% Senior Notes prior to maturity upon the occurrence of certain circumstances. Upon conversion, we would pay the holder an amount of cash equal to the principal amounts of the Notes. For the 0.25% Senior Notes, the amounts in excess of the principal amounts, if any, may be paid in cash or stock at our option. Concurrent with the issuance of the Notes, we entered into separate note hedging transactions and the sale of warrants. These separate transactions were completed to reduce the potential economic dilution from the conversion of the Notes. The 0.25% Senior Notes have a fixed annual interest rate of 0.25%, and therefore we do not have economic interest rate exposure on the Notes. However, the value of the Notes are exposed to interest rate risk. Generally, the fair values of our fixed interest rate Notes will increase as interest rates fall and decrease as interest rates rise. In addition, the fair value of our 0.25% Notes is affected by our stock price. The principal balance of our 0.25% Senior Notes was $1.15 billion as of January 31, 2015 . The total estimated fair value of our 0.25% Senior Notes at January 31, 2015 was $1.3 billion . The fair value was determined based on the closing trading price per $100 of the 0.25% Senior Notes as of the last day of trading for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015 , which was $110.87. In October 2014, we entered into a credit agreement (the Credit Agreement) which provides for a $650.0 million unsecured revolving credit facility that matures in October 2019 (the Credit Facility). Immediately upon closing, we borrowed $300.0 million under the Credit Facility. Borrowings under the Credit Facility bear interest, at our option, at either a base rate formula, as defined in the Credit Agreement, or a LIBOR based formula, each as set forth in the Credit Agreement. Additionally, we are obligated to pay an ongoing commitment fee at a rate between 0.125% and 0.25%. Interest and the commitment fees are payable in arrears quarterly. By entering into the Credit Agreement, we have assumed risks associated with variable interest rates based upon a variable base rate, as defined in the Credit Agreement, or LIBOR. The weighted average interest rate on the Credit Facility was 1.7% for the period beginning October 6, 2014 and ended January 31, 2015 . Changes in the overall level of interest rates affect the interest expense that we recognize in our statements of operations. We deposit our cash with multiple financial institutions, therefore our deposits, at times, may exceed federally insured limits. The bank counterparties to the derivative contracts potentially expose us to credit-related losses in the event of their nonperformance. To mitigate that risk, we only contract with counterparties who meet the minimum requirements under our counterparty risk assessment process. We monitor ratings, credit spreads and potential downgrades on at least a quarterly basis. Based on our on-going assessment of counterparty risk, we adjust our exposure to various counterparties. We generally enter into master netting arrangements, which reduce credit risk by permitting net settlement of transactions with the same counterparty. However, we do not have any master netting arrangements in place with collateral features. We have an investment portfolio that includes strategic investments in public and privately-held companies, many of which are in the development stage. When our ownership interests are less than 20 percent and we do not have the ability to exert significant influence, we account for investments in non-marketable equity and debt securities of the privately-held companies using the cost method of accounting. Otherwise, we account for the investments using the equity method of accounting. Our portfolio consists of investments in approximately 100 companies, with our investments in these companies ranging from $0.2 million to $40.0 million. As of January 31, 2015 and January 31, 2014 the carrying value of our investments in privately-held companies was $158.0 million and $77.0 million , respectively. The estimated fair value of our investments in privately-held companies was $280.0 million as of January 31, 2015 .  ##TABLE_START ", "8": " ITEM 8.

Our audits also included the financial statement schedule listed in the Index at Item 15(c). These financial statements and schedule are the responsibility of the companys management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and schedule based on our audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of salesforce.com, inc. at January 31, 2015 and 2014, and the consolidated results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended January 31, 2015, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Also, in our opinion, the related financial statement schedule, when considered in relation to the basic financial statements taken as a whole, presents fairly in all material respects the information set forth therein. We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), salesforce.com inc.s internal control over financial reporting as of January 31, 2015, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission 2013 framework and our report dated March 5, 2015 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon. /s/ E RNST  Y OUNG LLP San Jose, California March 5, 2015 Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm The Board of Directors and Stockholders of salesforce.com, inc.  We have audited salesforce.com, inc.s internal control over financial reporting as of January 31, 2015, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission 2013 framework (the COSO criteria). salesforce.com, inc.s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Managements Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the companys internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.  We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.  A companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.  Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.  In our opinion, salesforce.com, inc. maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of January 31, 2015, based on the COSO criteria.  We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated balance sheets of salesforce.com, inc. as of January 31, 2015 and 2014, and the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive loss, stockholders equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended January 31, 2015 of salesforce.com, inc. and our report dated March 5, 2015 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.  /s/ E RNST  Y OUNG LLP San Jose, California March 5, 2015 salesforce.com, inc.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements 1. Summary of Business and Significant Accounting Policies Description of Business Salesforce.com, inc. (the Company) is a leading provider of enterprise cloud computing services. The Company is dedicated to helping customers of all sizes and industries worldwide transform themselves into customer companies by empowering them to connect with their customers, partners, employees and products in entirely new ways. The Company provides customers with the solutions they need to build a next generation social front office with social and mobile cloud technologies. Fiscal Year The Companys fiscal year ends on January 31. References to fiscal 2015, for example, refer to the fiscal year ending January 31, 2015 . Basis of Presentation On March 20, 2013, the Companys certificate of incorporation was amended to increase the number of authorized shares of common stock from 400.0 million to 1.6 billion in order to provide for a four -for-one stock split of the common stock effected in the form of a stock dividend. The record date for the stock split was April 3, 2013, and the additional shares were distributed on April 17, 2013. Each stockholder of record on the close of business on the record date received three additional shares of common stock for each share held. All share and per share data presented herein reflect the impact of the increase in authorized shares and the stock split, as appropriate. Use of Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions in the Companys consolidated financial statements and notes thereto. Significant estimates and assumptions made by management include the determination of: ##TABLE_START  the best estimate of selling price of the deliverables included in multiple deliverable revenue arrangements, ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed for business combinations, ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  the recognition, measurement and valuation of current and deferred income taxes, ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  the fair value of convertible notes, ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  the fair value of stock awards issued and related forfeiture rates, ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  the valuation of strategic investments and the determination of other-than-temporary impairments, and ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  the assessment of determination of impairment of long-lived assets (property and equipment, goodwill and identified intangibles). ##TABLE_END Actual results could differ materially from those estimates. Principles of Consolidation The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. Segments The Company operates as one operating segment. Operating segments are defined as components of an enterprise for which separate financial information is evaluated regularly by the chief operating decision maker, who is the chief executive officer, in deciding how to allocate resources and assessing performance. Over the past few years, the Company has completed several acquisitions. These acquisitions have allowed the Company to expand its offerings, presence and reach in various market segments of the enterprise cloud computing market. While the Company has offerings in multiple enterprise cloud computing market segments, the Companys business operates in one operating segment because all of the Company's offerings operate on a single platform and are deployed in an identical way, and  the Companys chief operating decision maker evaluates the Companys financial information and resources and assesses the performance of these resources on a consolidated basis. Since the Company operates in one operating segment, all required financial segment information can be found in the consolidated financial statements. Concentrations of Credit Risk and Significant Customers The Companys financial instruments that are exposed to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities, restricted cash and trade accounts receivable. Although the Company deposits its cash with multiple financial institutions, its deposits, at times, may exceed federally insured limits. Collateral is not required for accounts receivable. The Company maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts receivable balances. This allowance is based upon historical loss patterns, the number of days that billings are past due and an evaluation of the potential risk of loss associated with delinquent accounts. No single customer accounted for more than five percent of accounts receivable at January 31, 2015 and January 31, 2014 . No single customer accounted for five percent or more of total revenue during fiscal 2015 , 2014 and 2013 . Geographic Locations As of January 31, 2015 and 2014 , assets located outside the Americas were 12 percent and 12 percent of total assets, respectively. Revenues by geographical region are as follows (in thousands):  ##TABLE_START   Fiscal Year Ended January 31,     Americas  $ 3,868,329  $ 2,899,837  $ 2,123,736 Europe  984,919  741,220  525,304 Asia Pacific  520,338  429,946  401,155  $ 5,373,586  $ 4,071,003  $ 3,050,195 ##TABLE_ENDAmericas revenue attributed to the United States was approximately 94 percent , 96 percent and 94 percent in fiscal 2015 , 2014 and 2013 , respectively. No other country represented more than ten percent of total revenue during fiscal 2015 , 2014 or 2013 . Revenue Recognition The Company derives its revenues from two sources: (1) subscription revenues, which are comprised of subscription fees from customers accessing the Companys enterprise cloud computing services and from customers paying for additional support beyond the standard support that is included in the basic subscription fees; and (2) related professional services such as process mapping, project management, implementation services and other revenue. Other revenue consists primarily of training fees. The Company commences revenue recognition when all of the following conditions are satisfied: ##TABLE_START  there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  the service has been or is being provided to the customer; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  the collection of the fees is reasonably assured; and ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  the amount of fees to be paid by the customer is fixed or determinable. ##TABLE_END 68 The Companys subscription service arrangements are non-cancelable and do not contain refund-type provisions. Subscription and Support Revenues Subscription and support revenues are recognized ratably over the contract terms beginning on the commencement date of each contract, which is the date the Companys service is made available to customers. Amounts that have been invoiced are recorded in accounts receivable and in deferred revenue or revenue, depending on whether the revenue recognition criteria have been met. Professional Services and Other Revenues The majority of the Companys professional services contracts are on a time and material basis. When these services are not combined with subscription revenues as a single unit of accounting, as discussed below, these revenues are recognized as the services are rendered for time and material contracts, and when the milestones are achieved and accepted by the customer for fixed price contracts. Training revenues are recognized as the services are performed. Multiple Deliverable Arrangements The Company enters into arrangements with multiple deliverables that generally include multiple subscriptions, premium support and professional services. If the deliverables have standalone value upon delivery, the Company accounts for each deliverable separately. Subscription services have standalone value as such services are often sold separately. In determining whether professional services have standalone value, the Company considers the following factors for each professional services agreement: availability of the services from other vendors, the nature of the professional services, the timing of when the professional services contract was signed in comparison to the subscription service start date and the contractual dependence of the subscription service on the customers satisfaction with the professional services work. To date, the Company has concluded that all of the professional services included in multiple deliverable arrangements executed have standalone value. Multiple deliverables included in an arrangement are separated into different units of accounting and the arrangement consideration is allocated to the identified separate units based on a relative selling price hierarchy. The Company determines the relative selling price for a deliverable based on its vendor-specific objective evidence of selling price (VSOE), if available, or its best estimate of selling price (BESP), if VSOE is not available. The Company has determined that third-party evidence of selling price (TPE) is not a practical alternative due to differences in its service offerings compared to other parties and the availability of relevant third-party pricing information. The amount of revenue allocated to delivered items is limited by contingent revenue, if any. For certain professional services, the Company has established VSOE as a consistent number of standalone sales of these deliverables have been priced within a reasonably narrow range. The Company has not established VSOE for its subscription services due to lack of pricing consistency, the introduction of new services and other factors. Accordingly, the Company uses its BESP to determine the relative selling price for its subscription services. The Company determines BESP by considering its overall pricing objectives and market conditions. Significant pricing practices taken into consideration include the Companys discounting practices, the size and volume of the Companys transactions, the customer demographic, the geographic area where services are sold, price lists, its go-to-market strategy, historical standalone sales and contract prices. The determination of BESP is made through consultation with and approval by the Companys management, taking into consideration the go-to-market strategy. As the Companys go-to-market strategies evolve, the Company may modify its pricing practices in the future, which could result in changes in relative selling prices, including both VSOE and BESP. Deferred Revenue The deferred revenue balance does not represent the total contract value of annual or multi-year, non-cancelable subscription agreements. Deferred revenue primarily consists of billings or payments received in advance of revenue recognition from subscription services described above and is recognized as the revenue recognition criteria are met. The Company generally invoices customers in annual installments. The deferred revenue balance is influenced by several factors, including seasonality, the compounding effects of renewals, invoice duration, invoice timing, size and new business linearity within the quarter. Deferred revenue that will be recognized during the succeeding twelve month period is recorded as current deferred revenue and the remaining portion is recorded as noncurrent. Deferred Commissions Deferred commissions are the incremental costs that are directly associated with non-cancelable subscription contracts with customers and consist of sales commissions paid to the Companys direct sales force. The commissions are deferred and amortized over the non-cancelable terms of the related customer contracts, which are typically 12 to 36 months . The commission payments are paid in full the month after the customers service commences. The deferred commission amounts are recoverable through the future revenue streams under the non-cancelable customer contracts. The Company believes this is the preferable method of accounting as the commission charges are so closely related to the revenue from the non-cancelable customer contracts that they should be recorded as an asset and charged to expense over the same period that the subscription revenue is recognized. Amortization of deferred commissions is included in marketing and sales expense in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations. Cash and Cash Equivalents The Company considers all highly liquid investments purchased with an original maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents. Cash and cash equivalents are stated at fair value. Marketable Securities Management determines the appropriate classification of marketable securities at the time of purchase and reevaluates such determination at each balance sheet date. Securities are classified as available for sale and are carried at fair value, with the change in unrealized gains and losses, net of tax, reported as a separate component on the consolidated statements of comprehensive loss. Fair value is determined based on quoted market rates when observable or utilizing data points that are observable, such as quoted prices, interest rates and yield curves. Declines in fair value judged to be other-than-temporary on securities available for sale are included as a component of investment income. In order to determine whether a decline in value is other-than-temporary, the Company evaluates, among other factors: the duration and extent to which the fair value has been less than the carrying value and its intent and ability to retain the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in fair value. The cost of securities sold is based on the specific-identification method. Interest on securities classified as available for sale is also included as a component of investment income. Fair Value Measurement The Company measures its cash equivalents, marketable securities and foreign currency derivative contracts at fair value. The additional disclosures regarding the Companys fair value measurements are included in Note 2 Investments. Property and Equipment Property and equipment are stated at cost. Depreciation is calculated on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of those assets as follows:  ##TABLE_START Computer, equipment and software 3 to 9 years Furniture and fixtures 5 years Leasehold improvements Shorter of the estimated lease term or 10 years Building improvements Amortized over the estimated useful lives of the respective assets when they are ready for their intended use ##TABLE_ENDWhen assets are retired or otherwise disposed of, the cost and accumulated depreciation and amortization are removed from their respective accounts and any loss on such retirement is reflected in operating expenses. Capitalized Internal-Use Software Costs The Company capitalizes costs related to its enterprise cloud computing services and certain projects for internal use incurred during the application development stage. Costs related to preliminary project activities and post implementation activities are expensed as incurred. Internal-use software is amortized on a straight-line basis over its estimated useful life, which is generally three to five years. Management evaluates the useful lives of these assets on an annual basis and tests for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances occur that could impact the recoverability of these assets. Goodwill, Intangible Assets, Long-Lived Assets and Impairment Assessments The Company evaluates and tests the recoverability of its goodwill for impairment at least annually during the fourth quarter or more often if and when circumstances indicate that goodwill may not be recoverable. Intangible assets are amortized over their useful lives. Each period the Company evaluates the estimated remaining useful life of its intangible assets and whether events or changes in circumstances warrant a revision to the remaining period of amortization. The carrying amounts of these assets are periodically reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of these assets may not be recoverable. Recoverability of these assets is measured by comparison of the carrying amount of each asset to the future undiscounted cash flows the asset is expected to generate. If the undiscounted cash flows used in the test for recoverability are less than the carrying amount of these assets, then the carrying amount of such assets is reduced to fair value. The Company evaluates the recoverability of its long-lived assets for possible impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable. If such review indicates that the carrying amount of long-lived assets is not recoverable, the carrying amount of such assets is reduced to fair value. Business Combinations The Company uses its best estimates and assumptions to accurately assign fair value to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date. The Companys estimates are inherently uncertain and subject to refinement. During the measurement period, which may be up to one year from the acquisition date, the Company may record adjustments to the fair value of these tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed, with the corresponding offset to goodwill. In addition, uncertain tax positions and tax-related valuation allowances are initially established in connection with a business combination as of the acquisition date. The Company continues to collect information and reevaluates these estimates and assumptions quarterly and records any adjustments to the Companys preliminary estimates to goodwill provided that the Company is within the measurement period. Upon the conclusion of the measurement period or final determination of the fair value of assets acquired or liabilities assumed, whichever comes first, any subsequent adjustments are recorded to the Companys consolidated statements of operations. Leases and Asset Retirement Obligations The Company categorizes leases at their inception as either operating or capital leases. In certain lease agreements, the Company may receive rent holidays and other incentives. The Company recognizes lease costs on a straight-line basis once control of the space is achieved, without regard to deferred payment terms such as rent holidays that defer the commencement date of required payments. Additionally, incentives received are treated as a reduction of costs over the term of the agreement. The Company establishes assets and liabilities for the present value of estimated future costs to retire long-lived assets at the termination or expiration of a lease. Such assets are depreciated over the lease period into operating expense, and the recorded liabilities are accreted to the future value of the estimated retirement costs. The Company records assets and liabilities for the estimated construction costs incurred under build-to-suit lease arrangements to the extent it is involved in the construction of structural improvements or takes construction risk prior to commencement of a lease. Accounting for Stock-Based Expense The Company recognizes stock-based expenses related to stock options and restricted stock awards on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period of the awards, which is generally the vesting term of four years . The Company recognizes stock-based expenses related to shares issued pursuant to its 2004 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (ESPP) on a straight-line basis over the offering period, which is 12 months . Stock-based expenses are recognized net of estimated forfeiture activity. The estimated forfeiture rate applied is based on historical forfeiture rates. The Company does not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future and therefore uses an expected dividend yield of zero in the option pricing model. The fair value of each stock option grant was estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model with the following assumptions and fair value per share:  ##TABLE_START   Fiscal Year Ended January 31,   Stock Options        Volatility  %  37-43 %  43 - 51 %  Estimated life  3.6 years   3.4 years   3.7 years   Risk-free interest rate  1.12-1.53 %  0.48-1.21 %  0.43-0.77 %  Weighted-average fair value per share of grants  $ 17.20   $ 14.08   $ 12.94   ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START              Fiscal Year Ended January 31,   ESPP        Volatility  32-35 %  31-35 %  39 - 46 %  Estimated life  0.75 years   0.75 years   0.75 years   Risk-free interest rate  0.07-0.23 %  0.07-0.10 %  0.03-0.22 %  Weighted-average fair value per share of grants  $ 14.56   $ 10.30   $ 11.39   ##TABLE_ENDThe Company estimated its future stock price volatility considering both its observed option-implied volatilities and its historical volatility calculations. Management believes this is the best estimate of the expected volatility over the expected life of its stock options and stock purchase rights. The estimated life for the stock options was based on an analysis of historical exercise activity. The estimated life of the ESPP was based on the two purchase periods within each offering period. The risk-free interest rate is based on the rate for a U.S. government security with the same estimated life at the time of the option grant and the stock purchase rights. Advertising Expenses Advertising is expensed as incurred. Advertising expense was $203.6 million , $155.8 million and $110.7 million for fiscal 2015 , 2014 and 2013 , respectively. Income Taxes The Company uses the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on temporary differences between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax laws is recognized in the consolidated statement of operations in the period that includes the enactment date. The Companys tax positions are subject to income tax audits by multiple tax jurisdictions throughout the world. The Company recognizes the tax benefit of an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the position is sustainable upon examination by the taxing authority, solely based on its technical merits. The tax benefit recognized is measured as the largest amount of benefit which is greater than 50 percent likely to be realized upon settlement with the taxing authority. The Company recognizes interest accrued and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in the income tax provision. Valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amounts that are more likely than not expected to be realized based on the weighting of positive and negative evidence. Future realization of deferred tax assets ultimately depends on the existence of sufficient taxable income of the appropriate character (for example, ordinary income or capital gain) within the carryback or carryforward periods available under the applicable tax law. The Company regularly reviews the deferred tax assets for recoverability based on historical taxable income, projected future taxable income, the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences and tax planning strategies. The Companys judgments regarding future profitability may change due to many factors, including future market conditions and the ability to successfully execute its business plans and/or tax planning strategies. Should there be a change in the ability to recover deferred tax assets, the tax provision would increase or decrease in the period in which the assessment is changed. Foreign Currency Translation The functional currency of the Companys major foreign subsidiaries is generally the local currency. Adjustments resulting from translating foreign functional currency financial statements into U.S. dollars are recorded as a separate component on the consolidated statements of comprehensive loss. Foreign currency transaction gains and losses are included in net loss for the period. All assets and liabilities denominated in a foreign currency are translated into U.S. dollars at the exchange rate on the balance sheet date. Revenues and expenses are translated at the average exchange rate during the period. Equity transactions are translated using historical exchange rates. Warranties and Indemnification The Companys enterprise cloud computing services are typically warranted to perform in a manner consistent with general industry standards that are reasonably applicable and materially in accordance with the Companys online help documentation under normal use and circumstances. The Companys arrangements generally include certain provisions for indemnifying customers against liabilities if its products or services infringe a third partys intellectual property rights. To date, the Company has not incurred any material costs as a result of such obligations and has not accrued any liabilities related to such obligations in the accompanying consolidated financial statements. The Company has also agreed to indemnify its directors and executive officers for costs associated with any fees, expenses, judgments, fines and settlement amounts incurred by any of these persons in any action or proceeding to which any of those persons is, or is threatened to be, made a party by reason of the persons service as a director or officer, including any action by the Company, arising out of that persons services as the Companys director or officer or that persons services provided to any other company or enterprise at the Companys request.

New Accounting Pronouncement In May 2014 , the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) (ASU 2014-09) which amended the existing FASB Accounting Standards Codification. This standard establishes a principle for recognizing revenue upon the transfer of promised goods or services to customers, in an amount that reflects the expected consideration received in exchange for those goods or services. The standard also provides guidance on the recognition of costs related to obtaining and fulfilling customer contracts. ASU 2014-09 is effective for fiscal 2018 , including interim periods within that reporting period. Early adoption is not permitted. The Company is currently in the process of assessing the adoption methodology, which allows the amendment to be applied retrospectively to each prior period presented, or with the cumulative effect recognized as of the date of initial application. The Company is also evaluating the impact of the adoption of ASU 2014-09 on its consolidated financial statements and has not determined whether the effect will be material to either its revenue results or its deferred commissions balances. Reclassifications Certain reclassifications to the fiscal 2014 balances were made to conform to the current period presentation in the Statement of Cash Flows. These reclassifications include loss on conversions and amortization of debt discount. 2.

The Company expects to receive the full principal and interest on all of these marketable securities. Fair Value Measurement All of the Companys cash equivalents, marketable securities and foreign currency derivative contracts are classified within Level 1 or Level 2 because the Companys cash equivalents, marketable securities and foreign currency derivative contracts are valued using quoted market prices or alternative pricing sources and models utilizing observable market inputs. The Company's restricted cash balance of $115.0 million at January 31, 2015 was held in a money market account and is not included in the following table. The Company uses a three-tier fair value hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used in the valuation methodologies in measuring fair value:  Level 1. Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. Level 2. Other inputs that are directly or indirectly observable in the marketplace. Level 3. Unobservable inputs which are supported by little or no market activity. The following table presents information about the Companys assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value as of January 31, 2015 and indicates the fair value hierarchy of the valuation (in thousands):  ##TABLE_START Description Quoted Prices in Active Markets for Identical Assets (Level 1)  Significant Other Observable Inputs (Level 2)  Significant Unobservable Inputs (Level 3)  Balances as of January 31, 2015 Cash equivalents (1):        Time deposits $  $ 292,487  $  $ 292,487 Money market mutual funds 13,983    13,983 Marketable securities:        Corporate notes and obligations  608,274   608,274 U.S. treasury securities  73,482   73,482 Mortgage backed obligations  43,925   43,925 Asset backed securities  120,137   120,137 Municipal securities  36,537   36,537 Foreign government obligations  12,301   12,301 U.S. agency obligations  19,510   19,510 Covered bonds  68,001   68,001 Foreign currency derivative contracts (2)  10,611   10,611 Total Assets $ 13,983  $ 1,285,265  $  $ 1,299,248 Liabilities        Foreign currency derivative contracts (3) $  $ 5,694  $  $ 5,694 Total Liabilities $  $ 5,694  $  $ 5,694 ##TABLE_END_____________ (1) Included in cash and cash equivalents in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet as of January 31, 2015 , in addition to $601.6 million of cash.

Derivative Financial Instruments The Company enters into foreign currency derivative contracts with financial institutions to reduce the risk that its cash flows and earnings will be adversely affected by foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. The Company uses forward currency derivative contracts to minimize the Companys exposure to balances primarily denominated in Euros, Japanese yen, Canadian dollars, Australian dollars and British pounds. The Companys foreign currency derivative contracts, which are not designated as hedging instruments, are used to reduce the exchange rate risk associated primarily with intercompany receivables and payables. The Companys derivative financial instruments program is not designated for trading or speculative purposes. As of January 31, 2015 and 2014 , the foreign currency derivative contracts that were not settled were recorded at fair value on the consolidated balance sheets. Foreign currency derivative contracts are marked-to-market at the end of each reporting period with gains and losses recognized as other expense to offset the gains or losses resulting from the settlement or remeasurement of the underlying foreign currency denominated receivables and payables. While the contract or notional amount is often used to express the volume of foreign currency derivative contracts, the amounts potentially subject to credit risk are generally limited to the amounts, if any, by which the counterparties obligations under the agreements exceed the obligations of the Company to the counterparties. Details on outstanding foreign currency derivative contracts related primarily to intercompany receivables and payables are presented below (in thousands):  ##TABLE_START  As of January 31,   Notional amount of foreign currency derivative contracts $ 942,086  $ 563,060 Fair value of foreign currency derivative contracts $ 4,917  $ (203 ) ##TABLE_ENDThe fair value of the Companys outstanding derivative instruments are summarized below (in thousands):  ##TABLE_START   Fair Value of Derivative Instruments   As of January 31,   Balance Sheet Location  Derivative Assets     Derivatives not designated as hedging instruments:     Foreign currency derivative contracts Prepaid expenses and other current assets $ 10,611  $ 1,598 Derivative Liabilities     Derivatives not designated as hedging instruments:     Foreign currency derivative contracts Accounts payable, accrued expenses and other liabilities $ 5,694  $ 1,801 ##TABLE_ENDThe effect of the derivative instruments not designated as hedging instruments on the consolidated statements of operations during fiscal 2015 , 2014 and 2013 , respectively, are summarized below (in thousands):  ##TABLE_START         Derivatives Not Designated as Hedging Instruments Gains (Losses) on Derivative Instruments Recognized in Income     Fiscal Year Ended January 31,  Location    Foreign currency derivative contracts Other income (expense)  $ (1,186 )  $  $ 16,591 ##TABLE_ENDStrategic Investments As of January 31, 2015 , the Company has four investments in marketable equity securities measured using quoted prices in their respective active markets and certain interests in non-marketable equity and debt securities that are collectively considered strategic investments. As of January 31, 2015 , the fair value of the Companys marketable equity securities of $17.8 million includes an unrealized gain of $13.1 million . As of January 31, 2014 , the Company had three investments in marketable equity securities that had a fair value of $15.5 million , which included an unrealized gain of $13.3 million . These investments are recorded at fair value in other assets, net on the consolidated balance sheets. The Companys interest in non-marketable equity and debt securities consists of noncontrolling equity and debt investments in privately-held companies. The Companys investments in these privately-held companies are reported at cost or marked down to fair value when an event or circumstance indicates an other-than-temporary decline in value has occurred. These investments are valued using significant unobservable inputs or data in an inactive market and the valuation requires the Companys judgment due to the absence of market prices and inherent lack of liquidity. As of January 31, 2015 and 2014 , the carrying value of the Companys investments in privately-held companies was $158.0 million and $77.0 million , respectively. These investments are recorded in other assets, net on the consolidated balance sheets. The estimated fair value of the Company's investments in privately-held companies was $280.0 million as of January 31, 2015 . Investment Income Investment income consists of interest income, realized gains, and realized losses on the Companys cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities. The components of investment income are presented below (in thousands):  ##TABLE_START   Fiscal Year Ended January 31,     Interest income  $ 10,129  $ 9,512  $ 17,903 Realized gains   5,952  5,007 Realized losses  (608 )  (5,246 )  (3,348 ) Total investment income $ 10,038  $ 10,218  $ 19,562 ##TABLE_ENDReclassification adjustments out of accumulated other comprehensive loss into net income (loss) were immaterial for fiscal 2015 , 2014 and 2013 , respectively. 3.

In addition to the amounts reflected in the table above, the Company recorded $23.3 million in purchased intangible assets related to perpetual parking rights associated with an existing parking garage situated on the land. The Company capitalized pre-construction activities related to the development of the land, including interest costs and property taxes since the November 2010 purchase. During the first quarter of fiscal 2013 , the Company suspended pre-construction activity. In April 2014 , the Company entered into an agreement to sell 8.8 net acres of the undeveloped real estate and a portion of the perpetual parking rights, for which the Company received a nonrefundable deposit in the amount of $30.0 million . As of January 31, 2015 , these 8.8 net acres and perpetual parking rights met the criteria to be classified as held for sale. As a result, the Company classified this portion of the Company's land and building improvements, which totaled $137.7 million , and the perpetual parking rights of $5.5 million , as held for sale on the accompanying consolidated balance sheet. The sale of this portion of the Company's undeveloped real estate is expected to close within twelve months and is subject to certain closing conditions. As of January 31, 2015 , the fair value of the Company's land, building improvements and perpetual parking rights, based on the expected sale proceeds, exceeds the carrying value. In August 2014 , the Company sold approximately 3.7 net acres of its undeveloped real estate, which had been classified as held for sale, for a total of $72.5 million . The Company recognized a gain of $7.8 million , net of closing costs, on the sale of this portion of the Companys land and building improvements.

The Company recognized a gain of $7.8 million , net of closing costs, on the sale of this portion of the Companys land, building improvements and perpetual parking rights. In November 2014 , the Company entered into an agreement to purchase real property of approximately 817,000 rentable square feet known as 50 Fremont Street, San Francisco, California for approximately $640.0 million . The Company deposited $114.9 million of the proceeds from the sale of the undeveloped real estate described above into a like-kind exchange account for purposes of purchasing the real property. This deposit is classified as restricted cash on the consolidated balance sheet as of January 31, 2015 . The purchase closed in February 2015 (see Note 14 Subsequent Event for details). In December 2012 , the Company entered into a lease agreement for approximately 445,000 rentable square feet of office space at 350 Mission Street in San Francisco, California. The space rented is for the total office space available in the building, which is in the process of being constructed. As a result of the Companys involvement during the construction period, the Company is considered for accounting purposes to be the owner of the construction project. As of January 31, 2015 , the Company had capitalized $125.3 million of construction costs, based on the construction costs incurred to date by the landlord, and recorded a corresponding noncurrent financing obligation liability of $125.3 million . As of January 31, 2014 , the Company had capitalized $40.2 million of construction costs, based on the construction costs incurred to date by the landlord, and recorded a corresponding noncurrent financing obligation liability of $40.2 million . The total expected financing obligation associated with this lease upon completion of the construction of the building, inclusive of the amounts currently recorded, is $335.8 million , including interest (see Note 10 Commitments for future commitment details). The obligation will be settled through monthly lease payments to the landlord once the office space is ready for occupancy.

Debt Convertible Senior Notes ##TABLE_START   Par Value Outstanding  Equity Component Recorded at Issuance  Liability Component of Par Value as of January 31, (In thousands)  0.75% Convertible Senior Notes due January 15, 2015 $  $ 125,530 (1) $  $ 542,159 0.25% Convertible Senior Notes due April 1, 2018 1,150,000  122,421 (2) 1,070,692  1,046,930 ##TABLE_END___________ (1) This amount represents the equity component recorded at the initial issuance of the 0.75% convertible senior notes. (2) This amount represents the equity component recorded at the initial issuance of the 0.25% convertible senior notes. In January 2010, the Company issued at par value $575.0 million of 0.75% convertible senior notes (the  0.75% Senior Notes) due January 15, 2015 unless earlier converted. During the twelve months ended January 31, 2015, the outstanding balance of the 0.75% Senior Notes matured, and the Company repaid $568.9 million in cash of principal balance of the 0.75% Senior Notes. The Company also distributed approximately 17.1 million shares of the Companys common stock to noteholders during the twelve months ended January 31, 2015 , which represents the conversion value in excess of the principal amount. The Company received approximately 17.1 million shares of the Companys common stock from the exercise of the note hedges related to the 0.75% Senior Notes during this same period. The Company recorded a loss of $10.3 million in the twelve months ended January 31, 2015 related to the extinguishment of the 0.75% Senior Notes converted by noteholders. This amount represents the difference between the fair market value allocated to the liability component on the respective settlement dates and the net carrying amount of the liability component and unamortized debt issuance costs on the respective settlement dates. In March 2013, the Company issued at par value $1.15 billion of 0.25% convertible senior notes (the  0.25% Senior Notes) due April 1, 2018 , unless earlier purchased by the Company or converted. Interest is payable semi-annually, in arrears on April 1 and October 1 of each year. The 0.25% Senior Notes are governed by an indenture between the Company, as issuer, and U.S. Bank National Association, as trustee. The 0.25% Senior Notes are unsecured and do not contain any financial covenants or any restrictions on the payment of dividends, the incurrence of senior debt or other indebtedness, or the issuance or repurchase of securities by the Company. If converted, holders of the 0.25% Senior Notes will receive cash equal to the principal amount, and at the Companys election, cash, shares of the Companys common stock, or a combination of cash and shares, for any amounts in excess of the principal amounts. Certain terms of the conversion features of the 0.25% Senior Notes are as follows: ##TABLE_START  Conversion Rate per $1,000 Par Value  Initial Conversion Price per Share  Convertible Date 0.25% Senior Notes 15.0512  $ 66.44  January 1, 2018 ##TABLE_ENDThroughout the term of the 0.25% Senior Notes, the conversion rate may be adjusted upon the occurrence of certain events, including any cash dividends. Holders of the 0.25% Senior Notes will not receive any cash payment representing accrued and unpaid interest upon conversion of a Note. Accrued but unpaid interest will be deemed to be paid in full upon conversion rather than canceled, extinguished or forfeited. Holders may convert the 0.25% Senior Notes under the following circumstances: ##TABLE_START  during any fiscal quarter, if, for at least 20 trading days during the 30 consecutive trading day period ending on the last trading day of the immediately preceding fiscal quarter, the last reported sales price of the Companys common stock for such trading day is greater than or equal to 130% of the applicable conversion price on such trading day share of common stock on such last trading day; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  in certain situations, when the trading price of the 0.25% Senior Notes is less than 98% of the product of the sale price of the Companys common stock and the conversion rate; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  upon the occurrence of specified corporate transactions described under the 0.25% Senior Notes indenture, such as a consolidation, merger or binding share exchange; or ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  at any time on or after the convertible date noted above. ##TABLE_END Holders of the 0.25% Senior Notes have the right to require the Company to purchase with cash all or a portion of the Notes upon the occurrence of a fundamental change, such as a change of control, at a purchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the 0.25% Senior Notes plus accrued and unpaid interest. Following certain corporate transactions that constitute a change of control, the Company will increase the conversion rate for a holder who elects to convert the 0.25% Senior Notes in connection with such change of control. In accounting for the issuances of the 0.25% Senior Notes, the Company separated the 0.25% Senior Notes into liability and equity components. The carrying amount of the liability component was calculated by measuring the fair value of a similar liability that does not have an associated convertible feature. The carrying amount of the equity component representing the conversion option was determined by deducting the fair value of the liability component from the par value of the 0.25% Senior Notes as a whole. The excess of the principal amount of the liability component over its carrying amount (debt discount) is amortized to interest expense over the term of the 0.25% Senior Notes. The equity component is not remeasured as long as it continues to meet the conditions for equity classification. In accounting for the transaction costs related to the 0.25% Senior Notes issuance, the Company allocated the total amount incurred to the liability and equity components based on its relative values. Transaction costs attributable to the liability component are being amortized to expense over the terms of the 0.25% Senior Notes, and transaction costs attributable to the equity component were netted with the equity component in temporary stockholders equity and stockholders equity. The 0.25% Senior Notes and the 0.75% Senior Notes (the Notes), consisted of the following (in thousands):  ##TABLE_START  As of  January 31, 2015  January 31, 2014 Liability component :    Principal:    0.75% Senior Notes (1) $  $ 568,864 0.25% Senior Notes (1) 1,150,000  1,150,000 Less: debt discount, net    0.75% Senior Notes  (26,705 ) 0.25% Senior Notes (2) (79,308 )  (103,070 ) Net carrying amount $ 1,070,692  $ 1,589,089 ##TABLE_END(1) The effective interest rates of the 0.75% Senior Notes and 0.25% Senior Notes are 5.86% and 2.53% , respectively. These interest rates were based on the interest rates of a similar liability at the time of issuance that did not have an associated convertible feature. (2) Included in the consolidated balance sheets within Convertible 0.25% Senior Notes (which is classified as a noncurrent liability) and is amortized over the life of the 0.25% Senior Notes using the effective interest rate method. The total estimated fair values of the Companys 0.25% Senior Notes at January 31, 2015 was $1.3 billion . The fair value was determined based on the closing trading price per $100 of the 0.25% Senior Notes as of the last day of trading for fiscal 2015 . Based on the closing price of the Companys common stock of $56.45 on January 31, 2015 , the if-converted value of the 0.25% Senior Notes was less than their principal amount. Note Hedges To minimize the impact of potential economic dilution upon conversion of the Notes, the Company entered into convertible note hedge transactions with respect to its common stock (the Note Hedges).  ##TABLE_START (in thousands, except for shares) Date  Purchase  Shares 0.75% Note Hedges January 2010  $ 126,500  26,943,812 0.25% Note Hedges March 2013  $ 153,800  17,308,880 ##TABLE_ENDThe Note Hedges cover shares of the Companys common stock at a strike price that corresponds to the initial conversion price of the respective Notes, also subject to adjustment, and are exercisable upon conversion of the Notes. The Note Hedges will expire upon the maturity of the Notes. The Note Hedges are intended to reduce the potential economic dilution upon conversion of the Notes in the event that the market value per share of the Companys common stock, as measured under the Notes, at the time of exercise is greater than the conversion price of the Notes. The Note Hedges are separate transactions and are not part of the terms of the Notes. Holders of the Notes will not have any rights with respect to the Note Hedges. The Note Hedges do not impact earnings per share. As a result of the conversions and maturity of the 0.75% Senior Notes during fiscal 2015 , the Company exercised its rights on the 0.75% Note Hedges and received approximately 17.1 million shares of the Company's common stock during the twelve months ended January 31, 2015 and the 0.75% Note Hedges expired. Warrants ##TABLE_START  Date  Proceeds (in thousands)  Shares  Strike Price 0.75% Warrants January 2010  $ 59,300  26,943,812  $ 29.88 0.25% Warrants March 2013  $ 84,800  17,308,880  $ 90.40 ##TABLE_ENDSeparately, in January 2010 and March 2013, the Company also entered into warrant transactions (the  0.75% Warrants and the  0.25% Warrants, respectively) (collectively, the Warrants), whereby the Company sold warrants to acquire, subject to anti-dilution adjustments, shares of the Companys common stock. The Warrants were anti-dilutive for the periods presented. The Warrants are separate transactions entered into by the Company and are not part of the terms of the Notes or Note Hedges. Holders of the Notes and Note Hedges will not have any rights with respect to the Warrants. In December 2014, the Company entered into agreements with each of the 0.75% Warrant counterparties to amend and settle early the 0.75% Warrants prior to their scheduled expiration beginning in April 2015. As a result of this amendment to settle early with the 0.75% Warrant counterparties, the Company issued, in the aggregate, approximately 13.3 million shares to the counterparties to settle, via a net share settlement, the entirety of the 0.75% Warrants. Term Loan On July 11, 2013, the Company entered into a credit agreement (the Prior Credit Agreement) with Bank of America, N.A. and certain other lenders. The Prior Credit Agreement provided for a $300.0 million term loan (the Term Loan) maturing on July 11, 2016 (the Term Loan Maturity Date), which was entered into in conjunction with and for purposes of funding the acquisition of ExactTarget in fiscal 2014. The Term Loan bore interest at the Companys option at either a base rate plus a spread of 0.50% to 1.00% or an adjusted LIBOR rate as defined in the Prior Credit Agreement plus a spread of 1.50% to 2.00% . The Term Loan was payable in quarterly installments equal to $7.5 million beginning on September 30, 2013, with the remaining outstanding principal amount of the Term Loan being due and payable on the Term Loan Maturity Date. On October 6, 2014, the Company repaid the Term Loan in full and the Prior Credit Agreement was terminated. Revolving Credit Facility On October 6, 2014, the Company entered into an agreement (the Credit Agreement) with Wells Fargo, N.A. and certain other institutional lenders that provides for a $650.0 million unsecured revolving credit facility that matures on October 6, 2019 (the Credit Facility). Immediately upon closing, the Company borrowed $300.0 million under the Credit Facility, approximately $262.5 million of which was used to repay in full the indebtedness under the Company's Term Loan, as described above. Borrowings under the Credit Facility bear interest, at the Companys option at either a base rate, as defined in the Credit Agreement, plus a margin of 0.00% to 0.75% or LIBOR plus a margin of 1.00% to 1.75% . The Company is obligated to pay ongoing commitment fees at a rate between 0.125% and 0.25% . Such interest rate margins and commitment fees are based on the Companys consolidated leverage ratio for the preceding four fiscal quarter periods. Interest and the commitment fees are payable in arrears quarterly. The Company may use amounts borrowed under the Credit Facility for working capital, capital expenditures and other general corporate purposes, including permitted acquisitions. Subject to certain conditions stated in the Credit Agreement, the Company may borrow amounts under the Credit Facility at any time during the term of the Credit Agreement. The Company may also prepay borrowings under the Credit Agreement, in whole or in part, at any time without premium or penalty, subject to certain conditions, and amounts repaid or prepaid may be reborrowed. The Credit Agreement contains certain customary affirmative and negative covenants, including a consolidated leverage ratio covenant, a consolidated interest coverage ratio covenant, a limit on the Companys ability to incur additional indebtedness, dispose of assets, make certain acquisition transactions, pay dividends or distributions, and certain other restrictions on the Companys activities each defined specifically in the Credit Agreement. The Company was in compliance with the Credit Agreements covenants as of January 31, 2015 . The weighted average interest rate on borrowings under the Credit Facility was 1.7% for the period beginning October 6, 2014 and ended January 31, 2015 . As of January 31, 2015 , outstanding borrowings under the Credit Facility were $300.0 million , which is recorded as a noncurrent liability on the accompanying consolidated balance sheet.

Stockholders Equity The Company maintains the following stock plans: the ESPP, the 2013 Equity Incentive Plan and the 2014 Inducement Equity Incentive Plan (the 2014 Inducement Plan). The expiration of the 1999 Stock Option Plan (1999 Plan) in fiscal 2010 did not affect awards outstanding, which continue to be governed by the terms and conditions of the 1999 Plan. On July 10, 2014 , the Company adopted the 2014 Inducement Plan with a reserve of 335,000 shares of common stock for future issuance solely for the granting of inducement stock options and equity awards to new employees, including employees of acquired companies. In addition, approximately 319,000 shares of common stock that remained available for grant under the 2006 Inducement Equity Incentive Plan (the Prior Inducement Plan) as of July 9, 2014 were added to the 2014 Inducement Plan share reserve and the Prior Inducement Plan was terminated. Further, any shares of common stock subject to outstanding awards under the Prior Inducement Plan that expire, are forfeited, or are repurchased by the Company will also become available for future grant under the 2014 Inducement Plan. Termination of the Prior Inducement Plan did not affect the outstanding awards previously issued thereunder. The 2014 Inducement Plan was adopted without stockholder approval in reliance on the employment inducement exemption provided under the New York Stock Exchange Listed Company Manual. In September 2011, the Companys Board of Directors amended and restated the ESPP. In conjunction with the amendment of the ESPP, the Companys Board of Directors determined that the offerings under the ESPP would commence, beginning with a twelve month offering period starting in December 2011. As of January 31, 2015 , $28.7 million has been withheld on behalf of employees for future purchases under the ESPP and is recorded in accounts payable, accrued expenses and other liabilities. Employees purchased 3.3 million shares for $127.8 million and 2.9 million shares for $92.5 million , in fiscal 2015 and 2014 , respectively, under the ESPP. Prior to February 1, 2006, options issued under the Companys stock option plans generally had a term of 10 years. From February 1, 2006 through July 3, 2013, options issued had a term of five years. After July 3, 2013, options issued have a term of seven years.

The expense related to these awards, which was expensed immediately at the time of the issuance, totaled $5.0 million , $4.5 million and $3.8 million for fiscal 2015 , 2014 and 2013 , respectively. Preferred Stock The Companys board of directors has the authority, without further action by stockholders, to issue up to 5,000,000 shares of preferred stock in one or more series. The Companys board of directors may designate the rights, preferences, privileges and restrictions of the preferred stock, including dividend rights, conversion rights, voting rights, terms of redemption, liquidation preference, sinking fund terms, and number of shares constituting any series or the designation of any series. The issuance of preferred stock could have the effect of restricting dividends on the Companys common stock, diluting the voting power of its common stock, impairing the liquidation rights of its common stock, or delaying or preventing a change in control. The ability to issue preferred stock could delay or impede a change in control. As of January 31, 2015 and 2014 , no shares of preferred stock were outstanding. 8.

During fiscal 2013 , the Company established a valuation allowance for a significant portion of its deferred tax assets and recognized a tax expense of $186.8 million . During fiscal 2014 , the Company recorded a partial release of its valuation allowance primarily in connection with the acquisition of ExactTarget. Due to the ExactTarget acquisition, a deferred tax liability was recorded for the book-tax basis difference related to purchased intangibles. The net deferred tax liability from acquisitions provided an additional source of income to support the realizability of the Companys pre-existing deferred tax assets and as a result, the Company released a portion of its valuation allowance and recorded a tax benefit of $143.1 million for fiscal 2014 . In fiscal 2015, the Company recorded income taxes in profitable jurisdictions outside the U.S., which was partially offset by tax benefits from current year losses incurred by ExactTarget in certain state jurisdictions. A reconciliation of income taxes at the statutory federal income tax rate to the provision for (benefit from) income taxes included in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations is as follows (in thousands): ##TABLE_START   Fiscal Year Ended January 31,     U.S. federal taxes at statutory rate  $ (74,580 )  $ (125,277 )  $ (44,729 ) State, net of the federal benefit  (5,332 )  (10,780 )  (969 ) Foreign taxes in excess of the U.S. statutory rate  29,880  33,412  16,931 Change in valuation allowance  100,143  (25,048 )  186,806 Tax credits  (28,056 )  (22,293 )  (17,670 ) Non-deductible expenses  26,224  21,407  4,807 Tax expense/(benefit) from acquisitions  2,341  1,811  (3,568 ) Other, net  (1,017 )  1,008  1,043   $ 49,603  $ (125,760 )  $ 142,651 ##TABLE_ENDIn December 2014, the Tax Increase Prevention Act of 2014 was signed into law, which retroactively renewed expired provisions including research and development tax credits through the end of calendar year 2014. The enacted law change did not impact the Company's tax provision as the retroactive benefit of the research tax credits was fully offset by an increase in valuation allowance. The Company receives certain tax incentives in Switzerland and Singapore in the form of reduced tax rates. The tax reduction program in Switzerland expired in fiscal 2015, and the program in Singapore will expire in fiscal 2016 . Deferred Income Taxes Deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effect of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes. Significant components of the Companys deferred tax assets and liabilities were as follows (in thousands): ##TABLE_START   As of January 31,    Deferred tax assets:     Net operating loss carryforwards  $ 252,858  $ 259,465 Deferred stock-based expense  96,753  82,840 Tax credits  152,715  107,381 Deferred rent expense  58,849  47,063 Accrued liabilities  92,506  79,235 Deferred revenue  15,664  8,522 Basis difference on investment  24,637  11,999 Financing obligation  84,095  63,673 Other  20,017  17,762 Total deferred tax assets  798,094  677,940 Less valuation allowance  (293,097 )  (180,223 ) Deferred tax assets, net of valuation allowance  504,997  497,717 Deferred tax liabilities:     Deferred commissions  (107,197 )  (87,625 ) Purchased intangibles  (213,920 )  (259,409 ) Unrealized gains on investments  (1,793 )  (5,232 ) Depreciation and amortization  (171,908 )  (144,752 ) Other  (3,157 )  (3,599 ) Total deferred tax liabilities  (497,975 )  (500,617 ) Net deferred tax assets  $ 7,022  $ (2,900 ) ##TABLE_ENDAt January 31, 2015 , for federal income tax purposes, the Company had net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $2.1 billion , which expire in fiscal 2021 through fiscal 2035, federal research and development tax credits of approximately $110.6 million , which expire in fiscal 2020 through fiscal 2035, foreign tax credits of approximately $21.5 million , which expire in fiscal 2019 through fiscal 2025, and minimum tax credits of $0.7 million , which have no expiration date. For California income tax purposes, the Company had net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $843.3 million which expire beginning in fiscal 2016 through fiscal 2035, California research and development tax credits of approximately $92.0 million , which do not expire, and $9.5 million of enterprise zone tax credits, which expire in fiscal 2025. For other states income tax purposes, the Company had net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $934.7 million which expire beginning in fiscal 2016 through fiscal 2035 and tax credits of approximately $9.5 million , which expire beginning in fiscal 2021 through fiscal 2025. Utilization of the Companys net operating loss carryforwards may be subject to substantial annual limitation due to the ownership change limitations provided by the Internal Revenue Code and similar state provisions. Such an annual limitation could result in the expiration of the net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards before utilization. The Company regularly assesses the need for a valuation allowance against its deferred tax assets by considering both positive and negative evidence related to the likelihood of the realization of its deferred taxes to determine if it is more-likely-than-not that some or all of its deferred tax assets will be realized. The Company recorded a valuation allowance as it considered its cumulative loss in recent years as a significant piece of negative evidence. During fiscal 2015 , the valuation allowance increased by $112.9 million , primarily due to research tax credits and other US deferred tax assets. The Company will continue to assess the realizability of the deferred tax assets in each of the applicable jurisdictions going forward and adjust the valuation allowance accordingly. The excess tax benefits associated with stock option exercises are recorded directly to stockholders equity only when such benefits are realized following the tax law ordering approach. As a result, the excess tax benefits included in net operating loss carryforwards but are not reflected in deferred tax assets for fiscal 2015 and 2014 are $527.2 million and $408.8 million , respectively. Tax Benefits Related to Stock-Based Expense The total income tax benefit related to stock-based awards was $170.8 million , $147.8 million and $113.9 million for fiscal 2015 , 2014 and 2013 , respectively, the majority of which was not recognized as a result of the valuation allowance. Unrecognized Tax Benefits and Other Considerations The Company records liabilities related to its uncertain tax positions. Tax positions for the Company and its subsidiaries are subject to income tax audits by multiple tax jurisdictions throughout the world. Certain prior year tax returns are currently being examined by various taxing authorities in countries including the United States, Japan, Germany, Swtizerland and the United Kingdom. The Company recognizes the tax benefit of an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the position is sustainable upon examination by the taxing authority, based on the technical merits. The tax benefit recognized is measured as the largest amount of benefit which is greater than 50 percent likely to be realized upon settlement with the taxing authority. The Company had gross unrecognized tax benefits of $ 146.2 million , $ 102.3 million and $ 75.1 million as of January 31, 2015 , 2014 and 2013 respectively. A reconciliation of the beginning and ending balance of total unrecognized tax benefits for fiscal years 2015 , 2014 and 2013 is as follows (in thousands): ##TABLE_START   Fiscal Year Ended January 31,     Balance as of February 1,  $ 102,275  $ 75,144  $ 51,971 Tax positions taken in prior period:      Gross increases  17,938  8,420  7,304 Gross decreases  (1,967 )  (4,466 )  (4,460 ) Tax positions taken in current period:      Gross increases  34,226  27,952  24,401 Settlements    (121 ) Lapse of statute of limitations  (1,224 )  (5,205 )  (4,159 ) Currency translation effect  (5,060 )   Balance as of January 31,  $ 146,188  $ 102,275  $ 75,144 ##TABLE_ENDFor fiscal 2015 , 2014 and 2013 total unrecognized tax benefits in an amount of $44.6 million , $34.9 million and $32.3 million respectively, if recognized, would reduce income tax expense and the Companys effective tax rate after considering the impact of the change in valuation allowance in the U.S. The Company recognizes accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in the income tax provision. The Company accrued penalties and interest in the amount of $1.3 million , $0.6 million and $0.3 million in income tax expense during fiscal 2015 , 2014 and 2013 , respectively. The balance in the non-current income tax payable related to penalties and interest was $4.6 million , $3.3 million and $1.7 million as of January 31, 2015 , 2014 and 2013 , respectively. The Company has operations and taxable presence in multiple jurisdictions in the U.S. and outside of the U.S. Tax positions for the Company and its subsidiaries are subject to income tax audits by multiple tax jurisdictions around the world. The Company currently considers U.S. federal and state, Canada, Japan, Germany, France and the United Kingdom to be major tax jurisdictions. The Companys U.S. federal and state tax returns since February 1999, which was the inception of the Company, remain open to examination. With some exceptions, tax years prior to fiscal 2008 in jurisdictions outside of U.S. are generally closed. However, in Japan and United Kingdom, the Company is no longer subject to examinations for years prior to fiscal 2010 and fiscal 2011, respectively. The Company is currently under audit by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service and California Franchise Tax Board for fiscal 2011 to 2012 and fiscal 2009 to 2010, respectively. Additionally, examinations are conducted in other international jurisdictions, including Japan, Germany, Switzerland and the United Kingdom. The Company regularly evaluates its uncertain tax positions and the likelihood of outcomes from these tax examinations. Significant judgment and estimates are necessary in the determination of income tax reserves. Although it is often difficult to predict the outcomes of tax examinations, the Company believes that it has provided adequate reserves for its income tax uncertainties. In the next twelve months, as some of these ongoing examinations are completed and tax positions in these tax years meet the conditions of being effectively settled, the Company anticipates it is reasonably possible that a decrease of unrecognized tax benefits up to approximately $23 million may occur. 9. Earnings/Loss Per Share Basic earnings/loss per share is computed by dividing net income (loss) by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding for the fiscal period. Diluted earnings/loss per share is computed by giving effect to all potential weighted average dilutive common stock, including options, restricted stock units, warrants and the convertible senior notes. The dilutive effect of outstanding awards and convertible securities is reflected in diluted earnings per share by application of the treasury stock method. Diluted loss per share for fiscal 2015 , 2014 and 2013 are the same as basic loss per share as there is a net loss in these periods and inclusion of potentially issuable shares is anti-dilutive. A reconciliation of the denominator used in the calculation of basic and diluted loss per share is as follows (in thousands):  ##TABLE_START   Fiscal Year Ended January 31,     Numerator:       Net loss  $ (262,688 )  $ (232,175 )  $ (270,445 ) Denominator:       Weighted-average shares outstanding for basic loss per share  624,148  597,613  564,896 Effect of dilutive securities:       Convertible senior notes    Employee stock awards    Warrants    Adjusted weighted-average shares outstanding and assumed conversions for diluted loss per share  624,148  597,613  564,896 ##TABLE_ENDThe weighted-average number of shares outstanding used in the computation of basic and diluted earnings/loss per share does not include the effect of the following potential outstanding common stock.

Commitments Letters of Credit As of January 31, 2015 , the Company had a total of $63.8 million in letters of credit outstanding substantially in favor of certain landlords for office space. These letters of credit renew annually and expire at various dates through December 2030. Leases The Company leases facilities space and certain fixed assets under non-cancelable operating and capital leases with various expiration dates. As of January 31, 2015 , the future minimum lease payments under non-cancelable operating and capital leases are as follows (in thousands):  ##TABLE_START  Capital Leases  Operating Leases  Financing Obligation, Building in Progress-Leased Facility(1) Fiscal Period:      Fiscal 2016 $ 104,825  $ 289,547  $ 1,777 Fiscal 2017 113,982  267,377  16,877 Fiscal 2018 118,259  224,359  21,107 Fiscal 2019 112,807  186,936  21,551 Fiscal 2020 201,471  186,385  21,995 Thereafter  1,124,370  252,517 Total minimum lease payments 651,344  $ 2,278,974  $ 335,824 Less: amount representing interest (84,477 )   Present value of capital lease obligations $ 566,867   ##TABLE_END______________ (1) Total Financing Obligation, Building in Progress-Leased Facility noted above represents the total obligation on the lease agreement noted in Note 3 Property and Equipment and includes $125.3 million that was recorded to Financing obligation, building in progress-leased facility, which is included in Other noncurrent liabilities on the balance sheet. The Companys agreements for the facilities and certain services provide the Company with the option to renew. The Companys future contractual obligations would change if the Company exercised these options. The terms of the lease agreements provide for rental payments on a graduated basis. The Company recognizes rent expense on a straight-line basis over the lease period and has accrued for rent expense incurred but not paid. Of the total operating lease commitment balance of $2.3 billion , approximately $2.0 billion is related to facilities space. The remaining commitment amount is related to computer equipment, other leases, data center capacity and our development and test data center. In April 2014, the Company entered into an office lease agreement to lease approximately 714,000 rentable square feet of an office building located in San Francisco, California that is under construction. The lease payments associated with the lease will be approximately $560.0 million over the 15.5 year term of the lease, beginning in the Company's first quarter of fiscal 2018, which is reflected above under Operating Leases. In February 2015, the Company acquired an office building totaling approximately 817,000 rentable square feet. As of January 31, 2015, approximately 500,000 square feet of the building was being leased by the Company (see Note 14 Subsequent Event). The lease, which was signed in January 2012, is reflected above under Operating Leases, and the commitment totals $238.5 million . The operating lease commitment is as follows: $16.1 million during fiscal 2016; $16.6 million during fiscal 2017; $17.1 million during fiscal 2018; $17.6 million during fiscal 2019; $18.1 million during fiscal 2020; and $153.0 million thereafter. Beginning in the quarter ending April 30, 2015, this commitment will be excluded from future operating lease obligations. Rent expense for fiscal 2015 , 2014 and 2013 was $162.8 million , $123.6 million and $88.3 million , respectively. In December 2014 , the Company entered into an agreement with a third party provider under which the Company will purchase certain infrastructure services for three years . The agreement provides that the Company will pay $33.0 million in fiscal 2016 and $36.0 million in both fiscal 2017 and 2018 for infrastructure services under the agreement. 11. Employee Benefit Plan The Company has a 401(k) plan covering all eligible employees in the United States and Canada. Since January 1, 2006, the Company has been contributing to the plan. Total Company contributions during fiscal 2015 , 2014 and 2013 , were $38.1 million , $27.9 million and $22.1 million , respectively. 12. Legal Proceedings and Claims In the ordinary course of business, the Company is or may be involved in various legal proceedings and claims related to alleged infringement of third-party patents and other intellectual property rights, commercial, corporate and securities, labor and employment, class actions, wage and hour, and other claims. The Company has been, and may in the future be, put on notice and/or sued by third parties for alleged infringement of their proprietary rights, including patent infringement. During fiscal 2015, the Company received a communication from a large technology company alleging that the Company infringed certain of its patents. The Company continues to analyze this claim. No litigation has been filed to date. There can be no assurance that this claim will not lead to litigation in the future. The resolution of this claim is not expected to have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial condition, but it could be material to the net income or cash flows or both of a particular quarter. In general, the resolution of a legal matter could prevent the Company from offering its service to others, could be material to the Companys financial condition or cash flows, or both, or could otherwise adversely affect the Companys operating results. The Company makes a provision for a liability relating to legal matters when it is both probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. These provisions are reviewed at least quarterly and adjusted to reflect the impacts of negotiations, estimated settlements, legal rulings, advice of legal counsel and other information and events pertaining to a particular matter. In managements opinion, resolution of all current matters is not expected to have a material adverse impact on the Companys consolidated results of operations, cash flows or financial position. However, depending on the nature and timing of any such dispute, an unfavorable resolution of a matter could materially affect the Companys future results of operations or cash flows, or both, of a particular quarter. 13. Related-Party Transactions In January 1999, the Salesforce.com Foundation, which recently became a private Foundation, also referred to as the Foundation, was chartered to build philanthropic programs that are focused on youth and technology. Beginning in 2008, Salesforce.org, which is a non-profit mutual benefit corporation, was established to resell the Companys services to nonprofit organizations and certain higher education organizations. The Companys chairman is the chairman of both the Foundation and Salesforce.org. The Companys chairman, one of the Companys employees and one of the Companys board members hold three of the Foundations nine board seats. The Companys chairman and one of the Companys employees hold two of Salesforce.orgs six board seats. The Company does not control the Foundations or Salesforce.org's activities, and accordingly, the Company does not consolidate either of the related entities' statement of activities with its financial results. Since the Foundations inception, the Company has provided at no charge certain resources to Foundation employees such as office space. The value of these items was approximately $1.3 million for fiscal 2015 . Additionally, the Company has donated subscriptions to the Companys service to other qualified non-profit organizations. The Company also allows Salesforce.org to resell the Companys service to non-profit organizations and certain higher education entities. The Company does not charge Salesforce.org for these subscriptions, so revenue from subscriptions provided to non-profit organizations is provided to the Foundation to fund its charitable work. The value of the subscriptions pursuant to reseller agreements was approximately $45.4 million for fiscal 2015 . The Company plans to continue these programs. 14. Subsequent Event In February 2015, the Company acquired 50 Fremont Street, a 41 -story building totaling approximately 817,000 rentable square feet located in San Francisco, California (50 Fremont). The Company acquired 50 Fremont for the purpose of expanding its global headquarters in San Francisco. The acquisition will be accounted for as a business combination. As of January 31, 2015, the Company was leasing approximately 500,000 square feet of the available space in 50 Fremont. Beginning with the fiscal quarter ended April 30, 2015, the Company will include the financial results of 50 Fremont in its condensed consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisition. The total purchase price for 50 Fremont of $629.3 million included $322.6 million in cash, $115.0 million of proceeds from a like-kind exchange account from the sale of the undeveloped real estate described in Note 3 Property and Equipment, and the assumption of a $200.0 million loan secured by 50 Fremont. In connection with the purchase, the Company will recognize a non-cash gain totaling approximately $42.0 million on the termination of the lease signed in January 2012 and the preliminary tax impact is insignificant after considering the impact of the valuation allowance. 15.

CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES ##TABLE_END (a) Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act), as of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K. In designing and evaluating our disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any disclosure controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. In addition, the design of disclosure controls and procedures must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and that management is required to apply its judgment in evaluating the benefits of possible controls and procedures relative to their costs. Based on managements evaluation, our chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are designed to, and are effective to, provide assurance at a reasonable level that the information we are required to disclose in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in Securities and Exchange Commission rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. (b) Managements Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f). Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of January 31, 2015 based on the guidelines established in the Internal ControlIntegrated Framework (2013 framework) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). Our internal control over financial reporting includes policies and procedures that provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external reporting purposes in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Based on the results of our evaluation, our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of January 31, 2015. We reviewed the results of managements assessment with our Audit Committee. The effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of January 31, 2015 has been audited by Ernst  Young LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in its report which is included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. (c) Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting There was no change in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended January 31, 2015 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. (d) Inherent Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls Our management, including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, do not expect that our disclosure controls or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the Company have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty, and that breakdowns can occur because of a simple error or mistake. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people or by management override of the controls. The design of any system of controls is also based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions; over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or the degree of compliance with policies or procedures may deteriorate. Because of the inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected. ##TABLE_START ", "9B": " ITEM 9B.

BUSINESS Overview Salesforce is a leading provider of enterprise cloud computing solutions, with a focus on customer relationship management, or CRM. We introduced our first CRM solution in February 2000, and we have since expanded our service offerings with new editions, solutions, features and platform capabilities. Our mission is to help our customers transform themselves into customer-centric companies by empowering them to connect with their customers in entirely new ways. Our Customer Success Platform, including sales force automation, customer service and support, marketing automation, community management, analytics, application development, Internet of Things integration and our professional cloud services, provide the next-generation platform of enterprise applications, or apps, and services to enable customer success. Our service offerings are intuitive and easy-to-use, can be deployed rapidly, customized easily and integrated with other platforms and enterprise apps. We deliver our solutions as a service via all the major Internet browsers and on leading mobile devices. We sell to businesses of all sizes and in almost every industry worldwide on a subscription basis, primarily through our direct sales efforts and also indirectly through partners. Through our platform and other developer tools, we also encourage third parties to develop additional functionality and new apps that run on our platform, which are sold separately from, or in conjunction with, our services. We were incorporated in Delaware in February 1999. Our principal executive offices are located in San Francisco, California, and our principal website address is www.salesforce.com. Our office address is The Landmark @ One Market, Suite 300, San Francisco, California 94105. The Age of the Customer We believe that the convergence of cloud, social, mobile, data science and Internet of Things technologies is fundamentally transforming how companies sell, service, market and innovate to connect with their customers. Cloud computing has changed the way enterprise business apps are developed and deployed. Organizations no longer need to buy and maintain their own infrastructure of servers, storage and development tools in order to create and run business apps. Instead, companies can gain access to a variety of business apps via an Internet browser or mobile device on an as-needed basis, without the cost and complexity of managing the hardware or software in-house. Social networking has transformed the way people engage and collaborate and is accelerating the adoption of technologies that connect people, products and brands. In addition, the proliferation of mobile phones worldwide continues, and enterprise mobile apps are making it possible for people to conduct business from their phones anytime and anywhere. Progress in data science and machine learning is moving companies beyond just automating business processes to more data-driven, predictive computing solutions. As more people and devices become connected via the Internet of Things, mobile devices and apps, companies are unlocking insights and turning data into meaningful actions to help them to proactively engage one-to-one with customers in real time. By bringing together the power of cloud, social, mobile, data science and Internet of Things technologies in our Customer Success Platform, we believe Salesforce is at the forefront of enabling companies to digitally transform into customer-centric companies. Our Cloud Service Offerings We provide enterprise cloud computing solutions that include apps and platform services, as well as professional services to facilitate the adoption of our solutions. Our service offerings empower companies to grow sales faster; deliver customer service on multiple devices and channels; enable marketers to create one-to-one customer journeys; build branded communities for customers, partners and employees; deliver analytics for every business user; turn data generated by the Internet of Things, or IoT, into meaningful actions; and develop modern mobile and desktop apps quickly and easily. Our service offerings are as follows: Sales Cloud. The Sales Cloud enables companies to store data, monitor leads and progress, forecast opportunities, gain insights through relationship intelligence and collaborate around any sale on desktop and mobile devices. Our customers use the Sales Cloud to grow their sales pipelines, improve sales productivity, simplify complex business processes and close more deals. The Sales Cloud also offers solutions for partner relationship management (including channel management and partner communities) and complete, accurate customer and contact information. Service Cloud. The Service Cloud enables companies to deliver smarter, faster and more personalized customer service and support. Our customers use the Service Cloud to connect their service agents with customers at any time and anywhere, on popular devices and across multiple channels  phone, email, chat, self-service web portals, social networks, online communities and directly within their own products and mobile apps. Marketing Cloud. The Marketing Cloud enables companies to plan, personalize and optimize one-to-one customer interactions. Our customers use the Marketing Cloud to map customer journeys to digital marketing interactions across email, mobile, social, web and connected products. With the Marketing Cloud, customer data can also be integrated with the Sales Cloud and Service Cloud in the form of leads, contacts and customer service cases to give companies a complete view of their customers. Community Cloud. The Community Cloud enables companies to engage directly with groups of people by giving them access to relevant information, apps and experts, creating trusted, branded destinations for customers, partners and employees to collaborate. Analytics Cloud. The Analytics Cloud is an app for business intelligence powered by our Wave platform. It enables companies to quickly deploy sales, service, marketing and custom analytics apps using any data source. Our customers use the Analytics Cloud to enable any employee to quickly and easily explore business data, uncover new insights, make smarter decisions and take action from anywhere on popular mobile devices. IoT Cloud. The IoT Cloud, which we announced in September 2015, connects billions of events from devices, sensors, apps and more from the Internet of Things to Salesforce  enabling companies to take action in a connected world. Our customers use the IoT Cloud to process massive quantities of data, build smarter, more personalized actions and engage proactively with customers in real time. We are currently piloting this new offering with several enterprises. App Cloud. The App Cloud is an app development platform that includes Force, Heroku, Enterprise and Lightning  along with shared identity, data and network services to empower companies to deliver connected apps for any business need. In addition, the App Cloud's platform services include Trailhead, an interactive learning environment for all Salesforce developers, and the AppExchange, Salesforce's enterprise app marketplace. The App Cloud empowers companies with everything they need to build apps quickly, in any language, for any device, and manage them in a single enterprise cloud environment. Professional Cloud Services We offer professional cloud services including consulting, deployment, training, user-centric design and integration to our customers to facilitate faster adoption of our cloud solutions and enable customer success. We also offer architects and innovation program teams that act as advisors to plan and execute digital transformations for our customers, mission critical support, cloud specialists and admin and configuration services that allow our customers to make the best use of our technology. We offer several education service offerings to our customers and partners, ranging from introductory online courses to advanced architecture certifications. With the Trailhead learning platform, our customers and partners have free online access to courses that address topics such as using and administering our services and developing on our platform. For more advanced education, we offer instructor-led and online courses to certify our customers and partners on architecting, administering, deploying and developing our services. In addition, there is a selection of online educational classes available at no charge to customers that subscribe to our customer service plans. Business Benefits of Using Our Solution The key advantages of our solution include: Secure, private, scalable and reliable. Our service has been designed to provide our customers with privacy and high levels of performance, reliability and security. We have built, and continue to invest in, a comprehensive security infrastructure, including firewalls, intrusion detection systems, and encryption for transmissions over the Internet, which we monitor and test on a regular basis. We built and maintain a multi-tenant application architecture that has been designed to enable our service to scale securely, reliably and cost effectively. Our multi-tenant application architecture maintains the integrity and separation of customer data while still permitting all customers to use the same application functionality simultaneously. Rapid deployment and lower total cost of ownership. Our services can be deployed rapidly since our customers do not have to spend time procuring, installing or maintaining the servers, storage, networking equipment, security products or other hardware and software. We enable customers to achieve up-front savings relative to the traditional enterprise software model. Customers benefit from the predictability of their future costs since they generally pay for the service on a per subscriber basis for the term of the subscription contract. Ease of integration and configuration. IT professionals are able to integrate and configure our solutions with existing applications quickly and seamlessly. We provide a set of application programming interfaces (APIs) that enable customers and independent software developers to both integrate our solution with existing third-party, custom and legacy apps and write their own application services that integrate with our solutions. For example, many of our customers use our App Cloud API to move customer-related data from custom-developed and packaged applications into our service on a periodic basis to provide greater visibility into their activities. High levels of user adoption. We have designed our solutions to be intuitive and easy to use. Our solutions contain many tools and features recognizable to users of popular consumer web services, so users have a more familiar user experience than typical enterprise applications. As a result, our users can often use and gain benefit from our solutions with minimal training. We have also designed our solutions to be used on popular mobile devices, making it possible for people to conduct business from their phones. Rapid development of apps and increased innovation. Our customers and third-party developers can create apps rapidly because of the ease of use and the benefits of a multi-tenant platform. We provide the capability for business users to easily customize our applications to suit their specific needs, and also support a variety of programming languages so developers can code complex apps spanning multiple business processes and deliver them via multiple mobile devices. By providing infrastructure and development environments on demand, we provide developers the opportunity to create new and innovative apps without having to invest in hardware. Developers with ideas for a new app can create, test and support their solutions on the App Cloud and make the app accessible for a subscription fee to customers. Continuous innovation. We release hundreds of new features to all of our customers three times a year. Our metadata-driven, multitenant cloud runs on a single code base, which enables every customer to run their business on the latest release without disruption. Because we deploy all upgrades on our servers, new features and functionality automatically become part of our service on the upgrade release date and therefore benefit all of our customers immediately. Positive environmental impact. Our multi-tenant cloud platform makes it possible to use a remarkably small number of servers as efficiently as possible. When organizations move business applications to Salesforce, they can significantly reduce their energy use and carbon footprints compared to traditional on-premises solutions. Our Strategy Our objective is to deliver solutions that transform how companies sell, service, market and innovate to connect with their customers in a whole new way. Not only do we provide enterprise cloud apps, we also provide an enterprise cloud computing platform upon which our customers and partners build and customize their own apps. Key elements of our strategy include: Strengthening our market-leading solutions. We offer multiple editions of our solutions at different price points to meet the needs of customers of different sizes and we have designed our solutions to easily accommodate new features and functionality. We intend to continue to extend all editions of our solutions with new features, functions and increased security through our own development, acquisitions and partnerships. We also provide solutions for certain vertical industries. Expanding strategic relationships with customers. We see significant opportunity to deepen our relationships with our existing customers. As our customers realize the benefits of our services, we aim to upgrade the customer to premium editions and sell more subscriptions by targeting additional functional areas and business units, ultimately becoming our customers' trusted advisors, inspiring enterprise-wide transformation and accelerating strategic engagements, including through direct engagement with the highest levels of our customers' executive management. Extending distribution into new and high-growth product categories. As part of our growth strategy, we are delivering innovative solutions in new categories, including analytics, communities and the Internet of Things. We drive innovation both organically and through acquisitions, such as our February 2016 acquisition of a company that has a next generation quote-to-cash solution delivered 100 percent natively on our platform. Expanding our world-class sales organization. We believe that our offerings provide significant value for businesses of any size. We will continue to pursue businesses of all sizes in top industries and major regions, primarily through our direct sales force. We have steadily increased and plan to continue to increase the number of direct sales professionals we employ, and we intend to develop additional distribution channels for our service. Reducing customer attrition. Our goal is to have all of our customers renew their subscriptions prior to the end of their contractual terms. We run customer success and other related programs in an effort to secure renewals of existing customers. Building our business in top software markets globally, which includes building partnerships that help add customers. We believe that there is a substantial market opportunity for our solutions globally. We plan to continue to aggressively market and sell to customers worldwide via local sales and support professionals with deep expertise in target industries and through partnerships with other enterprise software vendors, ISVs and system integrators. Additionally, we plan to increase the capacity that we are able to offer globally through data centers and third party infrastructure providers. Encouraging the development of third-party applications on our cloud computing platforms. The App Cloud enables existing customers, ISVs and third-party developers to create and deliver cloud-based apps. It is a platform on which apps can be created, tested, published and run. In addition, these apps can be marketed and sold on the AppExchange, our online marketplace for business apps, or sold directly by software vendors. We believe our ecosystem of developers and software vendors will address the business requirements of both current and future customers. Technology, Development and Operations We deliver our Salesforce solutions as highly scalable, cloud computing application and platform services on a multi-tenant technology architecture. Multi-tenancy is an architectural approach that allows us to operate a single application instance for multiple organizations, treating all customers as separate tenants who run in virtual isolation from each other. Customers can use and customize an application as though they each have a separate instance, yet their data and customizations remain secure and insulated from the activities of all other tenants. Our multi-tenant services run on a single stack of hardware and software, which is comprised of commercially available hardware and a combination of proprietary and commercially available software. As a result, we are able to spread the cost of delivering our services across our user base. In addition, because we do not have to manage thousands of distinct applications with their own business logic and database schemas, we believe that we can scale our business faster than traditional software vendors. Moreover, we can focus our resources on building new functionality to deliver to our customer base as a whole rather than on maintaining an infrastructure to support each of their distinct applications. Multi-tenancy also allows for faster bug and security fixes, automatic software updates and the ability to deploy major releases and frequent, incremental improvements to our services, benefiting the entire user community. Our services are optimized to run on specific databases and operating systems using the tools and platforms best suited to serve our customers rather than on-premise software that must be written to the different hardware, operating systems and database platforms existing within a customers unique systems environment. Our developers build and support solutions and features on a single code base on our chosen technology platform. Our efforts are focused on improving and enhancing the features, functionality, performance, availability and security of our existing service offerings as well as developing new features, functionality and services. From time to time, we supplement our internal research and development activities with outside development resources and acquired technology. As part of our business strategy, we periodically acquire companies or technologies, and we incorporate the acquired technologies into our solutions. Performance, functional depth, security and the usability of our solutions influence our technology decisions and product direction. Our customers access our services from any geography over the Internet via all of the major Internet browsers and on most major mobile device operating systems. We provide the majority of our services to our customers from infrastructure operated by us but secured within third-party data center hosting facilities located in the United States and other countries. These third-party data center providers provide space, physical security, continuous power and cooling. The remainder of our services operate from cloud computing platform providers who offer Infrastructure as a Service, including servers, storage, databases and networking. Sources of Revenue We derive our revenues primarily from subscription fees for our service. We also derive revenues from premier support, which provides customers with additional support beyond the standard support that is included in the basic subscription fee. We recognize subscription and support revenue ratably over the contract term, beginning on the commencement date of each contract. The majority of our professional services contracts are on a time and materials basis, for which we generally recognize revenue as the services are rendered. Amounts that have been invoiced are recorded in accounts receivable and in deferred revenue or revenue, depending on whether the revenue recognition criteria have been met. Deferred revenue primarily consists of billings or payments received in advance of revenue recognition from subscription services described above and is recognized as the revenue recognition criteria are met. Unbilled deferred revenue represents future billings under our subscription agreements that have not been invoiced and, accordingly, are not recorded in deferred revenue. We generally invoice customers in annual installments. Deferred revenue and unbilled deferred revenue are influenced by several factors, including new business seasonality within the year, the specific timing, size and duration of large customer subscription agreements, the timing and compounding effects of customer renewals, varying billing cycles of subscription agreements, invoice timing, foreign currency fluctuations and new business linearity within the quarter. Customers We sell to businesses of all sizes and in almost every industry worldwide. The number of paying subscriptions at each of our customers ranges from one to hundreds of thousands. None of our customers accounted for more than five percent of our revenues in fiscal 2016 , 2015 or 2014 . Digital Transactions Our digital transaction volume, representing transactions processed through our solutions and platform, excluding Marketing Cloud and one of our platform service offerings, Heroku, was 976 billion for fiscal 2016, an increase of 67 percent as compared to fiscal 2015. A transaction is a retrieval or update within the Salesforce database, which can be a page load, an information query or an API call, among other things. Our transaction metrics are used to illustrate the growing usage of our service by our customers and to highlight the scalability of our service. We do not believe such transaction metrics are key performance indicators of our financial condition. Specifically, there is no direct correlation between the transaction activity and our financial results, such as our revenue or expense growth and changes in our operating cash flow balances and deferred revenue balances. Additionally, such transaction activity cannot be relied upon as an indicator of future financial performance. Sales, Marketing and Customer Support We organize our sales and marketing programs by geographic regions, including the Americas, Europe and Asia Pacific, which includes Japan. The majority of our revenue from the Americas is attributable to customers in the United States. Approximately 26 percent of our revenue comes from customers outside of the Americas. Strategic Investments Since 2009, we have been investing in early-to-late stage technology and professional cloud service companies across the globe to support our key business initiatives, which include, among other things, extending the capabilities of our platform and CRM offerings, increasing the ecosystem of enterprise cloud companies and partners, accelerating the adoption of cloud technologies and creating the next-generation of mobile applications and connected products. Our minority investments in over 150 companies as of January 31, 2016 also help us stay connected with the pace of innovation that is currently occurring within the technology industry. In some cases, we have acquired companies in which we have previously invested. Because of the inherent risk in investing in early-to-late stage technology companies, our individual investments are subject to a risk of partial or total loss of investment capital. Direct Sales We sell our services primarily through our direct sales force, which is comprised of telephone sales personnel based in regional hubs, and field sales personnel based in territories close to their customers. Both our telephone sales and field sales personnel are supported by sales representatives, who are primarily responsible for generating qualified sales leads. Referral and Indirect Sales We have a network of partners who refer sales leads to us and who then assist in selling to these prospects. This network includes global consulting firms, systems integrators and regional partners. In return, we typically pay these partners a fee based on the first-year subscription revenue generated by the customers whom they refer. Also included in this network are ISVs, whom we typically pay a percentage of the subscription revenue generated by their referrals. We continue to invest in developing additional distribution channels for our subscription service. Marketing Our marketing strategy is to promote our brand and generate demand for our offerings. We use a variety of marketing programs across traditional and social channels to target our prospective and current customers, partners, and developers. Our primary marketing activities include: ##TABLE_START  Press and industry analyst relations to garner third-party validation and generate positive coverage for our company, offerings and value proposition; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  User conferences and events, such as Dreamforce, as well as participation in trade shows and industry events, to create customer and prospect awareness; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Content marketing and engagement on social channels like Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn and YouTube; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Search engine marketing and advertising to drive traffic to our Web properties; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Web site development to engage and educate prospects and generate interest through product information and demonstrations, free trials, case studies, white papers, and marketing collateral; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Multi-channel marketing campaigns; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Customer testimonials; and ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Sales tools and field marketing events to enable our sales organization to more effectively convert leads into customers. ##TABLE_END Customer Service and Support Our global customer support group responds to both business and technical inquiries about the use of our products via the web, telephone, email, social networks and other channels. We provide standard customer support during regular business hours at no charge to customers who purchase any of our paying subscription editions. We also offer premier customer support that is either included in a premium offering or sold for an additional fee, which can include services such as priority access to technical resources, developer support, and system administration. In addition, we offer a mission critical support add-on that is designed to provide customers with responses for incidents from a dedicated team knowledgeable about the customer's specific enterprise architecture, and which offers instruction to optimize their usage of our products. Seasonality Our fourth quarter has historically been our strongest quarter for new business and renewals, and our first quarter is our largest collections and operating cash flow quarter. For a more detailed discussion, see the Seasonal Nature of Deferred Revenue and Accounts Receivable discussion in Managements Discussion and Analysis. Competition The market for our service offerings is highly competitive, rapidly evolving and fragmented, and subject to changing technology and frequent introductions of new products and services. Many prospective customers have invested substantial personnel and financial resources to implement and integrate their current enterprise software into their businesses and therefore may be reluctant or unwilling to migrate away from their current solution to an enterprise cloud computing application service. Additionally, third-party developers may be reluctant to build application services on our platform since they have invested in other competing technology platforms. We compete primarily with generalized platforms and vendors of packaged business software, as well as companies offering enterprise apps, including CRM, collaboration and business intelligence software. We also compete with internally developed apps. We may encounter competition from established enterprise software vendors, as well as start-up and midsized companies focused on disruption, who may develop toolsets and products that allow customers to build new apps that run on the customers current infrastructure or as hosted services. Our current principal competitors include: ##TABLE_START  On-premises offerings from enterprise software application vendors; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Cloud computing application service providers; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Software companies that provide their product or service free of charge, and only charge a premium for advanced features and functionality; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Social media companies; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Traditional platform development environment companies; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Cloud computing development platform companies; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Internally developed applications (by our potential customers information technology (IT) departments); and ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Internet of Things platforms from large companies that have existing relationships with hardware and software companies. ##TABLE_END We believe that as traditional enterprise software application and platform vendors shift more of their focus to cloud computing, they may become a greater competitive threat. Intellectual Property We rely on a combination of trademark, copyright, trade secret and patent laws in the United States and other jurisdictions as well as confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions to protect our proprietary technology and our brands and maintain programs to protect and grow our rights. We also enter into confidentiality and proprietary rights agreements with our employees, consultants and other third parties and control access to software, services, documentation and other proprietary information. We believe the duration of our patents is adequate relative to the expected lives of our service offerings. We also purchase or license technology that we incorporate into our products or services. At times, we make select intellectual property broadly available at no or low cost to achieve a strategic objective, such as promoting industry standards, advancing interoperability, fostering open source software or attracting and enabling our external development community. While it may be necessary in the future to seek or renew licenses relating to various aspects of our products and business methods, we believe, based upon past experience and industry practice, such licenses generally could be obtained on commercially reasonable terms. We believe our continuing research and product development are not materially dependent on any single license or other agreement with a third party relating to the development of our products. Employees As of January 31, 2016, we had more than 19,000 employees. None of our employees in the United States is represented by a labor union, however, for certain foreign subsidiaries, workers councils represent our employees.

RISK FACTORS ##TABLE_END The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones facing us. Other events that we do not currently anticipate or that we currently deem immaterial also may affect our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. Risks Related to Our Business and Industry If our security measures or those of our third-party data center hosting facilities, cloud computing platform providers, or third-party service partners, are breached, and unauthorized access is obtained to a customers data, our data or our IT systems, our services may be perceived as not being secure, customers may curtail or stop using our services, and we may incur significant legal and financial exposure and liabilities. Our services involve the storage and transmission of customers proprietary information, and security breaches could expose us to a risk of loss of this information, litigation and possible liability. While we have security measures in place, they may be breached as a result of third-party action, including intentional misconduct by computer hackers, employee error, malfeasance or otherwise and result in someone obtaining unauthorized access to our IT data, our customers data or our data, including our intellectual property and other confidential business information. Additionally, third parties may attempt to fraudulently induce employees or customers into disclosing sensitive information such as user names, passwords or other information in order to gain access to our customers data, our data or our IT systems. Because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access, or to sabotage systems, change frequently and generally are not recognized until launched against a target, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures. In addition, our customers may authorize third-party technology providers to access their customer data, and some of our customers may not have adequate security measures in place to protect their data that is stored on our services. Because we do not control our customers or third-party technology providers, or the processing of such data by third-party technology providers, we cannot ensure the integrity or security of such transmissions or processing. Malicious third parties may also conduct attacks designed to temporarily deny customers access to our services. Any security breach could result in a loss of confidence in the security of our services, damage our reputation, negatively impact our future sales, disrupt our business and lead to legal liability. Defects or disruptions in our services could diminish demand for our services and subject us to substantial liability. Because our services are complex and incorporate a variety of hardware and proprietary and third-party software, our services may have errors or defects that could result in unanticipated downtime for our subscribers and harm to our reputation and our business. Cloud services frequently contain undetected errors when first introduced or when new versions or enhancements are released. We have from time to time found defects in, and experienced disruptions to, our services and new defects or disruptions may occur in the future. In addition, our customers may use our services in unanticipated ways that may cause a disruption in services for other customers attempting to access their data. As we acquire companies, we may encounter difficulty in incorporating the acquired technologies into our services and maintaining the quality standards that are consistent with our brand and reputation. Since our customers use our services for important aspects of their business, any errors, defects, disruptions in service or other performance problems could hurt our reputation and may damage our customers businesses. As a result, customers could elect to not renew our services or delay or withhold payment to us. We could also lose future sales or customers may make warranty or other claims against us, which could result in an increase in our provision for doubtful accounts, an increase in collection cycles for accounts receivable or the expense and risk of litigation. Interruptions or delays in services from our third-party data center hosting facilities or cloud computing platform providers could impair the delivery of our services and harm our business. We currently serve our customers from third-party data center hosting facilities and cloud computing platform providers located in the United States and other countries. Any damage to, or failure of, our systems generally could result in interruptions in our services. We have from time to time experienced interruptions in our services and such interruptions may occur in the future. Interruptions in our services may reduce our revenue, cause us to issue credits or pay penalties, cause customers to terminate their subscriptions and adversely affect our attrition rates and our ability to attract new customers, all of which would reduce our revenue. Our business would also be harmed if our customers and potential customers believe our services are unreliable. As part of our current disaster recovery and business continuity arrangements, our production environment and all of our customers data are currently replicated in near real-time in a separate facility located elsewhere. Companies and products added through acquisition may be served through alternate facilities. We do not control the operation of any of these facilities, and they may be vulnerable to damage or interruption from earthquakes, floods, fires, power loss, telecommunications failures and similar events. They may also be subject to break-ins, sabotage, intentional acts of vandalism and similar misconduct, as well as local administrative actions, changes to legal or permitting requirements and litigation to stop, limit or delay operation. Despite precautions taken at these facilities, the occurrence of a natural disaster or an act of terrorism, a decision to close the facilities without adequate notice or other unanticipated problems at these facilities could result in lengthy interruptions in our services. Even with disaster recovery and business continuity arrangements, our services could be interrupted. When we add data centers and add capacity, we may move or transfer our data and our customers data. Despite precautions taken during this process, any unsuccessful data transfers may impair the delivery of our services, which may damage our business. Privacy concerns and laws, evolving regulation of cloud computing, cross-border data transfer restrictions and other domestic or foreign regulations may limit the use and adoption of our services and adversely affect our business. Regulation related to the provision of services on the Internet is increasing, as federal, state and foreign governments continue to adopt new laws and regulations addressing data privacy and the collection, processing, storage and use of personal information. In some cases, foreign data privacy laws and regulations, such as the European Unions Data Protection Directive, and the country-specific laws and regulations that implement that directive, also govern the processing of personal information. Further, laws are increasingly aimed at the use of personal information for marketing purposes, such as the European Unions e-Privacy Directive, and the country-specific regulations that implement that directive. Such laws and regulations are subject to new and differing interpretations and may be inconsistent among jurisdictions. These and other requirements could reduce demand for our services or restrict our ability to store and process data or, in some cases, impact our ability to offer our services in certain locations or our customers' ability to deploy our solutions globally. For example, in October 2015, the European Court of Justice invalidated the U.S.-EU Safe Harbor framework that had been in place since 2000, which allowed companies to meet certain European legal requirements for the transfer of personal data from the European Economic Area to the United States. While other adequate legal mechanisms to lawfully transfer such data remain, the invalidation of the U.S.-EU Safe Harbor framework may result in different European data protection regulators applying differing standards for the transfer of personal data, which could result in increased regulation, cost of compliance and limitations on data transfer for Salesforce and its customers. The costs of compliance with and other burdens imposed by laws, regulations and standards may limit the use and adoption of our services, reduce overall demand for our services, lead to significant fines, penalties or liabilities for noncompliance, or slow the pace at which we close sales transactions, any of which could harm our business. In addition to government activity, privacy advocacy and other industry groups have established or may establish new self-regulatory standards that may place additional burdens on us. Our customers expect us to meet voluntary certification or other standards established by third parties, such as TRUSTe. If we are unable to maintain these certifications or meet these standards, it could adversely affect our ability to provide our solutions to certain customers and could harm our business. Furthermore, concerns regarding data privacy may cause our customers customers to resist providing the data necessary to allow our customers to use our services effectively. Even the perception that the privacy of personal information is not satisfactorily protected or does not meet regulatory requirements could inhibit sales of our products or services, and could limit adoption of our cloud-based solutions. Industry-specific regulation and other requirements and standards are evolving and unfavorable industry-specific laws, regulations, interpretive positions or standards could harm our business. Our customers and potential customers conduct business in a variety of industries, including financial services, the public sector, healthcare and telecommunications. Regulators in certain industries have adopted and may in the future adopt regulations or interpretive positions regarding the use of cloud computing and other outsourced services. The costs of compliance with, and other burdens imposed by, industry-specific laws, regulations and interpretive positions may limit our customers use and adoption of our services and reduce overall demand for our services. Compliance with these regulations may also require us to devote greater resources to support certain customers, which may increase costs and lengthen sales cycles. For example, some financial services regulators have imposed guidelines for use of cloud computing services that mandate specific controls or require financial services enterprises to obtain regulatory approval prior to outsourcing certain functions. If we are unable to comply with these guidelines or controls, or if our customers are unable to obtain regulatory approval to use our services where required, our business may be harmed. In addition, an inability to satisfy the standards of certain voluntary third-party certification bodies that our customers may expect, such as an attestation of compliance with the Payment Card Industry (PCI) Data Security Standards, may have an adverse impact on our business and results. Further, there are various statutes, regulations, and rulings relevant to the direct email marketing and text-messaging industries, including the Telephone Consumer Protection Act (TCPA) and related Federal Communication Commission (FCC) orders. The interpretation of many of these statutes, regulations, and rulings is evolving in the courts and administrative agencies and an inability to comply may have an adverse impact on our business and results. If in the future we are unable to achieve or maintain industry-specific certifications or other requirements or standards relevant to our customers, it may harm our business and adversely affect our results. In some cases, industry-specific laws, regulations or interpretive positions may also apply directly to us as a service provider. Any failure or perceived failure by us to comply with such requirements could have an adverse impact on our business.  We rely on third-party computer hardware, software and cloud computing platforms that could cause errors in, or failures of, our services and may be difficult to replace. We rely on computer hardware purchased or leased from, software licensed from, and cloud computing platforms provided by, third parties in order to offer our services, including database software and hardware from a variety of vendors. Any errors or defects in third-party hardware, software or cloud computing platforms could result in errors in, or a failure of, our services, which could harm our business. These hardware, software and cloud computing platforms may not continue to be available at reasonable prices, on commercially reasonable terms or at all. Any loss of the right to use any of these hardware, software or cloud computing platforms could significantly increase our expenses and otherwise result in delays in the provisioning of our services until equivalent technology is either developed by us, or, if available, is identified, obtained through purchase or license and integrated into our services. The market in which we participate is intensely competitive, and if we do not compete effectively, our operating results could be harmed. The market for enterprise applications and platform services is highly competitive, rapidly evolving and fragmented, and subject to changing technology, shifting customer needs and frequent introductions of new products and services. We compete primarily with generalized platforms and vendors of packaged business software, as well as companies offering enterprise apps, including CRM, collaboration and business intelligence software. We also compete with internally developed apps and face competition from enterprise software vendors and online service providers who may develop toolsets and products that allow customers to build new applications that run on the customers current infrastructure or as hosted services. Our current competitors include: ##TABLE_START  on premise offerings from enterprise software application vendors; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  cloud computing application service providers; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  software companies that provide their product or service free of charge, and only charge a premium for advanced features and functionality; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  social media companies; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  traditional platform development environment companies; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  cloud computing development platform companies; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  internally developed applications (by our potential customers' IT departments); and ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Internet of Things platforms from large companies that have existing relationships with hardware and software companies. ##TABLE_END Many of our current and potential competitors enjoy substantial competitive advantages, such as greater name recognition, longer operating histories and larger marketing budgets, as well as substantially greater financial, technical and other resources. In addition, many of our current and potential competitors have established marketing relationships and access to larger customer bases, and have major distribution agreements with consultants, system integrators and resellers. As a result, our competitors may be able to respond more quickly and effectively than we can to new or changing opportunities, technologies, standards or customer requirements. Furthermore, because of these advantages, even if our services are more effective than the products and services that our competitors offer, potential customers might select competitive products and services in lieu of purchasing our services. For all of these reasons, we may not be able to compete successfully against our current and future competitors. We are subject to risks associated with our strategic investments. Other-than-temporary impairments in the value of our investments could negatively impact our financial results. We invest in early-to-late stage companies for strategic reasons and to support key business initiatives, and may not realize a return on our strategic investments. Many such companies generate net losses and the market for their products, services or technologies may be slow to develop, and, therefore, are dependent on the availability of later rounds of financing from banks or investors on favorable terms to continue their operations. The financial success of our investment in any company is typically dependent on a liquidity event, such as a public offering, acquisition or other favorable market event reflecting appreciation to the cost of our initial investment. The capital markets for public offerings and acquisitions are dynamic and the likelihood of liquidity events for the companies we have invested in could significantly worsen. Further, valuations of privately-held companies are inherently complex due to the lack of readily available market data. If we determine that any of our investments in such companies have experienced a decline in value, we may be required to record an other than temporary impairment, which could be material. We have in the past written off the full value of specific investments. Similar situations could occur in the future and negatively impact our financial results. All of our investments are subject to a risk of a partial or total loss of investment capital. As we acquire and invest in companies or technologies, we may not realize the expected business or financial benefits and the acquisitions could prove difficult to integrate, disrupt our business, dilute stockholder value and adversely affect our operating results and the market value of our common stock. As part of our business strategy, we periodically make investments in, or acquisitions of, complementary businesses, joint ventures, services and technologies and intellectual property rights, and we expect that we will continue to make such investments and acquisitions in the future. Acquisitions and investments involve numerous risks, including:  potential failure to achieve the expected benefits of the combination or acquisition;  difficulties in, and the cost of, integrating operations, technologies, services and personnel;  diversion of financial and managerial resources from existing operations; ##TABLE_START  the potential entry into new markets in which we have little or no experience or where competitors may have stronger market positions; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  potential write-offs of acquired assets or investments, and potential financial and credit risks associated with acquired customers; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  potential loss of key employees of the acquired company; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  inability to generate sufficient revenue to offset acquisition or investment costs; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  inability to maintain relationships with customers and partners of the acquired business; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  difficulty of transitioning the acquired technology onto our existing platforms and maintaining the security standards for such technology consistent with our other services; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  potential unknown liabilities associated with the acquired businesses; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  unanticipated expenses related to acquired technology and its integration into our existing technology; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  negative impact to our results of operations because of the depreciation and amortization of amounts related to acquired intangible assets, fixed assets and deferred compensation, and the loss of acquired deferred revenue and unbilled deferred revenue; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  delays in customer purchases due to uncertainty related to any acquisition; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  the need to implement controls, procedures and policies at the acquired company; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  challenges caused by distance, language and cultural differences; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  in the case of foreign acquisitions, the challenges associated with integrating operations across different cultures and languages and any currency and regulatory risks associated with specific countries; and ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  the tax effects of any such acquisitions. ##TABLE_END Any of these risks could harm our business. In addition, if we finance acquisitions by issuing equity or convertible or other debt securities or loans, our existing stockholders may be diluted, or we could face constraints related to the terms of and repayment obligation related to the incurrence of indebtedness that could affect the market price of our common stock. Our quarterly results are likely to fluctuate and our stock price and the value of our common stock could decline substantially. Our quarterly results are likely to fluctuate. For example, our fiscal fourth quarter has historically been our strongest quarter for new business and renewals. The year-over-year compounding effect of this seasonality in billing patterns and overall new business and renewal activity causes the value of invoices that we generate in the fourth quarter to continually increase in proportion to our billings in the other three quarters of our fiscal year. As a result, our fiscal first quarter is our largest collections and operating cash flow quarter. Additionally, some of the important factors that may cause our revenues, operating results and cash flows to fluctuate from quarter to quarter include: ##TABLE_START  our ability to retain and increase sales to existing customers, attract new customers and satisfy our customers requirements; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  the attrition rates for our services; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  the amount and timing of operating costs and capital expenditures related to the operations and expansion of our business; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  changes in deferred revenue and unbilled deferred revenue balances, which are not reflected in the balance sheet, due to seasonality, the compounding effects of renewals, invoice duration, size and timing, new business linearity between quarters and within a quarter and fluctuations due to foreign currency movements; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  changes in foreign currency exchange rates; ##TABLE_END 14 ##TABLE_START  the number of new employees; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  changes in our pricing policies and terms of contracts, whether initiated by us or as a result of competition; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  the cost, timing and management effort for the introduction of new features to our services; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  the costs associated with acquiring new businesses and technologies and the follow-on costs of integration and consolidating the results of acquired businesses; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  the rate of expansion and productivity of our sales force; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  the length of the sales cycle for our services; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  new product and service introductions by our competitors; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  our success in selling our services to large enterprises; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  evolving regulations of cloud computing and cross-border data transfer restrictions and similar regulations; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  variations in the revenue mix of editions of our services; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  technical difficulties or interruptions in our services; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  expenses related to our real estate, our office leases and our data center capacity and expansion; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  changes in interest rates and our mix of investments, which would impact the return on our investments in cash and marketable securities; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  conditions, particularly sudden changes, in the financial markets, which have impacted and may continue to impact the value of and liquidity of our investment portfolio; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  income tax effects; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  our ability to realize benefits from strategic partnerships, acquisition or investments; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  other than temporary impairments in the value of our strategic investments in early-to-late stage privately held companies, which could be material in a particular quarter; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  expenses related to significant, unusual or discrete events, which are recorded in the period in which the events occur; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  general economic conditions, which may adversely affect either our customers ability or willingness to purchase additional subscriptions or upgrade their services, or delay a prospective customer's purchasing decision, reduce the value of new subscription contracts, or affect attrition rates; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  timing of additional investments in our enterprise cloud computing application and platform services and in our consulting services; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  regulatory compliance costs; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  changes in payment terms and the timing of customer payments and payment defaults by customers; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  extraordinary expenses such as litigation or other dispute-related settlement payments; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  the impact of new accounting pronouncements; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  equity issuances, including as consideration in acquisitions or due to the conversion of our outstanding convertible notes at the election of the note holders; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  the timing of stock awards to employees and the related adverse financial statement impact of having to expense those stock awards on a straight-line basis over their vesting schedules; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  the timing of commission, bonus, and other compensation payments to employees; and ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  the timing of payroll and other withholding tax expenses, which are triggered by the payment of bonuses and when employees exercise their vested stock awards. ##TABLE_END Many of these factors are outside of our control, and the occurrence of one or more of them might cause our operating results to vary widely. As such, we believe that historical quarter-to-quarter comparisons of our revenues, operating results, changes in our deferred revenue and unbilled deferred revenue balances and cash flows may not be meaningful and should not be relied upon as an indication of future performance. Additionally, if we fail to meet or exceed the expectations of securities analysts and investors, or if one or more of the securities analysts who cover us adversely change their recommendation regarding our stock, the market price of our common stock could decline. Moreover, our stock price may be based on expectations, estimates and forecasts of our future performance that may be unrealistic or that may not be met. Further, our stock price may fluctuate based on reporting by the financial media, including television, radio and press reports and blogs. If we experience significant fluctuations in our rate of anticipated growth and fail to balance our expenses with our revenue forecasts, our results could be harmed. Due to the pace of change and innovation in enterprise cloud computing services and the unpredictability of future general economic and financial market conditions and the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, we may not be able to accurately forecast our rate of growth. We plan our expense levels and investment on estimates of future revenue and future anticipated rate of growth. We may not be able to adjust our spending appropriately if the addition of new subscriptions or the renewals of existing subscriptions fall short of our expectations. A portion of our expenses may also be fixed in nature for some minimum amount of time, such as with a data center contract or office lease, so it may not be possible to reduce costs in a timely manner or without the payment of fees to exit certain obligations early. As a result, we expect that our revenues, operating results and cash flows may fluctuate significantly on a quarterly basis. Our recent revenue growth rates may not be sustainable and may decline in the future. We believe that historical period-to-period comparisons of our revenues, operating results and cash flows may not be meaningful and should not be relied upon as an indication of future performance. Our efforts to expand our services beyond the CRM market and to develop our existing services in order to keep pace with technological developments may not succeed and may reduce our revenue growth rate and harm our business. We derive substantially all of our revenue from subscriptions to our CRM enterprise cloud computing application services, and we expect this will continue for the foreseeable future. The markets for our Analytics, Communities and Internet of Things Clouds remain relatively new and it is uncertain whether our efforts will ever result in significant revenue for us. Further, the introduction of significant platform changes and upgrades, including our conversion to our new Lightning platform, and introduction of new services beyond the CRM market, may not be successful, and early stage interest and adoption of such new services may not result in long term success or significant revenue for us. Our efforts to expand our services beyond the CRM market may not succeed and may reduce our revenue growth rate. Additionally, if we are unable to develop enhancements to and new features for our existing or new services that keep pace with rapid technological developments, our business will be harmed. The success of enhancements, new features and services depends on several factors, including the timely completion, introduction and market acceptance of the feature, service or enhancement. Failure in this regard may significantly impair our revenue growth. In addition, because our services are designed to operate on a variety of network hardware and software platforms using a standard browser, we will need to continuously modify and enhance our services to keep pace with changes in Internet-related hardware, software, communication, browser and database technologies. We may not be successful in either developing these modifications and enhancements or in bringing them to market timely. Furthermore, uncertainties about the timing and nature of new network platforms or technologies, or modifications to existing platforms or technologies, could increase our research and development or service delivery expenses. Any failure of our services to operate effectively with future network platforms and technologies could reduce the demand for our services, result in customer dissatisfaction and harm our business. Additionally, if we fail to anticipate or identify significant Internet-related and other technology trends and developments early enough, or if we do not devote appropriate resources to adapting to such trends and developments, our business could be harmed. Sales to customers outside the United States expose us to risks inherent in international sales. We sell our services throughout the world and are subject to risks and challenges associated with international business. Historically, sales in Europe and Asia Pacific together have represented approximately 30 percent of our total revenues, and we intend to continue to expand our international sales efforts. The risks and challenges associated with sales to customers outside the United States include: ##TABLE_START  localization of our services, including translation into foreign languages and associated expenses; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  laws and business practices favoring local competitors; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  pressure on the creditworthiness of sovereign nations, particularly in Europe, where we have customers and a balance of our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  liquidity issues or political actions by sovereign nations, which could result in decreased values of these balances; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  foreign currency fluctuations and controls; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  compliance with multiple, conflicting and changing governmental laws and regulations, including employment, tax, privacy, anti-corruption, import/export, antitrust, data transfer, storage and protection, and industry-specific laws and regulations, including rules related to compliance by our third-party resellers; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  regional data privacy laws and other regulatory requirements that apply to outsourced service providers and to the transmission of our customers data across international borders; ##TABLE_END 16 ##TABLE_START  treatment of revenue from international sources and changes to tax codes, including being subject to foreign tax laws and being liable for paying withholding income or other taxes in foreign jurisdictions; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  different pricing environments; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  different or lesser protection of our intellectual property; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  longer accounts receivable payment cycles and other collection difficulties; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  natural disasters, acts of war, terrorism, pandemics or security breaches; and ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  regional economic and political conditions. ##TABLE_END Any of these factors could negatively impact our business and results of operations. Additionally, our international subscription fees are paid either in U.S. dollars or local currency. As a result, fluctuations in the value of the U.S. dollar and foreign currencies may make our services more expensive for international customers, which could harm our business. Because we recognize revenue from subscriptions for our services over the term of the subscription, downturns or upturns in new business may not be immediately reflected in our operating results. We generally recognize revenue from customers ratably over the terms of their subscription agreements, which are typically 12 to 36 months. As a result, most of the revenue we report in each quarter is the result of subscription agreements entered into during previous quarters. Consequently, a decline in new or renewed subscriptions in any one quarter may not be reflected in our revenue results for that quarter. Any such decline, however, will negatively affect our revenue in future quarters. Accordingly, the effect of significant downturns in sales and market acceptance of our services, and potential changes in our attrition rate, may not be fully reflected in our results of operations until future periods. Our subscription model also makes it difficult for us to rapidly increase our revenue through additional sales in any period, as revenue from new customers must be recognized over the applicable subscription term.  If our customers do not renew their subscriptions for our services or reduce the number of paying subscriptions at the time of renewal, our revenue will decline and our business will suffer. If we cannot accurately predict subscription renewals or upgrade rates, we may not meet our revenue targets which may adversely affect the market price of our common stock. Our customers have no obligation to renew their subscriptions for our services after the expiration of their initial subscription period, which is typically 12 to 36 months, and in the normal course of business, some customers have elected not to renew. In addition, our customers may renew for fewer subscriptions, renew for shorter contract lengths, or switch to lower cost offerings of our services. We cannot accurately predict attrition rates given our varied customer base of enterprise and small and medium size business customers and the number of multi-year subscription contracts. Our attrition rates may increase or fluctuate as a result of a number of factors, including customer dissatisfaction with our services, customers spending levels, decreases in the number of users at our customers, pricing increases or changes and deteriorating general economic conditions. Our future success also depends in part on our ability to sell additional features and services, more subscriptions or enhanced editions of our services to our current customers. This may also require increasingly sophisticated and costly sales efforts that are targeted at senior management. Similarly, the rate at which our customers purchase new or enhanced services depends on a number of factors, including general economic conditions and that our customers do not react negatively to any price changes related to these additional features and services. If our efforts to upsell to our customers are not successful our business may suffer. If the market for our technology delivery model and enterprise cloud computing services develops more slowly than we expect, our business could be harmed. Our success depends on the willingness of third-party developers to build applications that are complementary to our services. Without the development of these applications, both current and potential customers may not find our services sufficiently attractive. In addition, for those customers who authorize a third-party technology partner access to their data, we do not provide any warranty related to the functionality, security and integrity of the data transmission or processing. Despite contract provisions to protect us, customers may look to us to support and provide warranties for the third-party applications, which may expose us to potential claims, liabilities and obligations for applications we did not develop or sell, all of which could harm our business. We are exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates that could negatively impact our financial results and cash flows from changes in the value of the U.S. Dollar versus local currencies. We conduct our business in the following locations: United States, Europe, Canada, Asia Pacific and Japan. The expanding global scope of our business exposes us to risk of fluctuations in foreign currency markets. This exposure is the result of selling in multiple currencies, growth in our international investments, including data center expansion, additional headcount in foreign locations, and operating in countries where the functional currency is the local currency. Specifically, our results of operations and cash flows are subject to fluctuations in the following currencies: the Euro, British Pound Sterling, Canadian Dollar, Australian Dollar and Japanese Yen against the U.S. Dollar. These exposures may change over time as business practices evolve and economic conditions change. The fluctuations of currencies in which we conduct business can both increase and decrease our overall revenue and expenses for any given fiscal period. Such volatility, even when it increases our revenues or decreases our expenses, impacts our ability to accurately predict our future results and earnings. Supporting our existing and growing customer base could strain our personnel resources and infrastructure, and if we are unable to scale our operations and increase productivity, we may not be able to successfully implement our business plan. We continue to experience significant growth in our customer base and personnel, which has placed a strain on our management, administrative, operational and financial infrastructure. We anticipate that additional investments in our internal infrastructure, data center capacity, research, customer support and development, and real estate spending will be required to scale our operations and increase productivity, to address the needs of our customers, to further develop and enhance our services, to expand into new geographic areas, and to scale with our overall growth. The additional investments we are making will increase our cost base, which will make it more difficult for us to offset any future revenue shortfalls by reducing expenses in the short term. We regularly upgrade or replace our various software systems. If the implementations of these new applications are delayed, or if we encounter unforeseen problems with our new systems or in migrating away from our existing applications and systems, our operations and our ability to manage our business could be negatively impacted. Our success will depend in part upon the ability of our senior management to manage our projected growth effectively. To do so, we must continue to increase the productivity of our existing employees and to hire, train and manage new employees as needed. To manage the expected domestic and international growth of our operations and personnel, we will need to continue to improve our operational, financial and management controls, our reporting systems and procedures, and our utilization of real estate. If we fail to successfully scale our operations and increase productivity, we will be unable to execute our business plan. As more of our sales efforts are targeted at larger enterprise customers, our sales cycle may become more time-consuming and expensive, we may encounter pricing pressure and implementation and customization challenges, and we may have to delay revenue recognition for some complex transactions, all of which could harm our business and operating results. As we target more of our sales efforts at larger enterprise customers, including governmental entities, we may face greater costs, longer sales cycles, greater competition and less predictability in completing some of our sales. In this market segment, the customers decision to use our services may be an enterprise-wide decision and, if so, these types of sales would require us to provide greater levels of education regarding the use and benefits of our services, as well as education regarding privacy and data protection laws and regulations to prospective customers with international operations. In addition, larger customers and governmental entities may demand more customization, integration services and features. As a result of these factors, these sales opportunities may require us to devote greater sales support and professional services resources to individual customers, driving up costs and time required to complete sales and diverting our own sales and professional services resources to a smaller number of larger transactions, while potentially requiring us to delay revenue recognition on some of these transactions until the technical or implementation requirements have been met. Pricing and packaging strategies for enterprise and other customers for subscriptions to our existing and future service offerings may not be widely accepted by other new or existing customers. Our adoption of such new pricing and packaging strategies may harm our business. For large enterprise customers, professional services may also be performed by a third party or a combination of our own staff and a third party. Our strategy is to work with third parties to increase the breadth of capability and depth of capacity for delivery of these services to our customers. If a customer is not satisfied with the quality of work performed by us or a third party or with the type of services or solutions delivered, then we could incur additional costs to address the situation, the profitability of that work might be impaired, and the customers dissatisfaction with our services could damage our ability to obtain additional work from that customer. In addition, negative publicity related to our customer relationships, regardless of its accuracy, may further damage our business by affecting our ability to compete for new business with current and prospective customers. We have been and may in the future be sued by third parties for various claims including alleged infringement of proprietary rights. We are involved in various legal matters arising from the normal course of business activities. These may include claims, suits, government investigations and other proceedings involving alleged infringement of third-party patents and other intellectual property rights, commercial, corporate and securities, labor and employment, class actions, wage and hour, and other matters. The software and Internet industries are characterized by the existence of a large number of patents, trademarks and copyrights and by frequent litigation based on allegations of infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights. We have received in the past and may receive in the future communications from third parties, including practicing entities and non-practicing entities, claiming that we have infringed their intellectual property rights. In addition, we have been, and may in the future be, sued by third parties for alleged infringement of their claimed proprietary rights. For example, during fiscal 2015, we received a communication from a large technology company alleging that we infringed certain of its patents. While we continue to analyze this claim and no litigation has been filed to date, there can be no assurance that this claim will not lead to litigation in the future. Our technologies may be subject to injunction if they are found to infringe the rights of a third party or we may be required to pay damages, or both. Further, many of our subscription agreements require us to indemnify our customers for third-party intellectual property infringement claims, which would increase the cost to us of an adverse ruling on such a claim. The outcome of any claims or litigation, regardless of the merits, is inherently uncertain. Any claims and lawsuits, and the disposition of such claims and lawsuits, whether through settlement or licensing discussions, or litigation, could be time-consuming and expensive to resolve, divert management attention from executing our business plan, result in efforts to enjoin our activities, lead to attempts on the part of other parties to pursue similar claims and, in the case of intellectual property claims, require us to change our technology, change our business practices, pay monetary damages or enter into short- or long-term royalty or licensing agreements. Any adverse determination related to intellectual property claims or other litigation could prevent us from offering our services to others, could be material to our financial condition or cash flows, or both, or could otherwise adversely affect our operating results. In addition, depending on the nature and timing of any such dispute, an unfavorable resolution of a legal matter could materially affect our future results of operations or cash flows or both of a particular quarter. In addition, our exposure to risks associated with various claims, including the use of intellectual property, may be increased as a result of acquisitions of other companies. For example, we may have a lower level of visibility into the development process with respect to intellectual property or the care taken to safeguard against infringement risks with respect to the acquired company or technology. In addition, third parties may make infringement and similar or related claims after we have acquired technology that had not been asserted prior to our acquisition. Any failure to protect our intellectual property rights could impair our ability to protect our proprietary technology and our brand. If we fail to protect our intellectual property rights adequately, our competitors may gain access to our technology, and our business may be harmed. In addition, defending our intellectual property rights may entail significant expense. Any of our patents, trademarks or other intellectual property rights may be challenged by others or invalidated through administrative process or litigation. While we have some U.S. patents and many U.S. and international patent applications pending, we may be unable to obtain patent protection for the technology covered in our patent applications or the patent protection may not be obtained quickly enough to meet our business needs. In addition, our existing patents and any patents issued in the future may not provide us with competitive advantages, or may be successfully challenged by third parties. Furthermore, legal standards relating to the validity, enforceability and scope of protection of intellectual property rights are uncertain, and we also may face proposals to change the scope of protection for some intellectual property rights in the U.S. Effective patent, trademark, copyright and trade secret protection may not be available to us in every country in which our services are available. The laws of some foreign countries may not be as protective of intellectual property rights as those in the U.S., and mechanisms for enforcement of intellectual property rights may be inadequate. Also, our involvement in standard setting activity or the need to obtain licenses from others may require us to license our intellectual property. Accordingly, despite our efforts, we may be unable to prevent third parties from using our intellectual property. We may be required to spend significant resources to monitor and protect our intellectual property rights and we may conclude that in at least some instances the benefits of protecting our intellectual property rights may be outweighed by the expense. We may initiate claims or litigation against third parties for infringement of our proprietary rights or to establish the validity of our proprietary rights. Any litigation, whether or not it is resolved in our favor, could result in significant expense to us and divert the efforts of our technical and management personnel. Our continued success depends on our ability to maintain and enhance our brands. We believe that the brand identities we have developed have significantly contributed to the success of our business. Maintaining and enhancing the Salesforce brand and our other brands are critical to expanding our base of customers, partners and employees. Our brand strength will depend largely on our ability to remain a technology leader and continue to provide high-quality innovative products, services, and features. In order to maintain and enhance our brands, we may be required to make substantial investments that may later prove to be unsuccessful. In addition, positions the Company takes on social issues may be unpopular with some customers or potential customers, which may impact our ability to attract or retain such customers. If we fail to maintain and enhance our brands, or if we incur excessive expenses in our efforts to do so, our business, operating results and financial condition may be materially and adversely affected. We may lose key members of our management team or development and operations personnel, and may be unable to attract and retain employees we need to support our operations and growth. Our success depends substantially upon the continued services of our executive officers and other key members of management, particularly our Chief Executive Officer. From time to time, there may be changes in our executive management team resulting from the hiring or departure of executives. Such changes in our executive management team may be disruptive to our business. We are also substantially dependent on the continued service of our existing development and operations personnel because of the complexity of our services and technologies. We do not have employment agreements with any of our executive officers, key management, development or operations personnel and they could terminate their employment with us at any time. The loss of one or more of our key employees or groups could seriously harm our business. In the technology industry, there is substantial and continuous competition for engineers with high levels of experience in designing, developing and managing software and Internet-related services, as well as competition for sales executives and operations personnel. We may not be successful in attracting and retaining qualified personnel. We have from time to time experienced, and we expect to continue to experience, difficulty in hiring and retaining highly skilled employees with appropriate qualifications. If we fail to attract new personnel or fail to retain and motivate our current personnel, our business and future growth prospects could be severely harmed. In addition, we believe in the importance of our corporate culture, or Aloha spirit, which fosters dialogue, collaboration, recognition and a sense of family. As our organization grows, we may find it increasingly difficult to maintain the beneficial aspects of our corporate culture. This could negatively impact our future success. Any failure in our delivery of high-quality technical support services may adversely affect our relationships with our customers and our financial results. Our customers depend on our support organization to resolve technical issues relating to our applications. We may be unable to respond quickly enough to accommodate short-term increases in customer demand for support services. Increased customer demand for these services, without corresponding revenues, could increase costs and adversely affect our operating results. In addition, our sales process is highly dependent on our applications and business reputation and on positive recommendations from our existing customers. Any failure to maintain high-quality technical support, or a market perception that we do not maintain high-quality support, could adversely affect our reputation, our ability to sell our enterprise cloud computing solutions to existing and prospective customers, and our business, operating results and financial position. Periodic changes to our sales organization can be disruptive and may reduce our rate of growth. We periodically change and make adjustments to our sales organization in response to market opportunities, competitive threats, management changes, product introductions or enhancements, acquisitions, sales performance, increases in sales headcount, cost levels and other internal and external considerations. Any such future sales organization changes may result in a temporary reduction of productivity, which could negatively affect our rate of growth. In addition, any significant change to the way we structure our compensation of our sales organization may be disruptive and may affect our revenue growth. Unanticipated changes in our effective tax rate and additional tax liabilities may impact our financial results. We are subject to income taxes in the United States and various jurisdictions outside of the United States. Our effective tax rate could fluctuate due to changes in the mix of earnings and losses in countries with differing statutory tax rates. Our tax expense could also be impacted by changes in non-deductible expenses, changes in excess tax benefits related to exercises and vesting of stock-based expense, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities and our ability to utilize them and the applicability of withholding taxes. We are subject to tax examinations in multiple jurisdictions. While we regularly evaluate new information that may change our judgment resulting in recognition, derecognition or change in measurement of a tax position taken, there can be no assurance that the final determination of any examinations will not have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial position. Our tax provision could also be impacted by changes in U.S federal and state or international tax laws applicable to corporate multinationals such as the legislation recently enacted in the United Kingdom and Australia, other fundamental law changes currently being considered by many countries and changes in taxing jurisdictions' administrative interpretations, decisions, policies and positions. Additionally, the Organisation for Economic Co-Operation and Development recently released final guidance covering various topics, including transfer pricing, country-by-country reporting and definitional changes to permanent establishment which could ultimately impact our tax liabilities. We may also be subject to additional tax liabilities due to changes in non-income taxes resulting from changes in federal, state or international tax laws, changes in taxing jurisdictions administrative interpretations, decisions, policies, and positions, results of tax examinations, settlements or judicial decisions, changes in accounting principles, changes to the business operations, including acquisitions, as well as the evaluation of new information that results in a change to a tax position taken in a prior period. Our debt service obligations and operating lease commitments may adversely affect our financial condition and cash flows from operations. We have a high level of debt, including the 0.25% convertible senior notes we issued in March 2013 (the  0.25% Senior Notes) due April 1, 2018, the loan we assumed when we purchased 50 Fremont, and capital lease arrangements. Additionally, we have significant contractual commitments in operating lease arrangements, which are not reflected on our consolidated balance sheets. In addition, we have a financing obligation for a leased facility of which we are deemed the owner for accounting purposes. Finally, we have a revolving credit facility under which we can draw down up to $650.0 million. As of January 31, 2016, we had no outstanding borrowings under this credit facility. Our maintenance of this indebtedness and any additional issuance of indebtedness could: ##TABLE_START  impair our ability to obtain additional financing in the future for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, general corporate or other purposes; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  cause us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flows from operations towards debt service obligations and principal repayments; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  make us more vulnerable to downturns in our business, our industry or the economy in general; and ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  due to limitations within the revolving credit facility covenants, restrict our ability to incur additional indebtedness, grant liens, merge or consolidate, dispose of assets, make investments, make acquisitions, enter into transactions with affiliates, pay dividends or make distributions, repurchase stock and enter into restrictive agreements, as defined in the credit agreement. ##TABLE_END Our ability to meet our expenses and debt obligations will depend on our future performance, which will be affected by financial, business, economic, regulatory and other factors. We will not be able to control many of these factors, such as economic conditions and governmental regulations. Further, our operations may not generate sufficient cash to enable us to service our debt or contractual obligations resulting from our leases. If we fail to make a payment on our debt, we could be in default on such debt. If we are at any time unable to generate sufficient cash flows from operations to service our indebtedness when payment is due, we may be required to attempt to renegotiate the terms of the instruments relating to the indebtedness, seek to refinance all or a portion of the indebtedness or obtain additional financing. There can be no assurance that we would be able to successfully renegotiate such terms, that any such refinancing would be possible or that any additional financing could be obtained on terms that are favorable or acceptable to us. A failure to comply with the covenants and other provisions of our outstanding debt could result in events of default under such instruments, which could permit acceleration of all of our notes and borrowings under our revolving credit facility. Any required repayment of our notes or revolving credit facility as a result of a fundamental change or other acceleration would lower our current cash on hand such that we would not have those funds available for use in our business. The new lease accounting guidance places operating lease activity on our consolidated balance sheet in fiscal 2020, which results in an increase in both our assets and financing obligations. The implementation of this guidance may impact our ability to obtain the necessary financing from financial institutions at commercially viable rates or at all as this new guidance will result in a higher financing obligation on our consolidated balance sheet. Weakened global economic conditions may adversely affect our industry, business and results of operations. Our overall performance depends in part on worldwide economic conditions. The United States and other key international economies have experienced cyclical downturns from time to time in which economic activity was impacted by falling demand for a variety of goods and services, restricted credit, poor liquidity, reduced corporate profitability, volatility in credit, equity and foreign exchange markets, bankruptcies and overall uncertainty with respect to the economy. These conditions affect the rate of information technology spending and could adversely affect our customers ability or willingness to purchase our enterprise cloud computing services, delay prospective customers purchasing decisions, reduce the value or duration of their subscription contracts, or affect attrition rates, all of which could adversely affect our operating results. Natural disasters and other events beyond our control could materially adversely affect us. Natural disasters or other catastrophic events may cause damage or disruption to our operations, international commerce and the global economy, and thus could have a strong negative effect on us. Our business operations are subject to interruption by natural disasters, fire, power shortages, pandemics and other events beyond our control. Although we maintain crisis management and disaster response plans, such events could make it difficult or impossible for us to deliver our services to our customers, and could decrease demand for our services. The majority of our research and development activities, corporate headquarters, information technology systems, and other critical business operations, are located near major seismic faults in the San Francisco Bay Area. Because we do not carry earthquake insurance for direct quake-related losses, with the exception of the building that we own in San Francisco, and significant recovery time could be required to resume operations, our financial condition and operating results could be materially adversely affected in the event of a major earthquake or catastrophic event. Risks Relating to Our Convertible Senior Notes and Our Common Stock The market price of our common stock is likely to be volatile and could subject us to litigation. The trading prices of the securities of technology companies have been highly volatile. Accordingly, the market price of our notes and common stock has been and is likely to continue to be subject to wide fluctuations. Factors affecting the market price of our notes and common stock include: ##TABLE_START  variations in our operating results, earnings per share, cash flows from operating activities, deferred revenue, year-over-year growth rates for individual core service offerings and other financial metrics and non-financial metrics, and how those results compare to analyst expectations; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  variations in, and limitations of, the various financial and other metrics and modeling used by analysts in their research and reports about our business; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  forward-looking guidance to industry and financial analysts related to future revenue and earnings per share; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  changes in the estimates of our operating results or changes in recommendations by securities analysts that elect to follow our common stock; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  announcements of technological innovations, new services or service enhancements, strategic alliances or significant agreements by us or by our competitors; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  announcements by us or by our competitors of mergers or other strategic acquisitions, or rumors of such transactions involving us or our competitors; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  announcements of customer additions and customer cancellations or delays in customer purchases; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  recruitment or departure of key personnel; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  disruptions in our service due to computer hardware, software, network or data center problems; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  the economy as a whole, market conditions in our industry and the industries of our customers; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  trading activity by a limited number of stockholders who together beneficially own a significant portion of our outstanding common stock; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  the issuance of shares of common stock by us, whether in connection with an acquisition, a capital raising transaction or upon conversion of some or all of our outstanding convertible senior notes; and ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  issuance of debt or other convertible securities. ##TABLE_END In addition, if the market for technology stocks or the stock market in general experiences uneven investor confidence, the market price of our notes and common stock could decline for reasons unrelated to our business, operating results or financial condition. The market price of our notes and common stock might also decline in reaction to events that affect other companies within, or outside, our industry even if these events do not directly affect us. Some companies that have experienced volatility in the trading price of their stock have been the subject of securities class action litigation. If we are the subject of such litigation, it could result in substantial costs and a diversion of managements attention and resources. We may issue additional shares of our common stock or instruments convertible into shares of our common stock, including in connection with the conversion of the notes, and thereby materially and adversely affect the market price of our common stock and the trading price of the notes. We are not restricted from issuing additional shares of our common stock or other instruments convertible into, or exchangeable or exercisable for, shares of our common stock during the life of the notes. If we issue additional shares of our common stock or instruments convertible into shares of our common stock, it may materially and adversely affect the market price of our common stock and, in turn, the trading price of the notes. In addition, the conversion of some or all of the notes may dilute the ownership interests of existing holders of our common stock, and any sales in the public market of any shares of our common stock issuable upon such conversion of the notes could adversely affect the prevailing market price of our common stock. In addition, the potential conversion of the notes could depress the market price of our common stock. We may not have the ability to raise the funds necessary to pay the amount of cash due upon conversion of the notes or the fundamental change purchase price due when a holder submits its notes for purchase upon the occurrence of a fundamental change. Upon the occurrence of a fundamental change, holders of the notes may require us to purchase, for cash, all or a portion of their notes. In addition, if a holder converts its notes, we will generally pay such holder an amount of cash before delivering to such holder any shares of our common stock. There can be no assurance that we will have sufficient financial resources, or will be able to arrange financing, to pay the fundamental change purchase price if holders submit their notes for purchase by us upon the occurrence of a fundamental change or to pay the amount of cash due if holders surrender their notes for conversion. In addition, agreements governing any future debt may restrict our ability to make each of the required cash payments even if we have sufficient funds to make them. Furthermore, our ability to purchase the notes or to pay cash upon the conversion of the notes may be limited by law or regulatory authority. If we fail to purchase the notes, to pay interest due on, or to pay the amount of cash due upon conversion, we will be in default under the indenture, which in turn may result in the acceleration of other indebtedness we may then have. If the repayment of the other indebtedness were to be accelerated, we may not have sufficient funds to repay that indebtedness and to purchase the notes or to pay the amount of cash due upon conversion. Our inability to pay for the notes that are tendered for purchase or upon conversion could result in note holders receiving substantially less than the principal amount of the notes, which could harm our reputation, financing opportunities and our business. The fundamental change provisions may delay or prevent an otherwise beneficial takeover attempt of us. The fundamental change purchase rights will allow holders of the notes to require us to purchase all or a portion of their notes upon the occurrence of a fundamental change. The provisions requiring an increase to the conversion rate for conversions in connection with a make-whole fundamental change may, in certain circumstances, delay or prevent a takeover of us and the removal of incumbent management that might otherwise be beneficial to investors.  The convertible note hedges and warrant transactions may affect the trading price of the notes and the market price of our common stock. We entered into privately negotiated convertible note hedge transactions with certain hedge counterparties concurrently with the pricing of the notes. We also entered into privately negotiated warrant transactions with the hedge counterparties. Taken together, the convertible note hedge transactions and the warrant transactions are expected, but not guaranteed, to reduce the potential dilution with respect to our common stock upon conversion of the notes. If, however, the price of our common stock, as measured under the terms of the warrant transactions, exceeds the exercise price of the warrant transactions, the warrant transactions will have a dilutive effect on our earnings per share to the extent that the price of our common stock as measured under the warrant transactions exceeds the strike price of the warrant transactions. The hedge counterparties and their respective affiliates periodically modify their hedge positions from time to time following the pricing of the notes (and are particularly likely to do so during any observation period relating to a conversion of the notes) by entering into or unwinding various over-the-counter derivative transactions with respect to our common stock, or by purchasing or selling shares of our common stock or the notes in privately negotiated transactions or open market transactions. The effect, if any, of these transactions and activities on the market price of our common stock or the trading price of the notes will depend in part on market conditions and cannot be ascertained at this time. Any of these activities, however, could adversely affect the market price of our common stock and the trading price of the notes. We do not make any representation or prediction as to the direction or magnitude of any potential effect that the transactions described above may have on the price of the notes or our common stock. In addition, we do not make any representation that the counterparties to those transactions will engage in these transactions or activities or that these transactions and activities, once commenced, will not be discontinued without notice; the counterparties or their affiliates may choose to engage in, or discontinue engaging in, any of these transactions or activities with or without notice at any time, and their decisions will be in their sole discretion and not within our control. We are subject to counterparty risk with respect to the convertible note hedge transactions. The hedge counterparties are financial institutions or affiliates of financial institutions, and we will be subject to the risk that these hedge counterparties may default under the convertible note hedge transactions. Our exposure to the credit risk of the hedge counterparties will not be secured by any collateral. If one or more of the hedge counterparties to one or more of our convertible note hedge transactions becomes subject to insolvency proceedings, we will become an unsecured creditor in those proceedings with a claim equal to our exposure at the time under those transactions. Our exposure will depend on many factors but, generally, the increase in our exposure will be correlated to the increase in our stock price and the volatility of our stock. In addition, upon a default by one of the hedge counterparties, we may suffer adverse tax consequences and dilution with respect to our common stock. We can provide no assurances as to the financial stability or viability of any of the hedge counterparties. Provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws and Delaware law might discourage, delay or prevent a change of control of our company or changes in our management and, therefore, depress the market price of our common stock. Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that could depress the market price of our common stock by acting to discourage, delay or prevent a change in control of our company or changes in our management that the stockholders of our company may deem advantageous. These provisions among other things: ##TABLE_START  permit the board of directors to establish the number of directors; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  provide that directors may only be removed with the approval of holders of 66 2/3 percent of our outstanding capital stock; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  require super-majority voting to amend some provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  authorize the issuance of blank check preferred stock that our board could use to implement a stockholder rights plan (also known as a poison pill); ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  prohibit the ability of our stockholders to call special meetings of stockholders; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  prohibit stockholder action by written consent, which requires all stockholder actions to be taken at a meeting of our stockholders; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  provide that the board of directors is expressly authorized to make, alter or repeal our bylaws; and ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  establish advance notice requirements for nominations for election to our board or for proposing matters that can be acted upon by stockholders at annual stockholder meetings. ##TABLE_END In addition, Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law may discourage, delay or prevent a change in control of our company. Section 203 imposes certain restrictions on merger, business combinations and other transactions between us and holders of 15 percent or more of our common stock. In addition, the fundamental change purchase rights applicable to the notes, which will allow note holders to require us to purchase all or a portion of their notes upon the occurrence of a fundamental change, and the provisions requiring an increase to the conversion rate for conversions in connection with a make-whole fundamental change may in certain circumstances delay or prevent a takeover of us and the removal of incumbent management that might otherwise be beneficial to investors. ", "1B": " ITEM 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS None. ", "2": " ITEM 2. PROPERTIES As of January 31, 2016 , our executive and principal offices for sales, marketing, professional services and development consist of over 1.4 million square feet of leased and owned property in the San Francisco Bay Area. Of this total, we lease and occupy over 870,000 square feet and own and occupy over 567,000 square feet (out of the approximately 817,000 square feet of total owned space at 50 Fremont Street, San Francisco). We also lease space in various locations throughout the United States for local sales and professional services personnel. Our foreign subsidiaries lease office space in a number of countries in Europe, Canada and Asia Pacific for our international operations, primarily for local sales and professional services personnel. In addition, we have entered into the following commitments for additional office space in the San Francisco Bay Area: In December 2012, we entered into a lease agreement for approximately 445,000 rentable square feet of office space at 350 Mission Street in San Francisco, California. The space rented is for the total office space available in the building, which is in the process of being constructed. As a result of our involvement during the construction period, we are considered for accounting purposes to be the owner of the construction project. We expect to begin occupying this office space beginning in our first quarter of fiscal 2017. We have excluded this square footage from the total leased space in the San Francisco Bay Area stated above. In April 2014, we entered into a lease agreement for approximately 732,000 rentable square feet of under construction office space located in San Francisco, California. The lease payments associated with the lease will be approximately $590.0 million over the 15.5 year term of the lease, beginning in our first quarter of fiscal 2018. We do not currently occupy this property, and we have excluded this square footage from the total leased space in the San Francisco Bay Area stated above. We operate data centers in the U.S., Europe and Asia pursuant to various co-location lease arrangements. We believe that our existing facilities and offices are adequate to meet our current requirements. If we require additional space, we believe that we will be able to obtain such space on acceptable, commercially reasonable terms. ##TABLE_START ", "3": " ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS ##TABLE_END In the ordinary course of business, we are or may be involved in various legal proceedings and claims related to alleged infringement of third-party patents and other intellectual property rights, commercial, corporate and securities, labor and employment, class actions, wage and hour, and other claims. We have been, and may in the future be put on notice or sued by third parties for alleged infringement of their proprietary rights, including patent infringement. In July 2015, we and certain of our current and former directors were named as defendants in a purported shareholder derivative action in the Superior Court for the State of California, County of San Francisco. The plaintiff filed an amended version of this derivative complaint in November 2015. The derivative complaint alleged that excessive compensation was paid to such directors for their service and included allegations of breach of fiduciary duty and unjust enrichment, and sought restitution and disgorgement of a portion of the directors' compensation as well as reform of our equity plan. Because the complaint was derivative in nature, it did not seek monetary damages from us. In February 2016, the parties agreed to dismiss the complaint with prejudice as to the plaintiff and submitted a stipulation to that effect to the Court. In March 2016, the Court entered the order of dismissal. Neither we nor the individual defendants paid any consideration to the plaintiff. During fiscal 2015, we received a communication from a large technology company alleging that we infringed certain of its patents. We continue to analyze this claim and no litigation has been filed to date. There can be no assurance that this claim will not lead to litigation in the future. The resolution of this claim is not expected to have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, but it could be material to operating results or cash flows or both of a particular quarter. We evaluate all claims and lawsuits with respect to their potential merits, our potential defenses and counterclaims, settlement or litigation potential and the expected effect on us. Our technologies may be subject to injunction if they are found to infringe the rights of a third party. In addition, many of our subscription agreements require us to indemnify our customers for third-party intellectual property infringement claims, which could increase the cost to us of an adverse ruling on such a claim. The outcome of any claims or litigation, regardless of the merits, is inherently uncertain. Any claims and other lawsuits, and the disposition of such claims and lawsuits, whether through settlement or litigation, could be time-consuming and expensive to resolve, divert our attention from executing our business plan, result in efforts to enjoin our activities, lead to attempts by third parties to seek similar claims and, in the case of intellectual property claims, require us to change our technology, change our business practices, pay monetary damages or enter into short- or long-term royalty or licensing agreements. In general, the resolution of a legal matter could prevent us from offering our service to others, could be material to our financial condition or cash flows, or both, or could otherwise adversely affect our operating results. We make a provision for a liability relating to legal matters when it is both probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. These provisions are reviewed at least quarterly and adjusted to reflect the impacts of negotiations, estimated settlements, legal rulings, advice of legal counsel and other information and events pertaining to a particular matter. In our opinion, resolution of all current matters is not expected to have a material adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations, cash flows or financial position. However, depending on the nature and timing of any such dispute, an unfavorable resolution of a matter could materially affect our future results of operations or cash flows, or both, of a particular quarter. ##TABLE_START ", "4": " ITEM 4.

We early adopted this standard retrospectively and reclassified all of our current deferred tax assets and liabilities to noncurrent deferred tax assets and liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets for all periods presented. As a result of the reclassifications, certain noncurrent deferred tax liabilities as of January 31, 2015, 2014, 2013, and 2012 were netted with noncurrent deferred tax assets. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (6) Long-term obligations primarily excludes deferred revenue and includes the loan assumed on 50 Fremont, the 0.75% convertible senior notes issued in January 2010, the 0.25% convertible senior notes issued in March 2013, the term loan entered into in July 2013, and the revolving credit facility entered into in October 2014. At January 31, 2015, the 0.75% notes had matured and were no longer outstanding. At January 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, the 0.75% notes were convertible and accordingly were classified as a current liability. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START ", "7": " ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS ##TABLE_END The following discussion contains forward-looking statements, including, without limitation, our expectations and statements regarding our outlook and future revenues, expenses, results of operations, liquidity, plans, strategies and objectives of management and any assumptions underlying any of the foregoing. Our actual results may differ significantly from those projected in the forward-looking statements. Our forward-looking statements and factors that might cause future actual results to differ materially from our recent results or those projected in the forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, those discussed in the section titled Forward-Looking Information and Risk Factors of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Except as required by law, we assume no obligation to update the forward-looking statements or our risk factors for any reason. Overview We are a leading provider of enterprise cloud computing solutions, with a focus on customer relationship management, or CRM. We introduced our first CRM solution in February 2000, and we have since expanded our service offerings with new editions, solutions, features and platform capabilities. Our mission is to help our customers transform themselves into customer-centric companies by empowering them to connect with their customers in entirely new ways. Our Customer Success Platform, including sales force automation, customer service and support, marketing automation, community management, analytics, application development, Internet of Things integration and our professional cloud services, provide the next-generation platform of enterprise applications and services to enable customer success. Key elements of our strategy include: ##TABLE_START  strengthening our market-leading solutions; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  expanding strategic relationships with customers; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  extending distribution into new and high-growth product categories; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  expanding our world-class sales organization; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  reducing customer attrition; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  building our business in top software markets globally, which includes building partnerships that help add customers; and ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  encouraging the development of third-party applications on our cloud computing platforms. ##TABLE_END We believe the factors that will influence our ability to achieve our objectives include: our prospective customers willingness to migrate to enterprise cloud computing services; the availability, performance and security of our service; our ability to continue to release, and gain customer acceptance of, new and improved features; our ability to successfully integrate acquired businesses and technologies; successful customer adoption and utilization of our service; acceptance of our service in markets where we have few customers; the emergence of additional competitors in our market and improved product offerings by existing and new competitors; the location of new data centers; third-party developers willingness to develop applications on our platforms; our ability to attract new personnel and retain and motivate current personnel; and general economic conditions which could affect our customers ability and willingness to purchase our services, delay the customers purchasing decision or affect attrition rates. To address these factors, we will need to, among other things, continue to add substantial numbers of paying subscriptions, upgrade our customers to fully featured versions or arrangements such as an Enterprise License Agreement, provide high quality technical support to our customers, encourage the development of third-party applications on our platforms and continue to focus on retaining customers at the time of renewal. Our plans to invest for future growth include the continuation of the expansion of our data center capacity, the hiring of additional personnel, particularly in direct sales, other customer-related areas and research and development, the expansion of domestic and international selling and marketing activities, specifically in our top markets, continuing to develop our brands, the addition of distribution channels, the upgrade of our service offerings, the development of new services such as the announcement of our Analytics Cloud, Community Cloud, and Internet of Things, or IoT, Cloud, the integration of acquired technologies, the expansion of our Marketing Cloud and App Cloud core service offerings, and the additions to our global infrastructure to support our growth. We also regularly evaluate acquisitions or investment opportunities in complementary businesses, joint ventures, services and technologies and intellectual property rights in an effort to expand our service offerings. We expect to continue to make such investments and acquisitions in the future and we plan to reinvest a significant portion of our incremental revenue in future periods to grow our business and continue our leadership role in the cloud computing industry. As a result of our aggressive growth plans, specifically our hiring plan and acquisition activities, we have incurred significant expenses from equity awards and amortization of purchased intangibles which have resulted in net losses on a U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (\"GAAP\") basis. As we continue with our growth plan, we may continue to have net losses on a GAAP basis in some future quarters. We remained focused on improving operating margins in fiscal 2016 and expect to remain similarly focused in fiscal 2017. Our operating margin for fiscal 2016 was $114.9 million compared to a $145.6 million loss during the same period a year ago. Our typical subscription contract term is 12 to 36 months, although terms range from one to 60 months, so during any fiscal reporting period only a subset of active subscription contracts is eligible for renewal. We calculate our attrition rate as of the end of each month. Our current attrition rate calculation does not include the Marketing Cloud service offerings. Our attrition rate was between eight and nine percent during the fiscal year ended January 31, 2016 , which is favorable compared to the nine to ten percent attrition rate as of January 31, 2015 . We expect our attrition rate to remain in this range as we continue to expand our enterprise business and invest in customer success and related programs. We expect marketing and sales costs, which were 49 percent of our total revenues for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2016 and 51 percent for the same period a year ago, to continue to represent a substantial portion of total revenues in the future as we seek to grow our customer base, sell more products to existing customers, and build greater brand awareness. Fiscal Year Our fiscal year ends on January 31. References to fiscal 2016 , for example, refer to the fiscal year ending January 31, 2016 . Operating Segments We operate as one operating segment. Operating segments are defined as components of an enterprise for which separate financial information is evaluated regularly by the chief operating decision maker, who in our case is the chief executive officer, in deciding how to allocate resources and assess performance. Over the past few years, we have completed several acquisitions. These acquisitions have allowed us to expand our offerings, presence and reach in various market segments of the enterprise cloud computing market. While we have offerings in multiple enterprise cloud computing market segments, our business operates in one operating segment because all of our offerings operate on a single platform and are deployed in an identical way, and  our chief operating decision maker evaluates our financial information and resources and assesses the performance of these resources on a consolidated basis. Since we operate as one operating segment, all required financial segment information can be found in the consolidated financial statements. Sources of Revenues We derive our revenues from two sources: (1) subscription revenues, which are comprised of subscription fees from customers accessing our enterprise cloud computing services and from customers paying for additional support beyond the standard support that is included in the basic subscription fees; and (2) related professional services such as process mapping, project management, implementation services and other revenue. Other revenue consists primarily of training fees. Subscription and support revenues accounted for approximately 93 percent of our total revenues for fiscal 2016 . Subscription revenues are driven primarily by the number of paying subscribers, varying service types, the price of our service and renewals. We define a customer as a separate and distinct buying entity (e.g., a company, a distinct business unit of a large corporation, a partnership, etc.) that has entered into a contract to access our enterprise cloud computing services. We define a subscription as a unique user account purchased by a customer for use by its employees or other customer-authorized users, and we refer to each such user as a subscriber. The number of paying subscriptions at each of our customers ranges from one to hundreds of thousands. None of our customers accounted for more than five percent of our revenues during fiscal 2016 , 2015 or 2014 . Subscription and support revenues are recognized ratably over the contract terms beginning on the commencement dates of each contract. The typical subscription and support term is 12 to 36 months, although terms range from one to 60 months. Our subscription and support contracts are non-cancelable, though customers typically have the right to terminate their contracts for cause if we materially fail to perform. We generally invoice our customers in advance, in annual installments, and typical payment terms provide that our customers pay us within 30 days of invoice. Amounts that have been invoiced are recorded in accounts receivable and in deferred revenue, or in revenue depending on whether the revenue recognition criteria have been met. In general, we collect our billings in advance of the subscription service period. Professional services and other revenues consist of fees associated with consulting and implementation services and training. Our consulting and implementation engagements are typically billed on a time and materials basis. We also offer a number of training classes on implementing, using and administering our service that are billed on a per person, per class basis. Our typical professional services payment terms provide that our customers pay us within 30 days of invoice. In determining whether professional services can be accounted for separately from subscription and support revenues, we consider a number of factors, which are described in Critical Accounting EstimatesRevenue Recognition below. Revenue by Cloud Service Offering We are providing the information below on a supplemental basis to give additional insight into the revenue performance of our individual core service offerings. Subscription and support revenues consisted of the following by core service offering (in millions): ##TABLE_START  Fiscal Year Ended January 31, 2016  Fiscal Year Ended January 31, 2015  Variance- Percent Sales Cloud $ 2,699.0  $ 2,443.0  % Service Cloud 1,817.8  1,320.2  % App Cloud and Other 1,034.7  745.3  % Marketing Cloud 654.1  505.3  % Total $ 6,205.6  $ 5,013.8   ##TABLE_ENDSubscription and support revenues from the Analytics Cloud and Communities Cloud were not significant for fiscal 2016. Since the launch of IoT Cloud in September 2015, we have been piloting this offering with several enterprises. Analytics Cloud revenue is included with App Cloud and Other in the table above. Communities Cloud revenue is included in either Sales Cloud, Service Cloud or App Cloud and Other revenue depending on the primary service offering purchased. In situations where a customer purchases multiple cloud offerings, such as through an Enterprise License Agreement, we allocate the contract value to each core service offering based on the customers estimated product demand plan and the service that was provided at the inception of the contract. We do not update these allocations based on actual product usage during the term of the contract. We have allocated approximately 10 percent of our total subscription and support revenues for fiscal 2016 and 2015 , based on customers estimated product demand plans and these allocated amounts are included in the table above. Additionally, some of our service offerings have similar features and functions. For example, customers may use the Sales Cloud, the Service Cloud or our App Cloud to record account and contact information, which are similar features across these core service offerings. Depending on a customers actual and projected business requirements, more than one core service offering may satisfy the customers current and future needs. We record revenue based on the individual products ordered by a customer, and not according to the customers business requirements and usage. In addition, as we introduce new features and functions within each offering and refine our allocation methodology for changes in our business, we do not expect it to be practical to adjust historical revenue results by core service offering for comparability. Accordingly, comparisons of revenue performance by service offering over time may not be meaningful. Our Sales Cloud service offering is our most widely distributed service offering and has historically been the largest contributor of subscription and support revenues. As a result, Sales Cloud has the most international exposure and foreign exchange rate exposure, relative to the other cloud service offerings. Conversely, revenue for Marketing Cloud is primarily derived from the Americas, with little impact from foreign exchange rate movement. We estimate that for fiscal 2017 , subscription and support revenues from the Sales Cloud service offering will continue to be the largest contributor of subscription and support revenues, and foreign currency will continue to have a more pronounced impact on Sales Cloud subscription and support revenues than revenues from our other cloud service offerings. Seasonal Nature of Deferred Revenue, Accounts Receivable and Operating Cash Flow Deferred revenue primarily consists of billings to customers for our subscription service. Over 90 percent of the value of our billings to customers is for our subscription and support service. We generally invoice our customers in annual cycles. Approximately 80 percent of all subscription and support invoices were issued with annual terms during fiscal 2016 , which is consistent with fiscal 2015. Occasionally, we bill customers for their multi-year contract on a single invoice which results in an increase in noncurrent deferred revenue. We typically issue renewal invoices in advance of the renewal service period, and depending on timing, the initial invoice for the subscription and services contract and the subsequent renewal invoice may occur in different quarters. This may result in an increase in deferred revenue and accounts receivable. There is a disproportionate weighting towards annual billings in the fourth quarter, primarily as a result of large enterprise account buying patterns. Our fourth quarter has historically been our strongest quarter for new business and renewals. The year on year compounding effect of this seasonality in both billing patterns and overall new and renewal business causes the value of invoices that we generate in the fourth quarter for both new business and renewals to increase as a proportion of our total annual billings. Accordingly, because of this billing activity, our first quarter is our largest collections and operating cash flow quarter. The sequential quarterly changes in accounts receivable, related deferred revenue and operating cash flow during the first three quarters of our fiscal year are not necessarily indicative of the billing activity that occurs in the fourth quarter as displayed below (in thousands, except unbilled deferred revenue):  ##TABLE_START  April 30, 2015  July 31, 2015  October 31, 2015  January 31, 2016 Fiscal 2016        Accounts receivable, net $ 926,381  $ 1,067,799  $ 1,060,726  $ 2,496,165 Deferred revenue, current and noncurrent 3,056,820  3,034,991  2,846,510  4,291,553 Operating cash flow (1) 730,857  304,411  117,907  459,410 Unbilled deferred revenue, a non-GAAP measure 6.0 bn  6.2 bn  6.7 bn  7.1 bn ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  April 30, 2014  July 31, 2014  October 31, 2014  January 31, 2015 Fiscal 2015        Accounts receivable, net $ 684,155  $ 834,323  $ 794,590  $ 1,905,506 Deferred revenue, current and noncurrent 2,324,615  2,352,904  2,223,977  3,321,449 Operating cash flow (1) 473,087  245,893  122,511  332,223 Unbilled deferred revenue, a non-GAAP measure 4.8 bn  5.0 bn  5.4 bn  5.7 bn ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  April 30, 2013  July 31, 2013  October 31, 2013  January 31, 2014 Fiscal 2014        Accounts receivable, net $ 502,609  $ 599,543  $ 604,045  $ 1,360,837 Deferred revenue, current and noncurrent 1,733,160  1,789,648  1,734,619  2,522,115 Operating cash flow (1) 283,189  183,183  137,859  271,238 Unbilled deferred revenue, a non-GAAP measure 3.6 bn  3.8 bn  4.2 bn  4.5 bn ##TABLE_END(1) Operating cash flow represents net cash provided by operating activities for the three months ended in the periods stated above.  Unbilled Deferred Revenue, a Non-GAAP Measure The GAAP deferred revenue balance on our consolidated balance sheet does not represent the total contract value of annual or multi-year, non-cancelable subscription agreements. Unbilled deferred revenue is a non-GAAP operational measure that represents future billings under our subscription agreements that have not been invoiced and, accordingly, are not recorded in deferred revenue. Unbilled deferred revenue was approximately $7.1 billion as of January 31, 2016 and approximately $5.7 billion as of January 31, 2015 . Our typical contract length is between 12 and 36 months. We expect that the amount of unbilled deferred revenue will change from quarter to quarter for several reasons, including the specific timing, duration and size of large customer subscription agreements, varying billing cycles of subscription agreements, the specific timing of customer renewals, foreign currency fluctuations, the timing of when unbilled deferred revenue is to be recognized as revenue, and changes in customer financial circumstances. For multi-year subscription agreements billed annually, the associated unbilled deferred revenue is typically high at the beginning of the contract period, zero just prior to renewal, and increases if the agreement is renewed. Low unbilled deferred revenue attributable to a particular subscription agreement is often associated with an impending renewal and may not be an indicator of the likelihood of renewal or future revenue from such customer. Accordingly, we expect that the amount of aggregate unbilled deferred revenue will change from year-to-year depending in part upon the number and dollar amount of subscription agreements at particular stages in their renewal cycle. Such fluctuations are not a reliable indicator of future revenues. Unbilled deferred revenue does not include minimum revenue commitments from indirect sales channels, as we recognize revenue, deferred revenue, and any unbilled deferred revenue upon sell-through to an end user customer. Cost of Revenues and Operating Expenses Cost of Revenues. Cost of subscription and support revenues primarily consists of expenses related to delivering our service and providing support, the costs of data center capacity, depreciation or operating lease expense associated with computer equipment and software, allocated overhead, amortization expense associated with capitalized software related to our services and acquired developed technologies and certain fees paid to various third parties for the use of their technology, services and data. We allocate overhead such as information technology infrastructure, rent and occupancy charges based on headcount. Employee benefit costs and taxes are allocated based upon a percentage of total compensation expense. As such, general overhead expenses are reflected in each cost of revenue and operating expense category. Cost of professional services and other revenues consists primarily of employee-related costs associated with these services, including stock-based expenses, the cost of subcontractors and allocated overhead. The cost of providing professional services is significantly higher as a percentage of the related revenue than for our enterprise cloud computing subscription service due to the direct labor costs and costs of subcontractors. We intend to continue to invest additional resources in our enterprise cloud computing services. For example, we have invested in additional database software and we plan to increase the capacity that we are able to offer globally through data centers and third party infrastructure providers. As we acquire new businesses and technologies, the amortization expense associated with this activity will be included in cost of revenues. Additionally, as we enter into new contracts with third parties for the use of their technology, services or data, or as our sales volume grows, the fees paid to use such technology or services may increase. The timing of these additional expenses will affect our cost of revenues, both in terms of absolute dollars and as a percentage of revenues, in the affected periods. Research and Development . Research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries and related expenses, including stock-based expenses, the costs of our development and test data center and allocated overhead. We continue to focus our research and development efforts on adding new features and services, integrating acquired technologies, increasing the functionality and security and enhancing the ease of use of our enterprise cloud computing services. Our proprietary, scalable and secure multi-tenant architecture enables us to provide all of our customers with a service based on a single version of our application. As a result, we do not have to maintain multiple versions, which enables us to have relatively lower research and development expenses as compared to traditional enterprise software companies. We expect that in the future, research and development expenses will increase in absolute dollars and may increase as a percentage of total revenues as we invest in building the necessary employee and system infrastructure required to support the development of new, and improve existing, technologies and the integration of acquired businesses and technologies. Marketing and Sales. Marketing and sales expenses are our largest cost and consist primarily of salaries and related expenses, including stock-based expenses, for our sales and marketing staff, including commissions, payments to partners, marketing programs and allocated overhead. Marketing programs consist of advertising, events, corporate communications, brand building and product marketing activities. We plan to continue to invest in marketing and sales by expanding our domestic and international selling and marketing activities, building brand awareness, attracting new customers and sponsoring additional marketing events. The timing of these marketing events, such as our annual and largest event, Dreamforce, will affect our marketing costs in a particular quarter. We expect that in the future, marketing and sales expenses will increase in absolute dollars and continue to be our largest cost. General and Administrative. General and administrative expenses consist of salaries and related expenses, including stock-based expenses, for finance and accounting, legal, internal audit, human resources and management information systems personnel, legal costs, professional fees, other corporate expenses and allocated overhead. We expect that in the future, general and administrative expenses will increase in absolute dollars as we invest in our infrastructure and we incur additional employee related costs, professional fees and insurance costs related to the growth of our business and international expansion. We expect general and administrative costs as a percentage of total revenues to either remain flat or decrease for the next several quarters. Stock-Based Expenses. Our cost of revenues and operating expenses include stock-based expenses related to equity plans for employees and non-employee directors. We recognize our stock-based compensation as an expense in the statement of operations based on their fair values and vesting periods. These charges have been significant in the past and we expect that they will increase as our stock price increases, as we acquire more companies, as we hire more employees and seek to retain existing employees. During fiscal 2016 , we recognized stock-based expense of $593.6 million . As of January 31, 2016 , the aggregate stock compensation remaining to be amortized to costs and expenses was $1.6 billion . We expect this stock compensation balance to be amortized as follows: $626.1 million during fiscal 2017 ; $481.0 million during fiscal 2018 ; $340.6 million during fiscal 2019 and $157.1 million during fiscal 2020 . The expected amortization reflects only outstanding stock awards as of January 31, 2016 and assumes no forfeiture activity. We expect to continue to issue stock-based awards to our employees in future periods. Amortization of Purchased Intangibles from Business Combinations . Our cost of revenues and operating expenses include amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets, such as the amortization of the cost associated with an acquired companys research and development efforts, trade names, customer lists and customer relationships. We expect this expense to increase as we acquire more companies. Critical Accounting Estimates Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, costs and expenses, and related disclosures. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates and assumptions. Our actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. We believe that of our significant accounting policies, which are described in Note 1 Summary of Business and Significant Accounting Policies to our consolidated financial statements, the following accounting policies involve a greater degree of judgment and complexity. Accordingly, these are the policies we believe are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our consolidated financial condition and results of operations. Revenue Recognition . We derive our revenues from two sources: (1) subscription revenues, which are comprised of subscription fees from customers accessing our enterprise cloud computing services and from customers purchasing additional support beyond the standard support that is included in the basic subscription fee; and (2) related professional services such as process mapping, project management, implementation services and other revenue. Other revenue consists primarily of training fees. We commence revenue recognition when all of the following conditions are satisfied: ##TABLE_START  there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  the service has been or is being provided to the customer; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  the collection of the fees is reasonably assured; and ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  the amount of fees to be paid by the customer is fixed or determinable. ##TABLE_END Our subscription service arrangements are non-cancelable and do not contain refund-type provisions. Subscription and Support Revenues Subscription and support revenues are recognized ratably over the contract terms beginning on the commencement date of each contract, which is the date our service is made available to customers. Amounts that have been invoiced are recorded in accounts receivable and in deferred revenue or revenue, depending on whether the revenue recognition criteria have been met. Professional Services and Other Revenues The majority of our professional services contracts are on a time and material basis. When these services are not combined with subscription revenues as a single unit of accounting, as discussed below, these revenues are recognized as the services are rendered for time and material contracts, and when the milestones are achieved and accepted by the customer for fixed price contracts. Training revenues are recognized after the services are performed. Multiple Deliverable Arrangements We enter into arrangements with multiple deliverables that generally include multiple subscriptions, premium support, and professional services. If the deliverables have standalone value upon delivery, we account for each deliverable separately. Subscription services have standalone value as such services are often sold separately. In determining whether professional services have standalone value, we consider the following factors for each professional services agreement: availability of the services from other vendors, the nature of the professional services, the timing of when the professional services contract was signed in comparison to the subscription service start date, and the contractual dependence of the subscription service on the customers satisfaction with the professional services work. To date, we have concluded that all of the professional services included in multiple deliverable arrangements executed have standalone value. Multiple deliverables included in an arrangement are separated into different units of accounting and the arrangement consideration is allocated to the identified separate units based on a relative selling price hierarchy. We determine the relative selling price for a deliverable based on its vendor-specific objective evidence of selling price (VSOE), if available, or our best estimate of selling price (BESP), if VSOE is not available. We have determined that third-party evidence (TPE) is not a practical alternative due to differences in our service offerings compared to other parties and the availability of relevant third-party pricing information. The amount of revenue allocated to delivered items is limited by contingent revenue, if any. For certain professional services, we have established VSOE as a consistent number of standalone sales of this deliverable have been priced within a reasonably narrow range. We have not established VSOE for our subscription services due to lack of pricing consistency, the introduction of new services and other factors. Accordingly, we use our BESP to determine the relative selling price. We determined BESP by considering our overall pricing objectives and market conditions. Significant pricing practices taken into consideration include our discounting practices, the size and volume of our transactions, the customer demographic, the geographic area where our services are sold, our price lists, our go-to-market strategy, historical standalone sales and contract prices. The determination of BESP is made through consultation with and approval by management, taking into consideration the go-to-market strategy. As our go-to-market strategies evolve, we may modify our pricing practices in the future, which could result in changes in relative selling prices, including both VSOE and BESP. Deferred Revenue. The deferred revenue balance does not represent the total contract value of annual or multi-year, non-cancelable subscription agreements. Deferred revenue primarily consists of billings or payments received in advance of revenue recognition from subscription services described above and is recognized as the revenue recognition criteria are met. We generally invoice customers in annual installments. The deferred revenue balance is influenced by several factors, including seasonality, the compounding effects of renewals, invoice duration, invoice timing, size and new business linearity within the quarter. Deferred revenue that will be recognized during the succeeding twelve month period is recorded as current deferred revenue and the remaining portion is recorded as noncurrent. Deferred Commissions. We defer commission payments to our direct sales force. The commissions are deferred and amortized to sales expense over the non-cancelable terms of the related subscription contracts with our customers, which are typically 12 to 36 months. The commission payments, which are paid in full the month after the customers service commences, are a direct and incremental cost of the revenue arrangements. The deferred commission amounts are recoverable through the future revenue streams under the non-cancelable customer contracts. We believe this is the preferable method of accounting as the commission charges are so closely related to the revenue from the non-cancelable customer contracts that they should be recorded as an asset and charged to expense over the same period that the subscription revenue is recognized. During fiscal 2016 , we deferred $380.0 million of commission expenditures and we amortized $319.1 million to sales expense. During the same period a year ago, we deferred $320.9 million of commission expenditures and we amortized $257.6 million to sales expense. Deferred commissions on our consolidated balance sheets totaled $449.1 million at January 31, 2016 and $388.2 million at January 31, 2015 . Capitalized Internal-Use Software Costs . We are required to follow the guidance of Accounting Standards Codification 350 (ASC 350), Intangibles- Goodwill and Other in accounting for the cost of computer software developed for internal-use and the accounting for web-based product development costs. ASC 350 requires companies to capitalize qualifying computer software costs, which are incurred during the application development stage, and amortize these costs on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the respective asset. We deliver our enterprise cloud computing solutions as a service via all the major Internet browsers and on leading major mobile device operating systems. As a result of this software as a service delivery model, we believe we have larger capitalized costs as compared to traditional enterprise software companies as they are required to use a different accounting standard. Costs related to preliminary project activities and post implementation activities are expensed as incurred. Internal-use software is amortized on a straight-line basis over its estimated useful life. We evaluate the useful lives of these assets on an annual basis and test for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances occur that could impact the recoverability of these assets. Business Combinations. Accounting for business combinations requires us to make significant estimates and assumptions, especially at the acquisition date with respect to tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed and pre-acquisition contingencies. We use our best estimates and assumptions to accurately assign fair value to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date. Examples of critical estimates in valuing certain of the intangible assets and goodwill we have acquired include but are not limited to: ##TABLE_START  future expected cash flows from subscription and support contracts, professional services contracts, other customer contracts and acquired developed technologies and patents; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  the acquired companys trade name, trademark and existing customer relationship, as well as assumptions about the period of time the acquired trade name and trademark will continue to be used in our offerings; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  uncertain tax positions and tax related valuation allowances assumed; and ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  discount rates. ##TABLE_END Unanticipated events and circumstances may occur that may affect the accuracy or validity of such assumptions, estimates or actual results. Goodwill and Intangibles. We make estimates, assumptions, and judgments when valuing goodwill and other intangible assets in connection with the initial purchase price allocation of an acquired entity, as well as when evaluating the recoverability of our goodwill and other intangible assets on an ongoing basis. These estimates are based upon a number of factors, including historical experience, market conditions, and information obtained from the management of acquired companies. Critical estimates in valuing certain intangible assets include, but are not limited to, historical and projected attrition rates, discount rates, anticipated growth in revenue from the acquired customers and acquired technology, and the expected use of the acquired assets. These factors are also considered in determining the useful life of acquired intangible assets. The amounts and useful lives assigned to identified intangible assets impacts the amount and timing of future amortization expense. Income Taxes. We use the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on temporary differences between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in the consolidated statements of operations in the period that includes the enactment date. At each of the interim financial reporting periods, we compute our tax provision by applying an estimated annual effective tax rate to year to date ordinary income and adjust the provision for discrete tax items recorded in the same period. The estimated annual effective tax rate at each interim period represents the best estimate based on evaluations of possible future transactions and may be subject to subsequent refinement or revision. Our tax positions are subject to income tax audits by multiple tax jurisdictions throughout the world. We recognize the tax benefit of an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the position is sustainable upon examination by the taxing authority, based on the technical merits. The tax benefit recognized is measured as the largest amount of benefit which is greater than 50 percent likely to be realized upon settlement with the taxing authority. We recognize interest accrued and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in our income tax provision. Valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amounts that are more likely than not expected to be realized based on the weighting of positive and negative evidence. Future realization of deferred tax assets ultimately depends on the existence of sufficient taxable income of the appropriate character (for example, ordinary income or capital gain) within the carryback or carryforward periods available under the applicable tax law. We regularly review the deferred tax assets for recoverability based on historical taxable income, projected future taxable income, the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences and tax planning strategies. Our judgment regarding future profitability may change due to many factors, including future market conditions and the ability to successfully execute the business plans and/or tax planning strategies. Should there be a change in the ability to recover deferred tax assets, our income tax provision would increase or decrease in the period in which the assessment is changed. Strategic Investments. We hold strategic investments in marketable equity securities and non-marketable debt and equity securities in which we do not have a controlling interest or significant influence, as defined in Accounting Standards Codification 323 (ASC 323), Investments - Equity Method and Joint Ventures. Marketable equity securities are measured using quoted prices in their respective active markets and non-marketable debt and equity securities are recorded at cost and presented in the consolidated balance sheet. If, based on the terms of our ownership of these marketable and non-marketable securities, we determine that we exercise significant influence on the entity to which these marketable and non-marketable securities relate, we apply the requirements of ASC 323 to account for such investments. We determine the fair value of our marketable equity securities and non-marketable debt and equity securities quarterly for impairment and disclosure purposes; however, the non-marketable debt and equity securities are recorded at fair value only if an impairment is recognized. The measurement of fair value requires significant judgment and includes a qualitative and quantitative analysis of events and circumstances that impact the fair value of the investment. Our assessment of the severity and duration of the impairment and qualitative and quantitative analysis includes the investees financial metrics, the investees products and technologies meeting or exceeding predefined milestones, market acceptance of the product or technology, other competitive products or technology in the market, general market conditions, management and governance structure of the investee, investees liquidity, debt ratios and the rate at which the investee is using its cash, and investees receipt of additional funding at a lower valuation. In determining the estimated fair value of our strategic investments in privately held companies, we utilize the most recent data available to us. Valuations of privately held companies are inherently complex due to the lack of readily available market data. If the fair value of an investment is below our cost, we determine whether the investment is other-than-temporarily impaired based on our qualitative and quantitative analysis, which includes the severity and duration of the impairment. If the investment is considered to be other-than-temporarily impaired, we record the investment at fair value by recognizing an impairment through the income statement and establishing a new cost basis for the investment.

Unbilled deferred revenue represents future billings under our non-cancelable subscription agreements that have not been invoiced and, accordingly, are not recorded in deferred revenue. Fiscal Years Ended January 31, 2016 and 2015  Revenues. ##TABLE_START  Fiscal Year Ended January 31,  Variance (in thousands)   Dollars  Percent Subscription and support $ 6,205,599  $ 5,013,764  $ 1,191,835  24% Professional services and other 461,617  359,822  101,795  28% Total revenues $ 6,667,216  $ 5,373,586  $ 1,293,630  24% ##TABLE_ENDTotal revenues were $6.7 billion for fiscal 2016 , compared to $5.4 billion during the same period a year ago, an increase of $1.3 billion , or 24 percent . On a constant currency basis, total revenues grew 27 percent. Subscription and support revenues were $6.2 billion , or 93 percent of total revenues, for fiscal 2016 , compared to $5.0 billion , or 93 percent of total revenues, during the same period a year ago, an increase of $1.2 billion , or 24 percent . The increase in subscription and support revenues in fiscal 2016 was primarily attributable to volume-driven increases from new business, which includes new customers, upgrades and additional subscriptions from existing customers. Our attrition rate, which is favorable compared to the prior year, also played a role in the increase in subscription and support revenues. We continue to invest in a variety of customer programs and initiatives, which, along with increasing enterprise adoption, have helped improve our attrition rate. Changes in the net price per user per month have not been a significant driver of revenue growth for the periods presented. Professional services and other revenues were $461.6 million , or seven percent of total revenues, for fiscal 2016 , compared to $359.8 million , or seven percent of total revenues, for the same period a year ago, an increase of $101.8 million , or 28 percent . Revenues in Europe and Asia Pacific accounted for $1.8 billion , or 26 percent of total revenues, for fiscal 2016 , compared to $1.5 billion , or 28 percent of total revenues, during the same period a year ago, an increase of $251.2 million , or 17 percent . The increase in revenues on a total dollar basis outside of the Americas was the result of the increasing acceptance of our service, our focus on marketing our services internationally, additional resources and consistent attrition rates as a result of the reasons stated above. Revenues outside of the Americas increased on a total dollar basis in fiscal 2016 despite an overall strengthening of the U.S. dollar, which reduced aggregate international revenues by $170.5 million compared to fiscal 2015. We expect revenues outside of the Americas to continue to be negatively impacted in fiscal 2017 by the strengthening of the U.S. dollar relative to the Euro, British pound, Japanese yen and Australian dollar. Cost of Revenues.  ##TABLE_START   Fiscal Year Ended January 31,  Variance Dollars (in thousands)    Subscription and support  $ 1,188,967  $ 924,638  $ 264,329 Professional services and other  465,581  364,632  100,949 Total cost of revenues  $ 1,654,548  $ 1,289,270  $ 365,278 Percent of total revenues  %  %   ##TABLE_ENDCost of revenues was $1.7 billion , or 25 percent of total revenues, for fiscal 2016 , compared to $1.3 billion , or 24 percent of total revenues, during the same period a year ago, an increase of $365.3 million . The increase in absolute dollars was primarily due to an increase of $127.9 million in employee-related costs, an increase of $15.6 million in stock-based expenses, an increase of $137.2 million in service delivery costs, primarily due to our efforts to increase data center capacity, an increase of $40.6 million in professional and outside services, an increase in depreciation of equipment and an increase in allocated overhead, offset by a decrease of $9.4 million in amortization of purchased intangibles. We have increased our headcount by 34 percent since January 31, 2015 to meet the higher demand for services from our customers. We intend to continue to invest additional resources in our enterprise cloud computing services and data center capacity. Additionally, the amortization of purchased intangible assets may increase as we acquire additional businesses and technologies. We also plan to add additional employees in our professional services group to facilitate the adoption of our services. The timing of these expenses will affect our cost of revenues, both in terms of absolute dollars and as a percentage of revenues in future periods. The cost of professional services and other revenues exceeded the related revenue during fiscal 2016 by $4.0 million as compared to $4.8 million during the same period a year ago. We expect the cost of professional services to continue to exceed revenue from professional services in future fiscal years. We believe that this investment in professional services facilitates the adoption of our service offerings. Research and Development.  ##TABLE_START   Fiscal Year Ended January 31,  Variance Dollars (in thousands)    Research and development  $ 946,300  $ 792,917  $ 153,383 Percent of total revenues  %  %   ##TABLE_ENDResearch and development expenses were $946.3 million , or 14 percent of total revenues, for fiscal 2016 , compared to $792.9 million , or 15 percent of total revenues, during the same period a year ago, an increase of $153.4 million . The increase in absolute dollars was primarily due to an increase of $114.0 million in employee-related costs, an increase of $8.2 million in stock-based expense, an increase of $18.2 million in development and test data center expense, and an increase in allocated overhead. We increased our research and development headcount by 16 percent since January 31, 2015 in order to improve and extend our service offerings and develop new technologies. We expect that research and development expenses will increase in absolute dollars and may increase as a percentage of revenues in future periods as we continue to add employees and invest in technology to support the development of new, and improve existing, technologies and the integration of acquired technologies. Marketing and Sales. ##TABLE_START   Fiscal Year Ended January 31,  Variance Dollars (in thousands)    Marketing and sales  $ 3,239,824  $ 2,757,096  $ 482,728 Percent of total revenues  %  %   ##TABLE_ENDMarketing and sales expenses were $3.2 billion , or 49 percent of total revenues, for fiscal 2016 , compared to $2.8 billion , or 51 percent of total revenues, during the same period a year ago, an increase of $482.7 million . The increase in absolute dollars was primarily due to increases of $304.7 million in employee-related costs, including amortization of deferred commissions, $112.0 million in advertising expense costs, $12.5 million in amortization of purchased intangibles, $2.7 million stock-based expense and $40.4 million in allocated overhead. Our marketing and sales headcount increased by 21 percent since January 31, 2015 . The increase in headcount was primarily attributable to hiring additional sales personnel to focus on adding new customers and increasing penetration within our existing customer base. General and Administrative. ##TABLE_START   Fiscal Year Ended January 31,  Variance Dollars (in thousands)    General and administrative  $ 748,238  $ 679,936  $ 68,302 Percent of total revenues  %  %   ##TABLE_ENDGeneral and administrative expenses were $748.2 million , or 11 percent of total revenues, for fiscal 2016 , compared to $679.9 million , or 13 percent of total revenues, during the same period a year ago, an increase of $68.3 million . The increase was primarily due to an increase of $39.0 million in employee-related costs, an increase of $8.1 million in bad debt expense, an increase of $2.2 million in stock-based expense and an increase in professional and outside services. Our general and administrative headcount increased by 16 percent since January 31, 2015 as we added personnel to support our growth. Operating lease termination resulting from purchase of 50 Fremont. ##TABLE_START  Fiscal Year Ended January 31,  Variance Dollars (in thousands)   Operating lease termination resulting from purchase of 50 Fremont $ (36,617 )  $  (36,617 ) Percent of total revenues (1 )%  %   ##TABLE_ENDOperating lease termination resulting from purchase of 50 Fremont for fiscal 2016 was $36.6 million .

Income (loss) from operations. ##TABLE_START   Fiscal Year Ended January 31,  Variance Dollars (in thousands)    Income (loss) from operations  $ 114,923  $ (145,633 )  $ 260,556 Percent of total revenues  %  (3 )%   ##TABLE_ENDIncome (loss) from operations for fiscal 2016 was $114.9 million and included $593.6 million of stock-based expenses and $158.1 million of amortization of purchased intangibles. During the same period a year ago, loss from operations was $145.6 million and included $564.8 million of stock-based expenses and $155.0 million of amortization of purchased intangibles. The increase in income from operations is primarily due to a higher revenue growth rate compared to the operating expense growth rate. Investment income. ##TABLE_START   Fiscal Year Ended January 31,  Variance Dollars (in thousands)    Investment income  $ 15,341  $ 10,038  $ 5,303 ##TABLE_ENDInvestment income consists of income on our cash and marketable securities balances. Investment income was $15.3 million for fiscal 2016 and was $10.0 million during the same period a year ago. The increase was primarily due to the increase in cash, cash equivalent and marketable securities balances. Interest expense. ##TABLE_START   Fiscal Year Ended January 31,  Variance Dollars (in thousands)    Interest expense  $ (72,485 )  $ (73,237 )  $ Percent of total revenues  (1 )%  (1 )%   ##TABLE_ENDInterest expense consists of interest on our convertible senior notes, capital leases, term loan and revolving credit facility. Interest expense, net of interest costs capitalized, was $72.5 million for fiscal 2016 and was $73.2 million during the same period a year ago. The decrease was primarily due to the payment of our revolving credit facility in 2015. Other expense. ##TABLE_START   Fiscal Year Ended January 31,  Variance Dollars (in thousands)    Other expense  $ (15,292 )  $ (19,878 )  $ 4,586 ##TABLE_ENDOther expense primarily consists of non-operating costs such as strategic investments fair market adjustments, foreign exchange rate fluctuations, real estate transactions and losses on derecognition of debt. The decrease in other expense for fiscal 2016 was primarily due to losses totaling $ 10.3 million related to the extinguishment of the 0.75% Senior Notes converted by noteholders in fiscal 2015. Gain on sales of land and building improvements. ##TABLE_START   Fiscal Year Ended January 31,  Variance Dollars (in thousands)    Gain on sales of land and building improvements  $ 21,792  $ 15,625  $ 6,167 ##TABLE_ENDGain on sales of land and building improvements consists of the gain the company recognized from sales of undeveloped real estate and a portion of associated perpetual parking rights in San Francisco, California. Gain on sales of land and building improvements, net of closing costs, was $21.8 million for fiscal 2016 and was $15.6 million during the same period a year ago. Provision for income taxes. ##TABLE_START   Fiscal Year Ended January 31,  Variance Dollars (in thousands)    Provision for income taxes  $ (111,705 )  $ (49,603 )  $ (62,102 ) Effective tax rate  %  (23 )%   ##TABLE_ENDWe reported a tax provision of $111.7 million on a pretax income of $64.3 million , which resulted in an effective tax rate of 174 percent for the fiscal 2016 . We had a tax provision in profitable jurisdictions outside the United States and current tax expense in the United States. We had U.S. current tax expense as a result of taxable income before considering certain excess tax benefits from stock options and vesting of restricted stock. We recorded a tax provision of $49.6 million with a pretax loss of $213.1 million , which resulted in an negative effective tax rate of 23 percent for fiscal 2015 . We had a tax provision primarily due to income taxes in profitable jurisdictions outside the United States, which was partially offset by tax benefits from losses incurred by ExactTarget in certain state jurisdictions. We regularly assess the realizability of our deferred tax assets and establish a valuation allowance if it is more-likely-than-not that some or all of our deferred tax assets will not be realized. We evaluate and weigh all available positive and negative evidence such as historic results, future reversals of existing deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income, as well as prudent and feasible tax-planning strategies. Generally, more weight is given to objectively verifiable evidence, such as the cumulative loss in recent years. We had a valuation allowance against our U.S. deferred tax assets as we considered our cumulative loss in recent years as a significant piece of negative evidence that is difficult to overcome. We will adjust our valuation allowance in the event sufficient positive evidence overcomes the negative evidence of losses in recent years. Due to our valuation allowance, the effective tax rate could be volatile and is therefore difficult to forecast in future periods.

The increase in subscription and support revenues was primarily attributable to the impact of, in fiscal 2015 , including ExactTarget revenue for the full fiscal year, as compared to fiscal 2014 , which only included ExactTarget revenue as of its acquisition date in July 2013 . Additionally, volume-driven increases from new business, which includes new customers, upgrades and additional subscriptions from existing customers contributed to the increase in subscription and support revenues. Our attrition rate, which was consistent with the prior year, also played a role in the increase in subscription and support revenues. We invest in a variety of customer programs and initiatives, which, along with increasing enterprise adoption, have helped maintain our attrition rate. The net price per user per month for our three primary offerings, Professional Edition, Enterprise Edition and Unlimited Edition, varies from period to period, but has remained within a consistent range over the past eight quarters. Changes in the net price per user per month has not been a significant driver of revenue growth for the periods presented. Professional services and other revenues were $359.8 million, or seven percent of total revenues, for fiscal 2015, compared to $246.5 million, or six percent of total revenues, for fiscal 2014, an increase of $113.4 million, or 46 percent. The increase in professional services and other revenues was primarily attributable to the impact of, in fiscal 2015, including ExactTarget revenue for the full fiscal year, as compared to fiscal 2014, which only included ExactTarget revenue as of its acquisition date in July 2013.

Interest expense, net of interest costs capitalized, was $73.2 million for fiscal 2015 and was $77.2 million during fiscal 2014. The decrease was primarily due to the reduced principal balance on our 0.75% convertible senior notes as a result of early note conversions during fiscal 2015. These notes fully matured on January 15, 2015. Gain on sales of land and building improvements. During fiscal 2015, we sold two separate portions of our undeveloped real estate, including a portion of our perpetual parking rights, in San Francisco, California. We recognized a gain of $15.6 million during fiscal 2015, net of closing costs, as a result of this activity.

We had a tax provision primarily due to income taxes in profitable jurisdictions outside the United States, which was partially offset by tax benefits from losses incurred by ExactTarget in certain state jurisdictions. We recorded a tax benefit of $125.8 million with a pretax loss of $357.9 million, which resulted in an effective tax rate of 35 percent for fiscal 2014. Due to the ExactTarget acquisition, a deferred tax liability was established for the book-tax basis difference related to purchased intangibles. The net deferred tax liability from acquisitions provided an additional source of income to support the realizability of our pre-existing deferred tax assets. As a result, we released a portion of the valuation allowance that was established in fiscal 2013 and recorded a tax benefit of $143.1 million for fiscal 2014. We had a valuation allowance against our U.S. deferred tax assets as we considered our cumulative loss in recent years as a significant piece of negative evidence. Liquidity and Capital Resources At January 31, 2016 , our principal sources of liquidity were cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaling $2.7 billion and accounts receivable of $2.5 billion . Net cash provided by operating activities was $1.6 billion during fiscal 2016 and $1.2 billion during the same period a year ago. Cash provided by operating activities were affected by the amount of net loss adjusted for non-cash expense items such as depreciation and amortization, loss on the conversions of convertible senior notes, amortization of purchased intangibles from business combinations, amortization of debt discount, the expense associated with stock-based awards, and specifically for fiscal 2016 gains related to the termination of 50 Fremont lease and the additional sales of our land in Mission Bay; and the reclassification of excess tax benefits from employee stock plans to cash flows from financing activities; the timing of employee related costs including commissions and bonus payments; the timing of payments against accounts payable, accrued expenses and other current liabilities; the timing of collections from our customers, which is our largest source of operating cash flows; and changes in working capital accounts. Our working capital accounts consist of accounts receivables and prepaid assets and other current assets. Claims against working capital include accounts payable, accrued expenses and other current liabilities and our convertible notes. Our working capital may be impacted by factors in future periods, certain amounts and timing of which are seasonal, such as billings to customers for subscriptions and support services and the subsequent collection of those billings. As described above in Seasonal Nature of Deferred Revenue and Accounts Receivable, our fourth quarter has historically been our strongest quarter for new business and renewals. The year on year compounding effect of this seasonality in both billing patterns and overall business causes the value of invoices that we generate in the fourth quarter to increase as a proportion of our total annual billings. We generally invoice our customers for our subscription and services contracts in advance in annual installments. We typically issue renewal invoices in advance of the renewal service period, and depending on timing, the initial invoice for the subscription and services contract and the subsequent renewal invoice may occur in different quarters. Such invoice amounts are initially reflected in accounts receivable and deferred revenue, which is reflected on the balance sheet. The operating cash flow benefit of increased billing activity generally occurs in the subsequent quarter when we collect from our customers. As such, our first quarter is our largest collections and operating cash flow quarter. Net cash used in investing activities was $1.5 billion during fiscal 2016 and $698.4 million during the same period a year ago. The net cash used in investing activities during fiscal 2016 primarily related to capital expenditures, including strategic investments, business combinations, purchase of 50 Fremont land and building, new office build-outs, investment of cash balances and strategic investments offset by proceeds from sales and maturities of marketable securities and proceeds from sales of Mission Bay land, the use of restricted cash to purchase 50 Fremont land and building. Net cash used in investing activities during fiscal 2016 increased by approximately $789.5 million over the same period a year ago primarily due to cash used for the acquisition of 50 Fremont land and building and strategic investments. Net cash provided by financing activities was $132.6 million during fiscal 2016 as compared to net cash used in financing activities of $310.5 million during the same period a year ago. Net cash provided by financing activities during fiscal 2016 consisted primarily of $455.5 million from proceeds from equity plan offset by $82.3 million of principal payments on capital leases and $300.0 million payment of our revolving credit facility. Net cash flows used in financing activities during fiscal 2015 changed $443.1 million from the same period a year ago primarily due to $568.9 million payment on convertible senior notes, $285.0 million payment on term loan, offset by $297.3 million proceeds from revolving credit facility and $309.0 million of proceeds from our equity plans. In January 2010, we issued $575.0 million of 0.75% convertible senior notes due January 15, 2015 (the 0.75% Senior Notes) and concurrently entered into convertible notes hedges (the 0.75% Note Hedges) and separate warrant transactions (the 0.75% Warrants). On January 15, 2015, the 0.75% Senior Notes matured. Upon maturity of the 0.75% Senior Notes, we delivered cash up to the remaining principal amount of the 0.75% Senior Notes and shares of our common stock for the excess conversion value greater than the principal amount of the 0.75% Senior Notes. As a result of the conversions and maturity of the 0.75% Senior Notes during fiscal 2015, the Company exercised its rights on the 0.75% Note Hedges, and the 0.75% Note Hedges expired. Additionally, in fiscal 2015 the Company entered into agreements with each of the 0.75% Warrant counterparties to amend and settle the 0.75% Warrants prior to their scheduled expiration beginning in April 2015. As a result, the Company issued, in the aggregate, approximately 13.3 million shares to the counterparties to settle, via a net share settlement, the entirety of the 0.75% Warrants. The 0.25% Senior Notes will be convertible if during any 20 trading days during the 30 consecutive trading days of any fiscal quarter, our common stock trades at a price exceeding 130% of the conversion price of $66.44 per share applicable to the 0.25% Senior Notes. The 0.25% Senior Notes have not yet been convertible at the holders option. The 0.25% Senior Notes are classified as a noncurrent liability on our consolidated balance sheet as of January 31, 2016 . Our common stock did not trade at a price exceeding 130% of the conversion price of $66.44 per share applicable to the 0.25% Senior Notes during the fiscal quarter ended January 31, 2016 . Accordingly, the 0.25% Senior Notes were not convertible at the holders option for the quarter ending January 31, 2016 . In October 2014, we entered into a credit agreement (the Credit Agreement) which provides for a $650.0 million unsecured revolving credit facility (the Credit Facility) that matures in October 2019. Immediately upon closing, we borrowed $300.0 million under the Credit Facility, approximately $262.5 million of which was used to repay in full the indebtedness under our Term Loan. In March 2015, we paid down the $300.0 million of outstanding borrowings held under the Credit Facility and related interest in full. We may use any future borrowings under the Credit Facility for working capital, capital expenditures and other general corporate purposes, including permitted acquisitions. We may borrow amounts under the Credit Facility at any time during the term of the Credit Agreement. We may also prepay the borrowings under the Credit Facility, in whole or in part, at any time without premium or penalty, subject to certain conditions, and amounts repaid or prepaid may be reborrowed. As of January 31, 2016 , outstanding borrowings under the Credit Facility were $0. Borrowings under the Credit Facility bear interest, at our option at either a base rate formula or a LIBOR based formula, each as set forth in the Credit Agreement. Additionally, we are obligated to pay an ongoing commitment fee at a rate between 0.125% and 0.25%. Interest and the commitment fee are payable in arrears quarterly. The Credit Agreement contains certain customary affirmative and negative covenants, including a consolidated leverage ratio covenant, a consolidated interest coverage ratio covenant, a limit on our ability to incur additional indebtedness, dispose of assets, make certain acquisition transactions, pay dividends or distributions, and certain other restrictions on our activities each defined specifically in the Credit Agreement. We were in compliance with the Credit Agreements covenants as of January 31, 2016 . In August 2014, we sold approximately 3.7 net acres of our undeveloped real estate in San Francisco for a total of $72.5 million. Separately, in September 2014, we sold approximately 1.5 net acres of our undeveloped real estate for a total of $125.0 million. In October 2015, we sold approximately 8.8 net acres of undeveloped real estate and the associated perpetual parking rights in San Francisco, California, which were classified as held for sale. The total proceeds from the sale were $157.1 million, of which the Company received $127.1 million during fiscal 2016 and previously received a nonrefundable deposit in the amount of $30.0 million during the fiscal quarter ended April 30, 2014. In February 2015, we acquired 50 Fremont Street, a 41-story building totaling approximately 817,000 rentable square feet located in San Francisco, California (50 Fremont). We acquired 50 Fremont for the purpose of expanding our global headquarters in San Francisco. See Note 4, Business Combinations in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The total purchase price for 50 Fremont was $637.6 million. To pay for 50 Fremont, we used $115.0 million of restricted cash and assumed a $200.0 million loan secured by the property with the remainder paid in cash. Our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities are comprised primarily of corporate notes and obligations, U.S. treasury securities, U.S. agency obligations, commercial paper, asset backed securities, mortgage backed securities obligations, time deposits, money market mutual funds and municipal securities. As of January 31, 2016 , we have a total of $81.9 million in letters of credit outstanding in favor of certain landlords for office space. To date, no amounts have been drawn against the letters of credit, which renew annually and expire at various dates through December 2030. We do not have any special purpose entities, and other than operating leases for office space and computer equipment, we do not engage in off-balance sheet financing arrangements. Our principal commitments consist of obligations under leases for office space, co-location data center facilities, and our development and test data center, as well as leases for computer equipment, software, furniture and fixtures. At January 31, 2016 , the future non-cancelable minimum payments under these commitments were as follows (in thousands):  ##TABLE_START Contractual Obligations Payments Due by Period  Total  Less than 1 Year  1-3 Years  3-5 Years  More than 5 Years Capital lease obligations, including interest $ 558,411  $ 118,820  $ 238,048  $ 201,543  $ Operating lease obligations:          Facilities space 1,986,694  191,879  404,022  391,944  998,849 Computer equipment and furniture and fixtures 332,153  164,648  167,505   0.25% Convertible Senior Notes, including interest 1,157,188  2,875  1,154,313   Financing obligation - building in progress - leased facility 334,047  16,877  42,658  44,435  230,077 Contractual commitments 25,177  11,702  7,263  5,964   $ 4,393,670  $ 506,801  $ 2,013,809  $ 643,886  $ 1,229,174 ##TABLE_ENDThe majority of our operating lease agreements provide us with the option to renew. Our future operating lease obligations would change if we exercised these options and if we entered into additional operating lease agreements as we expand our operations. The financing obligation above represents the total obligation for our lease of approximately 445,000 rentable square feet of office space in San Francisco, California. As of January 31, 2016 , $196.7 million of the total obligation noted above was recorded to financing obligation, building in progress - leased facility, which is included in Other noncurrent liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets. In April 2014, we entered into an office lease agreement to lease approximately 732,000 rentable square feet of an office building located in San Francisco, California that is under construction. The lease payments associated with the lease will be approximately $590.0 million over the 15.5 year term of the lease, beginning in our first quarter of fiscal 2018, which is reflected above under Operating Leases. In February 2016, we entered into an agreement to sublease additional office space. The amounts associated with the agreement will be approximately $311.0 million over the approximately 12 year term of the agreement, beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2018. During fiscal 2016 and in future fiscal years, we have made and expect to continue to make additional investments in our infrastructure to scale our operations and increase productivity. We plan to upgrade or replace various internal systems to scale with the overall growth of the Company. Additionally, we expect capital expenditures to be higher in absolute dollars and remain consistent as a percentage of total revenues in future periods as a result of continued office build-outs, other leasehold improvements and data center investments. In the future, we may enter into arrangements to acquire or invest in complementary businesses or joint ventures, services and technologies, and intellectual property rights. We may be required to seek additional equity or debt financing. Additional funds may not be available on terms favorable to us or at all. We believe our existing cash, cash equivalents and short-term marketable securities and cash provided by operating activities will be sufficient to meet our working capital, capital expenditure and debt repayment needs over the next 12 months. New Accounting Pronouncements In May 2014 , the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) (ASU 2014-09), which amended the existing FASB Accounting Standards Codification. This standard establishes a principle for recognizing revenue upon the transfer of promised goods or services to customers, in an amount that reflects the expected consideration received in exchange for those goods or services. The standard also provides guidance on the recognition of costs related to obtaining and fulfilling customer contracts. The FASB deferred the effective date for the new revenue reporting standard for entities reporting under U.S. GAAP for one year. In accordance with the deferral, ASU 2014-09 will be effective for fiscal 2019 , including interim periods within that reporting period. We are currently in the process of assessing the adoption methodology, which allows the amendment to be applied retrospectively to each prior period presented, or with the cumulative effect recognized as of the date of initial application. We are also evaluating the impact of the adoption of ASU 2014-09 on our consolidated financial statements and have not determined whether the effect will be material to either our revenue results or our deferred commission balances. In September 2015, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2015-16, Simplifying the Accounting for Measurement-Period Adjustments (Topic 805) (ASU 2015-16) which eliminates the requirement to restate prior period financial statements for measurement period adjustments in business combinations. ASU 2015-16 requires that the cumulative impact of a measurement period adjustment (including the impact on prior periods) be recognized in the reporting period in which the adjustment is identified. The new standard is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2015 and early adoption is permitted. We are evaluating the impact of the adoption of ASU 2015-16 on our consolidated financial statements. In February 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842) (ASU 2016-02), which requires lessees to put most leases on their balance sheets but recognize the expenses on their income statements in a manner similar to current practice. ASU 2016-02 states that a lessee would recognize a lease liability for the obligation to make lease payments and a right-to-use asset for the right to use the underlying asset for the lease term. The new standard is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2018 and early adoption is permitted. We are currently evaluating the impact to our consolidated financial statements. Non-GAAP Financial Measures for Statement of Operations and Sharecount Information Regulation S-K Item 10(e), Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures in Commission Filings, defines and prescribes the conditions for use of non-GAAP financial information. Our measures of non-GAAP net income, non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP operating profit, non-GAAP free cash flow, and non-GAAP earnings per share each meet the definition of a non-GAAP financial measure. We use the below non-GAAP financial measures to provide an additional view of operational performance by excluding expenses and benefits that are not directly related to performance in any particular period. In addition to our GAAP measures, we use these non-GAAP measures when planning, monitoring, and evaluating our performance. We believe that these non-GAAP measures reflect our ongoing business in a manner that allows for meaningful period-to-period comparisons and analysis of trends in our business, as they exclude certain expenses and benefits. These items are excluded because the decisions which gave rise to them are not made to increase revenue in a particular period, but are made for our long-term benefit over multiple periods and we are not able to change or affect these items in any particular period. Non-GAAP net income We define non-GAAP net income as our total net income excluding the components described below, which we believe are not reflective of our core, ongoing operating results. In each case, for the reasons set forth below, we believe that excluding the component provides useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating the impact of certain items to our operating results and future prospects in the same manner as we do, in comparing financial results across accounting periods and to those of peer companies and in better understanding the impact of these items on our gross margin and operating performance. ##TABLE_START  Stock-Based Expense. The Companys compensation strategy includes the use of stock-based compensation to attract and retain employees and executives. It is principally aimed at aligning their interests with those of our stockholders and at long-term employee retention, rather than to motivate or reward operational performance for any particular period. Thus, stock-based expense varies for reasons that are generally unrelated to operational decisions and performance in any particular period. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Amortization of Purchased Intangibles and Acquired Leases. The Company views amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets, such as the amortization of the cost associated with an acquired companys research and development efforts, trade names, customer lists, customer relationships and acquired lease intangibles, as items arising from pre-acquisition activities determined at the time of an acquisition. While these intangible assets are continually evaluated for impairment, amortization of the cost of purchased intangibles is a static expense, one that is not typically affected by operations during any particular period. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Amortization of Debt Discount. Under GAAP, certain convertible debt instruments that may be settled in cash (or other assets) on conversion are required to be separately accounted for as liability (debt) and equity (conversion option) components of the instrument in a manner that reflects the issuers non-convertible debt borrowing rate. Accordingly, for GAAP purposes we are required to recognize imputed interest expense on the Companys $1.15 billion of convertible senior notes due 2018 that were issued in a private placement in March 2013. The imputed interest rate was approximately 2.53% for the convertible notes due 2018, while the actual coupon interest rate of the notes was 0.25%. The difference between the imputed interest expense and the coupon interest expense, net of the interest amount capitalized, is excluded from managements assessment of the Companys operating performance because management believes that this non-cash expense is not indicative of its core, ongoing operating performance. Management believes that the exclusion of the non-cash interest expense provides investors an enhanced view of the Companys operational performance. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Non-Cash Gains/Losses on Conversion of Debt. Upon settlement of the Companys convertible senior notes, we attribute the fair value of the consideration transferred to the liability and equity components of the convertible senior notes. The difference between the fair value of consideration attributed to the liability component and the carrying value of the liability as of settlement date is recorded as a non-cash gain or loss on the statement of operations. Management believes that the exclusion of the non-cash gain/loss provides investors an enhanced view of the companys operational performance. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Gain on Sales of Land and Building Improvements. The Company views the non-operating gains associated with the sales of the land and building improvements at Mission Bay to be a discrete item. The difference between the cash proceeds received and the carrying value of the land and the building improvements as of the settlement date is recorded as a one-time gain on the statement of operations. Management believes that the exclusion of the gains provides investors an enhanced view of the Companys operational performance. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Lease Termination Resulting from Purchase of Office Building. The Company views the non-cash, one-time gain associated with the termination of its lease at 50 Fremont to be a discrete item. Management believes that the exclusion of the gains provides investors an enhanced view of the Companys operational performance. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Income Tax Effects and Adjustments. Since fiscal 2015, the Company has utilized a fixed long-term projected non-GAAP tax rate in order to provide better consistency across the interim reporting periods by eliminating the effects of non-recurring and period-specific items such as changes in the tax valuation allowance and tax effects of acquisitions-related costs, since each of these can vary in size and frequency. When projecting this long-term rate, the Company evaluated a three-year financial projection that excludes the direct impact of the following non-cash items: stock-based expenses, amortization of purchased intangibles, amortization of acquired leases, amortization of debt discount, gains/losses on the sales of land and building improvements, gains/losses on conversions of debt, and termination of office leases. The projected rate also assumes no new acquisitions in the three-year period, and considers other factors including the Companys tax structure, its tax positions in various jurisdictions and key legislation in major jurisdictions where the company operates. This long-term rate could be subject to change for a variety of reasons, such as significant changes in the geographic earnings mix including acquisition activity, or fundamental tax law changes in major jurisdictions where the company operates. The Company re-evaluates this long-term rate on an annual basis and, as appropriate, if a significant event materially affects it. Our fiscal 2016 non-GAAP tax provision was 35.5 percent which reflected the related tax impact from the recent Tax Court decision in Altera Corporations litigation with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). ##TABLE_END 55 Additionally, as significant, unusual or discrete events occur, or as other events occur that are not related to the Companys core, ongoing operating results, we may exclude the financial results of these events from non-GAAP net income in the period in which such events occur. For example, we could in the future recognize a significant gain or loss in connection with one or more of our strategic investments, which may not be viewed by management as reflective of our core, ongoing operating results. Similarly, the financial effects of significant facilities-related transactions may in the future be excluded from non-GAAP net income in the period in which such events may occur, if they are not viewed by management as reflective of our core, ongoing operating results. Non-GAAP gross profit We define non-GAAP gross profit as our total revenues less cost of revenues, as reported on our consolidated statement of operations, excluding the portions of stock-based expenses and amortization of purchased intangibles that are included in cost of revenues. Non-GAAP operating profit We define non-GAAP operating profit as our non-GAAP gross profit less operating expenses, as reported on our consolidated statement of operations, excluding the portions of stock-based expenses, amortization of purchased intangibles and gain resulting from termination of our office lease that are included in operating expenses. Non-GAAP earnings per share Management uses the non-GAAP earnings per share to provide an additional view of performance by excluding items that are not directly related to performance in any particular period in the earnings per share calculation. We define non-GAAP earnings per share as our non-GAAP net income divided by basic or diluted shares outstanding. Non-GAAP free cash flow We define the non-GAAP measure free cash flow as GAAP net cash provided by operating activities, less capital expenditures. For this purpose, capital expenditures does not include our strategic investments, nor does it include any costs or activities related to our purchase of 50 Fremont land and building, and building in progress - leased facilities. Limitations on the use of non-GAAP financial measures A limitation of our non-GAAP financial measures of non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP operating profit, non-GAAP net income, non-GAAP earnings per share and non-GAAP free cash flow is that they do not have uniform definitions. Our definitions will likely differ from the definitions used by other companies, including peer companies, and therefore comparability may be limited. Thus, our non-GAAP measures of non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP operating profit, non-GAAP net income, non-GAAP earnings per share and non-GAAP free cash flow should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, or in isolation from, measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. Additionally, in the case of stock-based expense, if we did not pay a portion of compensation in the form of stock-based expense, the cash salary expense included in costs of revenues and operating expenses would be higher which would affect our cash position. We compensate for these limitations by reconciling our non-GAAP financial measures to the most comparable GAAP financial measure. We encourage investors and others to review our financial information in its entirety, not to rely on any single financial measure, and to view our non-GAAP financial measures in conjunction with the most comparable GAAP financial measures. Our reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures are as follows (in thousands, except for share numbers): ##TABLE_START   Fiscal Year Ended January 31,     Non-GAAP gross profit       GAAP gross profit  $ 5,012,668  $ 4,084,316  $ 3,102,575 Plus:       Amortization of purchased intangibles  80,918  90,300  109,356 Stock-based expenses  69,443  53,812  45,608 Non-GAAP gross profit  $ 5,163,029  $ 4,228,428  $ 3,257,539 ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START   Fiscal Year Ended January 31,     Non-GAAP income from operations       GAAP income (loss) from operations  $ 114,923  $ (145,633 )  $ (286,074 ) Plus:       Amortization of purchased intangibles  158,070  154,973  146,535 Stock-based expenses  593,628  564,765  503,280 Less:       Operating lease termination resulting from purchase of 50 Fremont  (36,617 )   Non-GAAP operating profit  $ 830,004  $ 574,105  $ 363,741 ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START   Fiscal Year Ended January 31,     Non-GAAP net income       GAAP net loss  $ (47,426 )  $ (262,688 )  $ (232,175 ) Plus:       Amortization of purchased intangibles  158,070  154,973  146,535 Amortization of acquired lease intangible  3,636   Stock-based expenses  593,628  564,765  503,280 Amortization of debt discount, net  24,504  36,575  46,728 Loss on conversion of debt   10,326  Less:       Operating lease termination resulting from purchase of 50 Fremont  (36,617 )   Gain on sales of land and building improvements  (21,792 )  (15,625 )  Income tax effects and adjustments of Non-GAAP items  (167,221 )  (146,741 )  (242,729 ) Non-GAAP net income  $ 506,782  $ 341,585  $ 221,853 ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START   Fiscal Year Ended January 31,     Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share        GAAP diluted loss per share (a)  $ (0.07 )  $ (0.42 )  $ (0.39 ) Plus:       Amortization of purchased intangibles  0.23  0.24  0.23 Amortization of acquired lease intangible  0.01  0.00  0.00 Stock-based expenses  0.88  0.87  0.79 Amortization of debt discount, net  0.04  0.06  0.07 Loss on conversion of debt  0.00  0.02  0.00 Less:       Operating lease termination resulting from purchase of 50 Fremont  (0.05 )  0.00  0.00 Gain on sales of land and building improvements  (0.03 )  (0.02 )  0.00 Income tax effects and adjustments of Non-GAAP items  (0.26 )  (0.23 )  (0.35 ) Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share  $ 0.75  $ 0.52  $ 0.35 Shares used in computing diluted net income per share  676,830  651,534  635,688 ##TABLE_ENDa) Reported GAAP loss per share was calculated using the basic share count. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share was calculated using the diluted share count. Non-GAAP operating profit for the year ended January 31, 2016 was $830.0 million and $574.1 million for the same period a year ago, an improvement of $255.9 million or 45 percent. During fiscal 2016 we remained focused on improving non-GAAP operating profit and expect to remain similarly focused in fiscal 2017. The effects of dilutive securities were not included in the GAAP calculation of diluted earnings/loss per share for the years ended January 31, 2016 , 2015 and 2014 because we had a net loss for those periods and the effect would have been anti-dilutive. The following table reflects the effect of the dilutive securities on the basic share count used in the GAAP earnings/loss per share calculation to derive the share count used for the non-GAAP diluted earnings per share:  ##TABLE_START   Fiscal Year Ended January 31, Supplemental Diluted Sharecount Information (in thousands):    Weighted-average shares outstanding for GAAP basic earnings per share  661,647  624,148  597,613 Effect of dilutive securities (1):       Convertible senior notes (2)  1,302  5,381  14,550 Warrants associated with the convertible senior note hedges (2)   9,536  9,658 Employee stock awards  13,881  12,469  13,867 Adjusted weighted-average shares outstanding and assumed conversions for Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share  676,830  651,534  635,688 ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (1) The effects of these dilutive securities were not included in the GAAP calculation of diluted net loss per share because the effect would have been anti-dilutive. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (2) Upon maturity in fiscal 2015, the convertible 0.75% senior notes and associated warrants were settled. The 0.25% senior notes were not convertible, however, there is a dilutive effect for shares outstanding for the fiscal 2016. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  Fiscal Year Ended January 31, Free cash flow analysis:   Operating cash flow      GAAP net cash provided by operating activities $ 1,612,585  $ 1,173,714  $ 875,469 Less:      Capital expenditures (284,476 )  (290,454 )  (299,110 ) Free cash flow $ 1,328,109  $ 883,260  $ 576,359 ##TABLE_ENDSupplemental Tax Expense (Benefit) Information: As described above, beginning in February 2014, which was the start of our fiscal 2015, we changed the methodology used to calculate our non-GAAP tax expense. We computed and utilized a fixed long-term projected non-GAAP tax rate of 36.5 percent for fiscal 2015. We moved to this long-term projected non-GAAP tax rate in order to provide better consistency across the interim reporting periods by eliminating the effects of non-recurring and period-specific items. As a result, we believe that starting in fiscal 2015, providing a tabular reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measure of tax expense (benefit) to the comparable GAAP measure is not appropriate given our new methodology. During the third quarter of fiscal 2013, we recorded for GAAP purposes a valuation allowance against a significant portion of our U.S. deferred tax assets. During fiscal 2014, we recorded a partial valuation allowance release, primarily in connection with the acquisition of ExactTarget. The increasing number of tax adjustments reflected below was the result of the GAAP valuation allowance and the Companys increasing acquisition activities. The following table for fiscal 2014 reflects the calculation of our non-GAAP tax expense: ##TABLE_START     Fiscal Year Ended January 31, Non-GAAP tax expense (in thousands):    GAAP tax benefit    $ (125,760 ) GAAP to Non-GAAP adjustments - tax effects of:     Stock-based expenses, amortization of purchased intangibles and amortization of debt discount, net (1)    229,277 Deferred tax asset partial valuation release    25,048 State income tax credits not benefited (2)    5,325 Acquisitions-related costs (3)    (19,708 ) Other, net    2,787 Total adjustments    242,729 Non-GAAP tax expense    $ 116,969 ##TABLE_END(1) The Company excluded stock-based expenses, amortization of purchased intangibles, and amortization of debt discount, net, in reporting its non-GAAP net income. Accordingly, the Company excluded the related tax effects of these items. The related tax effects were computed by applying the relevant statutory tax rate to these items for each respective jurisdiction. (2) During fiscal 2014, California mandated a change to the way it apportioned income to the state, which significantly reduced the Companys California income tax expense. Accordingly, for computing non-GAAP tax expense, the Company did not recognize tax benefits related to certain California research and development tax credits as the Company believed these credits may not be realized given the lowered California income tax expense. (3) During fiscal 2014, the Company excluded certain tax effects related to acquisitions in computing its non-GAAP tax expense. The majority of this adjustment was attributable to non-cash tax costs associated with the transfer of purchased intangibles. This non-cash tax item was excluded because the decisions which gave rise to these non-cash tax costs were neither made to increase revenue nor directly related to performance in any particular period, but were made for the Companys long term benefit over multiple periods. The remainder of this adjustment included the tax effects of legal and accounting fees incurred to facilitate transactions, which amount was not material. The related tax effects were computed by applying the relevant statutory tax rate to these items for each respective jurisdiction. ##TABLE_START ", "7A": " ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK ##TABLE_END Foreign Currency Exchange Risk Our results of operations and cash flows are subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates, particularly changes in the Euro, British Pound Sterling, Canadian Dollar, Australian Dollar and Japanese Yen. We seek to minimize the impact of certain foreign currency fluctuations by hedging certain balance sheet exposures with foreign currency forward contracts. Any gain or loss from settling these contracts is offset by the loss or gain derived from the underlying balance sheet exposures. In accordance with our policy, the hedging contracts we enter into have maturities of less than three months. Additionally, by policy, we do not enter into any hedging contracts for trading or speculative purposes. Interest Rate Sensitivity We had cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaling $2.7 billion at January 31, 2016 . This amount was invested primarily in money market funds, time deposits, corporate notes and bonds, government securities and other debt securities with credit ratings of at least BBB or better. The cash, cash equivalents and short-term marketable securities are held for general corporate purposes including possible acquisitions of, or investments in, complementary businesses, services or technologies, working capital and capital expenditures. Our investments are made for capital preservation purposes. We do not enter into investments for trading or speculative purposes. Our cash equivalents and our portfolio of marketable securities are subject to market risk due to changes in interest rates. Fixed rate securities may have their market value adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates, while floating rate securities may produce less income than expected if interest rates fall. Due in part to these factors, our future investment income may fall short of expectation due to changes in interest rates or we may suffer losses in principal if we are forced to sell securities that decline in market value due to changes in interest rates. However because we classify our debt securities as available for sale, no gains or losses are recognized due to changes in interest rates unless such securities are sold prior to maturity or declines in fair value are determined to be other-than-temporary. Our fixed-income portfolio is subject to interest rate risk. An immediate increase or decrease in interest rates of 100-basis points at January 31, 2016 could result in a $20.9 million market value reduction or increase of the same amount. This estimate is based on a sensitivity model that measures market value changes when changes in interest rates occur. Fluctuations in the value of our investment securities caused by a change in interest rates (gains or losses on the carrying value) are recorded in other comprehensive income, and are realized only if we sell the underlying securities. At January 31, 2015 , we had cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaling $1.9 billion . The fixed-income portfolio was also subject to interest rate risk. Changes in interest rates of 100-basis points would have resulted in market value changes of $13.5 million . Market Risk and Market Interest Risk In March 2013, we issued the 0.25% Senior Notes. Holders of the 0.25% Senior Notes may convert the 0.25% Senior Notes prior to maturity upon the occurrence of certain circumstances. Upon conversion, we would pay the holder an amount of cash equal to the principal amounts of the 0.25% Senior Notes and the amounts in excess of the principal amounts, if any, may be paid in cash or stock at our option. Concurrent with the issuance of the 0.25% Senior Notes, we entered into separate note hedging transactions and the sale of warrants. These separate transactions were completed to reduce the potential economic dilution from the conversion of the 0.25% Senior Notes. The 0.25% Senior Notes have a fixed annual interest rate of 0.25%, and therefore we do not have economic interest rate exposure on the 0.25% Senior Notes. However, the value of the 0.25% Senior Notes are exposed to interest rate risk. Generally, the fair values of our fixed interest rate 0.25% Senior Notes will increase as interest rates fall and decrease as interest rates rise. In addition, the fair value of our 0.25% Senior Notes is affected by our stock price. The principal balance of our 0.25% Senior Notes was $1.15 billion as of January 31, 2016 . The total estimated fair value of our 0.25% Senior Notes at January 31, 2016 was $1.4 billion . The fair value was determined based on the closing trading price per $100 of the 0.25% Senior Notes as of the last day of trading for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016 , which was $119.24.  In October 2014, we entered into the Credit Agreement, which provides for the $650.0 million Credit Facility that matures in October 2019. Borrowings under the Credit Facility bear interest, at our option, at either a base rate formula, as defined in the Credit Agreement, or a LIBOR based formula, each as set forth in the Credit Agreement. Additionally, we are obligated to pay an ongoing commitment fee at a rate between 0.125% and 0.25%. Interest and the commitment fees are payable in arrears quarterly. As of January 31, 2016 there was no outstanding borrowing amount under the Credit Agreement. By entering into the Credit Agreement, we have assumed risks associated with variable interest rates based upon a variable base rate, as defined in the Credit Agreement, or LIBOR. Changes in the overall level of interest rates affect the interest expense that we recognize in our statements of operations. We deposit our cash with multiple financial institutions, therefore our deposits, at times, may exceed federally insured limits. The bank counterparties to the derivative contracts potentially expose us to credit-related losses in the event of their nonperformance. To mitigate that risk, we only contract with counterparties who meet the minimum requirements under our counterparty risk assessment process. We monitor ratings, credit spreads and potential downgrades on at least a quarterly basis. Based on our on-going assessment of counterparty risk, we adjust our exposure to various counterparties. We generally enter into master netting arrangements, which reduce credit risk by permitting net settlement of transactions with the same counterparty. However, we do not have any master netting arrangements in place with collateral features. Our strategic investments portfolio consists of investments in over 150 privately held companies, primarily comprised of independent software vendors and system integrators. We invest in early-to-late stage technology and professional cloud service companies across the globe to support our key business initiatives, which include, among other things, extending the capabilities of our platform and CRM offerings, increasing the ecosystem of enterprise cloud companies and partners, accelerating the adoption of cloud technologies and creating the next-generation of mobile applications and connected products. We invest in both domestic and international companies and currently hold investments in all of our regions: the Americas, Europe and Asia Pacific. Our investments in these companies range from $0.2 million to over $70.0 million , with 14 investments individually equal to or in excess of $10 million. As of January 31, 2016 and January 31, 2015 the carrying value of our investments in privately held companies was $504.5 million and $158.0 million , respectively. The estimated fair value of our investments in privately held companies was $714.1 million and $280.0 million as of January 31, 2016 and January 31, 2015 , respectively. The financial success of our investment in any company is typically dependent on a liquidity event, such as a public offering, acquisition or other favorable market event reflecting appreciation to the cost of our initial investment. If we determine that any of our investments in such companies have experienced a decline in fair value, we may be required to record an impairment that is other than temporary, which could be material. We have in the past written off the full value of specific investments. Similar situations could occur in the future and negatively impact our financial results. All of our investments are subject to a risk of partial or total loss of investment capital.  ##TABLE_START ", "8": " ITEM 8.

Our audits also included the financial statement schedule listed in the Index at Item 15(c). These financial statements and schedule are the responsibility of the companys management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and schedule based on our audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of salesforce.com, inc. at January 31, 2016 and 2015, and the consolidated results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended January 31, 2016, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Also, in our opinion, the related financial statement schedule, when considered in relation to the basic financial statements taken as a whole, presents fairly in all material respects the information set forth therein. We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), salesforce.com inc.s internal control over financial reporting as of January 31, 2016, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission 2013 framework and our report dated March 4, 2016 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon. /s/ ERNST  YOUNG LLP San Jose, California March 4, 2016 Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm The Board of Directors and Stockholders of salesforce.com, inc. We have audited salesforce.com, inc.s internal control over financial reporting as of January 31, 2016, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission 2013 framework (the COSO criteria). Salesforce.com, inc.s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Managements Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the companys internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. A companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. In our opinion, salesforce.com, inc. maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of January 31, 2016, based on the COSO criteria. We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated balance sheets of salesforce.com, inc. as of January 31, 2016 and 2015, and the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive loss, stockholders equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended January 31, 2016 of salesforce.com, inc. and our report dated March 4, 2016 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.  /s/ E RNST  Y OUNG LLP San Jose, California March 4, 2016 salesforce.com, inc.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements 1. Summary of Business and Significant Accounting Policies Description of Business Salesforce.com, inc. (the Company) is a leading provider of enterprise cloud computing solutions, with a focus on customer relationship management, or CRM. The Company introduced its first CRM solution in February 2000, and has since expanded its service offerings with new editions, solutions, features and platform capabilities. The Company's mission is to help its customers transform themselves into customer-centric companies by empowering them to connect with their customers in entirely new ways. The Company's Customer Success Platform, including sales force automation, customer service and support, marketing automation, community management, analytics, application development, Internet of Things integration and the Company's professional cloud services, provide the next-generation platform of enterprise applications and services to enable customer success. Fiscal Year The Companys fiscal year ends on January 31. References to fiscal 2016, for example, refer to the fiscal year ending January 31, 2016 . Basis of Presentation On March 20, 2013, the Companys certificate of incorporation was amended to increase the number of authorized shares of common stock from 400.0 million to 1.6 billion in order to provide for a four -for-one stock split of the common stock effected in the form of a stock dividend. The record date for the stock split was April 3, 2013, and the additional shares were distributed on April 17, 2013. Each stockholder of record on the close of business on the record date received three additional shares of common stock for each share held. All share and per share data presented herein reflect the impact of the increase in authorized shares and the stock split, as appropriate. Use of Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (U.S. GAAP) requires management to make estimates and assumptions in the Companys consolidated financial statements and notes thereto. Significant estimates and assumptions made by management include the determination of: ##TABLE_START  the best estimate of selling price of the deliverables included in multiple deliverable revenue arrangements, ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed for business combinations, ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  the recognition, measurement and valuation of current and deferred income taxes, ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  the fair value of convertible notes, ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  the fair value of stock awards issued and related forfeiture rates, ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  the useful lives of intangible assets, property and equipment and building and structural components, and ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  the valuation of strategic investments and the determination of other-than-temporary impairments. ##TABLE_END Actual results could differ materially from those estimates. The Company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable, the result of which forms the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities. Principles of Consolidation The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. Segments The Company operates as one operating segment. Operating segments are defined as components of an enterprise for which separate financial information is evaluated regularly by the chief operating decision maker, who is the chief executive officer, in deciding how to allocate resources and assessing performance. Over the past few years, the Company has completed several acquisitions. These acquisitions have allowed the Company to expand its offerings, presence and reach in various market segments of the enterprise cloud computing market. While the Company has offerings in multiple enterprise cloud computing market segments, the Companys business operates in one operating segment because all of the Company's offerings operate on a single platform and are deployed in an identical way, and  the Companys chief operating decision maker evaluates the Companys financial information and resources and assesses the performance of these resources on a consolidated basis. Since the Company operates in one operating segment, all required financial segment information can be found in the consolidated financial statements. Concentrations of Credit Risk and Significant Customers The Companys financial instruments that are exposed to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities and trade accounts receivable. Although the Company deposits its cash with multiple financial institutions, its deposits, at times, may exceed federally insured limits. Collateral is not required for accounts receivable. The Company maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts receivable balances. This allowance is based upon historical loss patterns, the number of days that billings are past due and an evaluation of the potential risk of loss associated with delinquent accounts. No single customer accounted for more than five percent of accounts receivable at January 31, 2016 and 2015 . No single customer accounted for five percent or more of total revenue during fiscal 2016 , 2015 and 2014 . Geographic Locations As of January 31, 2016 and 2015 , assets located outside the Americas were 11 percent and 12 percent of total assets, respectively. Revenues by geographical region are as follows (in thousands):  ##TABLE_START   Fiscal Year Ended January 31,     Americas  $ 4,910,745  $ 3,868,329  $ 2,899,837 Europe  1,162,808  984,919  741,220 Asia Pacific  593,663  520,338  429,946  $ 6,667,216  $ 5,373,586  $ 4,071,003 ##TABLE_ENDAmericas revenue attributed to the United States was approximately 95 percent , 94 percent and 96 percent in fiscal 2016 , 2015 and 2014 , respectively. No other country represented more than ten percent of total revenue during fiscal 2016 , 2015 or 2014 . Revenue Recognition The Company derives its revenues from two sources: (1) subscription revenues, which are comprised of subscription fees from customers accessing the Companys enterprise cloud computing services and from customers paying for additional support beyond the standard support that is included in the basic subscription fees; and (2) related professional services such as process mapping, project management, implementation services and other revenue. Other revenue consists primarily of training fees. The Company commences revenue recognition when all of the following conditions are satisfied: ##TABLE_START  there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  the service has been or is being provided to the customer; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  the collection of the fees is reasonably assured; and ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  the amount of fees to be paid by the customer is fixed or determinable. ##TABLE_END 72 The Companys subscription service arrangements are non-cancelable and do not contain refund-type provisions. Subscription and Support Revenues Subscription and support revenues are recognized ratably over the contract terms beginning on the commencement date of each contract, which is the date the Companys service is made available to customers. Amounts that have been invoiced are recorded in accounts receivable and in deferred revenue or revenue, depending on whether the revenue recognition criteria have been met. Professional Services and Other Revenues The majority of the Companys professional services contracts are on a time and material basis. When these services are not combined with subscription revenues as a single unit of accounting, as discussed below, these revenues are recognized as the services are rendered for time and material contracts, and when the milestones are achieved and accepted by the customer for fixed price contracts. Training revenues are recognized as the services are performed. Multiple Deliverable Arrangements The Company enters into arrangements with multiple deliverables that generally include multiple subscriptions, premium support and professional services. If the deliverables have standalone value upon delivery, the Company accounts for each deliverable separately. Subscription services have standalone value as such services are often sold separately. In determining whether professional services have standalone value, the Company considers the following factors for each professional services agreement: availability of the services from other vendors, the nature of the professional services, the timing of when the professional services contract was signed in comparison to the subscription service start date and the contractual dependence of the subscription service on the customers satisfaction with the professional services work. To date, the Company has concluded that all of the professional services included in multiple deliverable arrangements executed have standalone value. Multiple deliverables included in an arrangement are separated into different units of accounting and the arrangement consideration is allocated to the identified separate units based on a relative selling price hierarchy. The Company determines the relative selling price for a deliverable based on its vendor-specific objective evidence of selling price (VSOE), if available, or its best estimate of selling price (BESP), if VSOE is not available. The Company has determined that third-party evidence of selling price (TPE) is not a practical alternative due to differences in its service offerings compared to other parties and the availability of relevant third-party pricing information. The amount of revenue allocated to delivered items is limited by contingent revenue, if any. For certain professional services, the Company has established VSOE as a consistent number of standalone sales of these deliverables have been priced within a reasonably narrow range. The Company has not established VSOE for its subscription services due to lack of pricing consistency, the introduction of new services and other factors. Accordingly, the Company uses its BESP to determine the relative selling price for its subscription services. The Company determines BESP by considering its overall pricing objectives and market conditions. Significant pricing practices taken into consideration include the Companys discounting practices, the size and volume of the Companys transactions, the customer demographic, the geographic area where services are sold, price lists, its go-to-market strategy, historical standalone sales and contract prices. The determination of BESP is made through consultation with and approval by the Companys management, taking into consideration the go-to-market strategy. As the Companys go-to-market strategies evolve, the Company may modify its pricing practices in the future, which could result in changes in relative selling prices, including both VSOE and BESP. Deferred Revenue The deferred revenue balance does not represent the total contract value of annual or multi-year, non-cancelable subscription agreements. Deferred revenue primarily consists of billings or payments received in advance of revenue recognition from subscription services described above and is recognized as the revenue recognition criteria are met. The Company generally invoices customers in annual installments. The deferred revenue balance is influenced by several factors, including seasonality, the compounding effects of renewals, invoice duration, invoice timing, size and new business linearity within the quarter. Deferred revenue that will be recognized during the succeeding twelve month period is recorded as current deferred revenue and the remaining portion is recorded as noncurrent. Deferred Commissions Deferred commissions are the incremental costs that are directly associated with non-cancelable subscription contracts with customers and consist of sales commissions paid to the Companys direct sales force. The commissions are deferred and amortized over the non-cancelable terms of the related customer contracts, which are typically 12 to 36 months . The commission payments are paid in full the month after the customers service commences. The deferred commission amounts are recoverable through the future revenue streams under the non-cancelable customer contracts. The Company believes this is the preferable method of accounting as the commission charges are so closely related to the revenue from the non-cancelable customer contracts that they should be recorded as an asset and charged to expense over the same period that the subscription revenue is recognized. Amortization of deferred commissions is included in marketing and sales expense in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations. Cash and Cash Equivalents The Company considers all highly liquid investments purchased with an original maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents. Cash and cash equivalents are stated at fair value. Marketable Securities Management determines the appropriate classification of marketable securities at the time of purchase and reevaluates such determination at each balance sheet date. Securities are classified as available for sale and are carried at fair value, with the change in unrealized gains and losses, net of tax, reported as a separate component on the consolidated statements of comprehensive loss. Fair value is determined based on quoted market rates when observable or utilizing data points that are observable, such as quoted prices, interest rates and yield curves. Declines in fair value judged to be other-than-temporary on securities available for sale are included as a component of investment income. In order to determine whether a decline in value is other-than-temporary, the Company evaluates, among other factors: the duration and extent to which the fair value has been less than the carrying value and its intent and ability to retain the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in fair value. The cost of securities sold is based on the specific-identification method. Interest on securities classified as available for sale is also included as a component of investment income. Fair Value Measurement The Company measures its cash equivalents, marketable securities and foreign currency derivative contracts at fair value. The additional disclosures regarding the Companys fair value measurements are included in Note 2 Investments. Property and Equipment Property and equipment are stated at cost. Depreciation is calculated on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of those assets as follows:  ##TABLE_START Computer, equipment and software 3 to 9 years Furniture and fixtures 5 years Leasehold improvements Shorter of the estimated lease term or 10 years Building and structural components Average weighted useful life of 32 years Building improvements 10 years ##TABLE_ENDWhen assets are retired or otherwise disposed of, the cost and accumulated depreciation and amortization are removed from their respective accounts and any loss on such retirement is reflected in operating expenses. Capitalized Internal-Use Software Costs The Company capitalizes costs related to its enterprise cloud computing services and certain projects for internal use incurred during the application development stage. Costs related to preliminary project activities and post implementation activities are expensed as incurred. Internal-use software is amortized on a straight-line basis over its estimated useful life, which is generally three to five years. Management evaluates the useful lives of these assets on an annual basis and tests for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances occur that could impact the recoverability of these assets. Goodwill and Intangible Assets Impairment Assessments The Company evaluates and tests the recoverability of its goodwill for impairment at least annually during the fourth quarter or more often if and when circumstances indicate that goodwill may not be recoverable. Intangible assets are amortized over their useful lives. Each period the Company evaluates the estimated remaining useful life of its intangible assets and whether events or changes in circumstances warrant a revision to the remaining period of amortization. The carrying amounts of these assets are periodically reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of these assets may not be recoverable. Recoverability of these assets is measured by comparison of the carrying amount of each asset to the future undiscounted cash flows the asset is expected to generate. If the undiscounted cash flows used in the test for recoverability are less than the carrying amount of these assets, then the carrying amount of such assets is reduced to fair value. Long- Lived Assets and Impairment Assessment The Company evaluates long-lived assets for possible impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable. This includes but is not limited to significant adverse changes in business climate, market conditions, or other events that indicate an asset's carrying amount may not be recoverable. If such review indicates that the carrying amount of long-lived assets is not recoverable, the carrying amount of such assets is reduced to fair value. There was no impairment of long-lived assets during fiscal 2016 , 2015 or 2014 . Business Combinations The Company uses its best estimates and assumptions to accurately assign fair value to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date. The Companys estimates are inherently uncertain and subject to refinement. During the measurement period, which may be up to one year from the acquisition date, the Company may record adjustments to the fair value of these tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed, with the corresponding offset to goodwill. In addition, uncertain tax positions and tax-related valuation allowances are initially established in connection with a business combination as of the acquisition date. The Company continues to collect information and reevaluates these estimates and assumptions quarterly and records any adjustments to the Companys preliminary estimates to goodwill provided that the Company is within the measurement period. Upon the conclusion of the measurement period or final determination of the fair value of assets acquired or liabilities assumed, whichever comes first, any subsequent adjustments are recorded to the Companys consolidated statements of operations. Leases and Asset Retirement Obligations The Company categorizes leases at their inception as either operating or capital leases. In certain lease agreements, the Company may receive rent holidays and other incentives. The Company recognizes lease costs on a straight-line basis once control of the space is achieved, without regard to deferred payment terms such as rent holidays that defer the commencement date of required payments. Additionally, incentives received are treated as a reduction of costs over the term of the agreement. The Company establishes assets and liabilities for the present value of estimated future costs to retire long-lived assets at the termination or expiration of a lease. Such assets are depreciated over the lease period into operating expense, and the recorded liabilities are accreted to the future value of the estimated retirement costs. The Company records assets and liabilities for the estimated construction costs incurred under build-to-suit lease arrangements to the extent it is involved in the construction of structural improvements or takes construction risk prior to commencement of a lease. Accounting for Stock-Based Expense The Company recognizes stock-based expenses related to stock options and restricted stock awards on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period of the awards, which is generally the vesting term of four years . The aggregate stock compensation remaining to be amortized to costs and expenses will be recognized over a weighted average period of 2.0 years . The Company recognizes stock-based expenses related to shares issued pursuant to its 2004 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (ESPP) on a straight-line basis over the offering period, which is 12 months . Stock-based expenses are recognized net of estimated forfeiture activity. The estimated forfeiture rate applied is based on historical forfeiture rates. The Company does not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future and therefore uses an expected dividend yield of zero in the option pricing model. The fair value of each stock option grant was estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model with the following assumptions and fair value per share:  ##TABLE_START   Fiscal Year Ended January 31,   Stock Options        Volatility  32-37 %  %  37-43 %  Estimated life  3.5 years   3.6 years   3.4 years   Risk-free interest rate  1.09-1.42 %  1.12-1.53 %  0.48-1.21 %  Weighted-average fair value per share of grants  $ 20.22   $ 17.20   $ 14.08   ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START              Fiscal Year Ended January 31,   ESPP        Volatility  30-34 %  32-35 %  31-35 %  Estimated life  0.75 years   0.75 years   0.75 years   Risk-free interest rate  0.06-0.76 %  0.07-0.23 %  0.07-0.10 %  Weighted-average fair value per share of grants  $ 19.49   $ 14.56   $ 10.30   ##TABLE_ENDThe Company estimated its future stock price volatility considering both its observed option-implied volatilities and its historical volatility calculations. Management believes this is the best estimate of the expected volatility over the expected life of its stock options and stock purchase rights. The estimated life for the stock options was based on an analysis of historical exercise activity. The estimated life of the ESPP was based on the two purchase periods within each offering period. The risk-free interest rate is based on the rate for a U.S. government security with the same estimated life at the time of the option grant and the stock purchase rights. Advertising Expenses Advertising is expensed as incurred. Advertising expense was $315.6 million , $203.6 million and $155.8 million for fiscal 2016 , 2015 and 2014 , respectively. Income Taxes The Company uses the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on temporary differences between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax laws is recognized in the consolidated statement of operations in the period that includes the enactment date. The Companys tax positions are subject to income tax audits by multiple tax jurisdictions throughout the world. The Company recognizes the tax benefit of an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the position is sustainable upon examination by the taxing authority, solely based on its technical merits. The tax benefit recognized is measured as the largest amount of benefit which is greater than 50 percent likely to be realized upon settlement with the taxing authority. The Company recognizes interest accrued and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in the income tax provision. Valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amounts that are more likely than not expected to be realized based on the weighting of positive and negative evidence. Future realization of deferred tax assets ultimately depends on the existence of sufficient taxable income of the appropriate character (for example, ordinary income or capital gain) within the carryback or carryforward periods available under the applicable tax law. The Company regularly reviews the deferred tax assets for recoverability based on historical taxable income, projected future taxable income, the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences and tax planning strategies. The Companys judgments regarding future profitability may change due to many factors, including future market conditions and the ability to successfully execute its business plans and/or tax planning strategies. Should there be a change in the ability to recover deferred tax assets, the tax provision would increase or decrease in the period in which the assessment is changed. Foreign Currency Translation The functional currency of the Companys major foreign subsidiaries is generally the local currency. Adjustments resulting from translating foreign functional currency financial statements into U.S. dollars are recorded as a separate component on the consolidated statements of comprehensive loss. Foreign currency transaction gains and losses are included in net loss for the period. All assets and liabilities denominated in a foreign currency are translated into U.S. dollars at the exchange rate on the balance sheet date. Revenues and expenses are translated at the average exchange rate during the period. Equity transactions are translated using historical exchange rates. Warranties and Indemnification The Companys enterprise cloud computing services are typically warranted to perform in a manner consistent with general industry standards that are reasonably applicable and materially in accordance with the Companys online help documentation under normal use and circumstances. The Companys arrangements generally include certain provisions for indemnifying customers against liabilities if its products or services infringe a third partys intellectual property rights. To date, the Company has not incurred any material costs as a result of such obligations and has not accrued any liabilities related to such obligations in the accompanying consolidated financial statements. The Company has also agreed to indemnify its directors and executive officers for costs associated with any fees, expenses, judgments, fines and settlement amounts incurred by any of these persons in any action or proceeding to which any of those persons is, or is threatened to be, made a party by reason of the persons service as a director or officer, including any action by the Company, arising out of that persons services as the Companys director or officer or that persons services provided to any other company or enterprise at the Companys request. The Company maintains director and officer insurance coverage that would generally enable the Company to recover a portion of any future amounts paid. The Company may also be subject to indemnification obligations by law with respect to the actions of its employees under certain circumstances and in certain jurisdictions. New Accounting Pronouncements In May 2014 , the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) (ASU 2014-09) which amended the existing FASB Accounting Standards Codification. This standard establishes a principle for recognizing revenue upon the transfer of promised goods or services to customers, in an amount that reflects the expected consideration received in exchange for those goods or services. The standard also provides guidance on the recognition of costs related to obtaining and fulfilling customer contracts. The FASB deferred the effective date for the new revenue reporting standard for entities reporting under U.S. GAAP for one year. In accordance with the deferral, ASU 2014-09 will be effective for fiscal 2019 , including interim periods within that reporting period. The Company is currently in the process of assessing the adoption methodology, which allows the amendment to be applied retrospectively to each prior period presented, or with the cumulative effect recognized as of the date of initial application. The Company is also evaluating the impact of the adoption of ASU 2014-09 on its condensed consolidated financial statements and has not determined whether the effect will be material to either its revenue results or its deferred commissions balances. In September 2015, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2015-16, Simplifying the Accounting for Measurement-Period Adjustments (Topic 805) (ASU 2015-16) which eliminates the requirement to restate prior period financial statements for measurement period adjustments in business combinations. ASU 2015-16 requires that the cumulative impact of a measurement period adjustment (including the impact on prior periods) be recognized in the reporting period in which the adjustment is identified. The new standard is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2015 and early adoption is permitted. The Company is evaluating the impact of the adoption of ASU 2015-16 on its consolidated financial statements. In November 2015, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2015-17, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes (ASU 2015-17) which requires all deferred income taxes to be classified as noncurrent on the balance sheet. The amendments would be effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016. The Company early adopted this standard retrospectively for all prior periods and reclassified all current deferred tax assets and liabilities to noncurrent deferred tax assets and liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets for all periods presented. In February 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842) (ASU 2016-02), which requires lessees to put most leases on their balance sheets but recognize the expenses on their income statements in a manner similar to current practice. ASU 2016-02 states that a lessee would recognize a lease liability for the obligation to make lease payments and a right-to-use asset for the right to use the underlying asset for the lease term. The new standard is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2018 and early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact to its consolidated financial statements. Reclassifications Certain reclassifications to the fiscal 2015 balances were made to conform to the current period presentation in the Balance Sheet. These reclassifications include strategic investments and other assets, net. 2.

The Company does not believe any of the unrealized losses represent an other-than-temporary impairment based on its evaluation of available evidence as of January 31, 2016 . The Company expects to receive the full principal and interest on all of these marketable securities. Fair Value Measurement All of the Companys cash equivalents, marketable securities and foreign currency derivative contracts are classified within Level 1 or Level 2 because the Companys cash equivalents, marketable securities and foreign currency derivative contracts are valued using quoted market prices or alternative pricing sources and models utilizing observable market inputs. The Company uses a three-tier fair value hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used in the valuation methodologies in measuring fair value:  Level 1. Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. Level 2. Other inputs that are directly or indirectly observable in the marketplace. Level 3. Unobservable inputs which are supported by little or no market activity. The following table presents information about the Companys assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value as of January 31, 2016 and indicates the fair value hierarchy of the valuation (in thousands):  ##TABLE_START Description Quoted Prices in Active Markets for Identical Assets (Level 1)  Significant Other Observable Inputs (Level 2)  Significant Unobservable Inputs (Level 3)  Balances as of January 31, 2016 Cash equivalents (1):        Time deposits $  $ 236,798  $  $ 236,798 Money market mutual funds 216,107    216,107 Commercial Paper  159,230   159,230 Agency and sovereign paper  13,599   13,599 Marketable securities:        Corporate notes and obligations  947,681   947,681 U.S. treasury securities  157,944   157,944 Mortgage backed obligations  104,025   104,025 Asset backed securities  271,252   271,252 Municipal securities  45,137   45,137 Foreign government obligations  18,051   18,051 U.S. agency obligations  16,086   16,086 Covered bonds  6,838   6,838 Foreign currency derivative contracts (2)  4,731   4,731 Total Assets $ 216,107  $ 1,981,372  $  $ 2,197,479 Liabilities        Foreign currency derivative contracts (3) $  $ 14,025  $  $ 14,025 Total Liabilities $  $ 14,025  $  $ 14,025 ##TABLE_END_____________ (1) Included in cash and cash equivalents in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet as of January 31, 2016 , in addition to $532.6 million of cash.

(3) Included in accounts payable, accrued expenses and other liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet as of January 31, 2015 . Derivative Financial Instruments The Company enters into foreign currency derivative contracts with financial institutions to reduce the risk that its cash flows and earnings will be adversely affected by foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. The Company uses forward currency derivative contracts to minimize the Companys exposure to balances primarily denominated in Euros, Japanese yen, Canadian dollars, Australian dollars and British pounds. The Companys foreign currency derivative contracts, which are not designated as hedging instruments, are used to reduce the exchange rate risk associated primarily with intercompany receivables and payables. The Companys derivative financial instruments program is not designated for trading or speculative purposes. As of January 31, 2016 and 2015 , the foreign currency derivative contracts that were not settled were recorded at fair value on the consolidated balance sheets. Foreign currency derivative contracts are marked-to-market at the end of each reporting period with gains and losses recognized as other expense to offset the gains or losses resulting from the settlement or remeasurement of the underlying foreign currency denominated receivables and payables. While the contract or notional amount is often used to express the volume of foreign currency derivative contracts, the amounts potentially subject to credit risk are generally limited to the amounts, if any, by which the counterparties obligations under the agreements exceed the obligations of the Company to the counterparties. Details on outstanding foreign currency derivative contracts related primarily to intercompany receivables and payables are presented below (in thousands):  ##TABLE_START  As of January 31,   Notional amount of foreign currency derivative contracts $ 1,274,515  $ 942,086 Fair value of foreign currency derivative contracts $ (9,294 )  $ 4,917 ##TABLE_ENDThe fair value of the Companys outstanding derivative instruments are summarized below (in thousands):  ##TABLE_START   Fair Value of Derivative Instruments   As of January 31,   Balance Sheet Location  Derivative Assets     Derivatives not designated as hedging instruments:     Foreign currency derivative contracts Prepaid expenses and other current assets $ 4,731  $ 10,611 Derivative Liabilities     Derivatives not designated as hedging instruments:     Foreign currency derivative contracts Accounts payable, accrued expenses and other liabilities $ 14,025  $ 5,694 ##TABLE_ENDThe effect of the derivative instruments not designated as hedging instruments on the consolidated statements of operations during fiscal 2016 , 2015 and 2014 , respectively, are summarized below (in thousands):  ##TABLE_START         Derivatives Not Designated as Hedging Instruments Gains (losses) on Derivative Instruments Recognized in Income     Fiscal Year Ended January 31,  Location    Foreign currency derivative contracts Other expense  $ (25,786 )  $ (1,186 )  $ ##TABLE_ENDStrategic Investments The Company's strategic investments are comprised of marketable equity securities and non-marketable debt and equity securities. Marketable equity securities are measured using quoted prices in their respective active markets and the non-marketable equity and debt securities are recorded at cost. These investments are presented on the consolidated balance sheets within strategic investments. As of January 31, 2016 , the Company had six investments in marketable equity securities with a fair value of $16.2 million , which includes an unrealized gain of $8.5 million . As of January 31, 2015 , the Company had four investments in marketable equity securities with a fair value of $17.8 million , which included an unrealized gain of $13.1 million . The change in the fair value of the investments in publicly held companies is recorded in the consolidated balance sheets within strategic investments and accumulated other comprehensive loss. The Companys interest in non-marketable debt and equity securities consists of noncontrolling debt and equity investments in privately held companies. The Companys investments in these privately held companies are reported at cost or marked down to fair value when an event or circumstance indicates an other-than-temporary decline in value has occurred. These investments are valued using significant unobservable inputs or data in an inactive market and the valuation requires the Company's judgment due to the absence of market prices and inherent lack of liquidity. As of January 31, 2016 and 2015 , the carrying value of the Companys non-marketable debt and equity securities was $504.5 million and $158.0 million , respectively. The estimated fair value of the non-marketable debt and equity securities was approximately $714.1 million and $280.0 million as of January 31, 2016 and January 31, 2015 , respectively. These investments are measured using the cost method of accounting, therefore the unrealized gains of $209.6 million and $122.0 million as of January 31, 2016 and January 31, 2015 , respectively, are not recorded in the consolidated financial statements. Strategic investments consisted of the following (in thousands): ##TABLE_START Description  Balance at beginning of year  Additions  Sales, dispositions and fair market value adjustments (1)  Balance at end of year Fiscal year ended January 31, 2016         Strategic investments  $ 175,774  386,219  (41,272 )  $ 520,721 Fiscal year ended January 31, 2015         Strategic investments  $ 92,489  101,774  (18,489 )  $ 175,774 ##TABLE_END(1) Amounts include the release of the cost-basis and the current unrealized gain or loss balance recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss when shares of a publicly-held investment are sold, disposition-related reductions of a cost-basis investment if a privately-held company within the portfolio is acquired by another company, fair market value adjustments such as cost basis reductions related to impairments that are other-than-temporary and unrealized gains or losses related to investments held in publicly traded companies. Investment Income Investment income consists of interest income, realized gains, and realized losses on the Companys cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities.

Computers, equipment and software at January 31, 2016 and 2015 included a total of $747.1 million and $734.7 million acquired under capital lease agreements, respectively. Accumulated amortization relating to computers, equipment and software under capital leases totaled $310.3 million and $206.7 million , respectively, at January 31, 2016 and 2015 . Amortization of assets under capital leases is included in depreciation and amortization expense. Land In August 2014 , the Company sold approximately 3.7 net acres of its undeveloped real estate, which had been classified as held for sale, for a total of $72.5 million . The Company recognized a gain of $7.8 million , net of closing costs, on the sale of this portion of the Companys land and building improvements. Separately, in September 2014 , the Company sold approximately 1.5 net acres of its remaining undeveloped real estate, which had been classified as held for sale, and the remaining portion of the perpetual parking rights, for a total of $125.0 million . The Company recognized a gain of $7.8 million , net of closing costs, on the sale of this portion of the Companys land, building improvements and perpetual parking rights. In October 2015 , the Company sold approximately 8.8 net acres of undeveloped real estate and the associated perpetual parking rights in San Francisco, California, which were classified as held for sale. The total proceeds from the sale were $157.1 million , of which the Company received $127.1 million in October 2015 and previously received a nonrefundable deposit in the amount of $30.0 million during April 2014. The Company recognized a gain of $21.8 million , net of closing costs, on the sale of this portion of the Companys land and building improvements and perpetual parking rights. Building In December 2013 , the Company entered into a lease agreement for approximately 445,000 rentable square feet of office space at 350 Mission Street in San Francisco, California. The space rented is for the total office space available in the building, which is in the process of being constructed. As a result of the Companys involvement during the construction period, the Company is considered for accounting purposes to be the owner of the construction project. As of January 31, 2016 , the Company had capitalized $174.6 million of construction costs, based on the construction costs incurred to date by the landlord, and recorded a corresponding current and noncurrent financing obligation liability of $15.4 million and $196.7 million , respectively. As of January 31, 2015 , the Company had capitalized $125.3 million of construction costs, based on the construction costs incurred to date by the landlord, and recorded a corresponding noncurrent financing obligation liability of $125.3 million . The total expected financing obligation associated with this lease upon completion of the construction of the building, inclusive of the amounts currently recorded, is $334.0 million , including interest (see Note 10 Commitments for future commitment details). The obligation will be settled through monthly lease payments to the landlord once the office space is ready for occupancy. To the extent that operating expenses for 350 Mission are material, the Company, as the deemed accounting owner, will record the operating expenses. In April 2015, the building was placed into service and depreciation commenced. 4. Business Combinations 50 Fremont In February 2015, the Company acquired 50 Fremont Street, a 41 -story building totaling approximately 817,000 rentable square feet located in San Francisco, California (50 Fremont). At the time of the acquisition, the Company was leasing approximately 500,000 square feet of the available space in 50 Fremont. As of January 31, 2016, the Company occupied approximately 567,000 square feet. The Company acquired 50 Fremont for the purpose of expanding its global headquarters in San Francisco. Pursuant to the acquisition agreement, the Company also acquired existing third-party leases and other intangible property, terminated the Companys existing office leases with the seller and assumed the seller's outstanding loan on 50 Fremont. In accordance with Accounting Standards Codification 805 (ASC 805), Business Combinations, the Company accounted for the building purchase as a business combination. The purchase consideration for the corporate headquarters building was as follows (in thousands): ##TABLE_START  Fair Value Cash $ 435,189 Loan assumed on 50 Fremont 200,000 Prorations due to ownership transfer midmonth 2,411 Total purchase consideration $ 637,600 ##TABLE_ENDThe following table summarizes the fair values of net tangible and intangible assets acquired (in thousands):  ##TABLE_START  Fair Value Building $ 435,390 Land 183,888 Termination of salesforce operating lease 9,483 Acquired lease intangibles 7,590 Loan assumed on 50 Fremont fair market value adjustment 1,249 Total $ 637,600 ##TABLE_ENDTo fund the purchase of 50 Fremont, the Company used $115.0 million of restricted cash that the Company had on the balance sheet as of January 31, 2015. In connection with the purchase, the Company recognized a net non-cash gain totaling approximately $36.6 million on the termination of the lease signed in January 2012. This amount reflects a gain of $46.1 million for the reversal of tenant incentives provided from the previous landlord at the inception of the lease and a loss of $9.5 million related to the termination of the Company's operating lease. The tax impact as a result of the difference between tax and book basis of the building is insignificant after considering the impact of the Company's valuation allowance. The amounts above have been included in the Company's consolidated statements of operations and consolidated balance sheet. The Company has included the rental income from third party leases with other tenants in the building, and the proportionate share of building expenses for those leases in other expense in the Company's consolidated results of operations from the date of acquisition. These amounts are recorded in other expense as this net rental income is not part of our core operations. These amounts were not material for the periods presented. Business Combinations Fiscal 2016  During fiscal 2016 , the Company acquired several companies for an aggregate of $60.1 million in cash, net of cash acquired, and has included the financial results of these companies in its consolidated financial statements from the respective dates of acquisition. These transactions, individually and in aggregate, are not material to the Company. The Company accounted for these transactions as business combinations. In allocating the purchase consideration for each company based on estimated fair values, the Company recorded $68.7 million of goodwill. Some of the goodwill balance associated with these transactions is deductible for U.S. income tax purposes. Fiscal Year 2015 RelateIQ, Inc. On August 1, 2014, the Company acquired the outstanding stock of RelateIQ, Inc. (RelateIQ), a relationship intelligence platform company that uses data science and machine learning to automatically capture data from email, calendars and smartphone calls and provide data science-driven insights in real time. The Company acquired RelateIQ for the assembled workforce and expected synergies with the Companys current offerings. The Company has included the financial results of RelateIQ in the consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisition, which have not been material to date. The acquisition date fair value of the consideration transferred for RelateIQ was approximately $340.2 million , which consisted of the following (in thousands, except share data): ##TABLE_START  Fair Value Cash $ 1,123 Common stock (6,320,735 shares) 338,033 Fair value of stock options and restricted stock awards assumed 1,050 Total $ 340,206 ##TABLE_ENDThe fair value of the stock options assumed by the Company was determined using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. The share conversion ratio of 0.12 was applied to convert RelateIQs outstanding equity awards for RelateIQs common stock into equity awards for shares of the Companys common stock. The following table summarizes the estimated fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of the date of acquisition (in thousands): ##TABLE_START  Fair Value Cash $ 39,194 Intangible assets 16,200 Goodwill 289,857 Current and noncurrent liabilities (4,700 ) Deferred tax liability (345 ) Net assets acquired $ 340,206 ##TABLE_ENDThe excess of purchase consideration over the fair value of net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired was recorded as goodwill. The fair values assigned to tangible assets acquired, liabilities assumed and identifiable intangible assets are based on managements estimates and assumptions. The following table sets forth the components of identifiable intangible assets acquired (in thousands) and their estimated useful lives as of the date of acquisition: ##TABLE_START  Fair Value  Useful Life Developed technology $ 14,470  7 years Customer relationships and other purchased intangible assets 1,730  1-3 years Total $ 16,200   ##TABLE_ENDThe amount recorded for developed technology represents the estimated fair value of RelateIQs relationship intelligence technology. The amount recorded for customer relationships represent the fair values of the underlying relationships with RelateIQ customers. The goodwill balance is primarily attributed to the assembled workforce and expanded market opportunities when integrating RelateIQs relationship intelligence technology with the Companys other offerings. The goodwill balance is not deductible for U.S. income tax purposes. The Company assumed unvested equity awards for shares of RelateIQs common stock with a fair value of $33.9 million . Of the total consideration, $1.1 million was allocated to the purchase consideration and $32.8 million was allocated to future services and will be expensed over the remaining service periods on a straight-line basis. Goodwill Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price in a business combination over the fair value of net tangible and intangible assets acquired.

Debt Convertible Senior Notes ##TABLE_START   Par Value Outstanding  Equity Component Recorded at Issuance  Liability Component of Par Value as of January 31, (in thousands)  0.25% Convertible Senior Notes due April 1, 2018 $ 1,150,000  $ 122,421 (1) $ 1,095,059  $ 1,070,692 ##TABLE_END___________ (1) This amount represents the equity component recorded at the initial issuance of the 0.25% convertible senior notes. In March 2013, the Company issued at par value $1.15 billion of 0.25% convertible senior notes (the  0.25% Senior Notes) due April 1, 2018 , unless earlier purchased by the Company or converted. Interest is payable semi-annually, in arrears on April 1 and October 1 of each year. The 0.25% Senior Notes are governed by an indenture between the Company, as issuer, and U.S. Bank National Association, as trustee. The 0.25% Senior Notes are unsecured and do not contain any financial covenants or any restrictions on the payment of dividends, the incurrence of senior debt or other indebtedness, or the issuance or repurchase of securities by the Company. If converted, holders of the 0.25% Senior Notes will receive cash equal to the principal amount, and at the Companys election, cash, shares of the Companys common stock, or a combination of cash and shares, for any amounts in excess of the principal amounts. Certain terms of the conversion features of the 0.25% Senior Notes are as follows: ##TABLE_START  Conversion Rate per $1,000 Par Value  Initial Conversion Price per Share  Convertible Date 0.25% Senior Notes 15.0512  $ 66.44  January 1, 2018 ##TABLE_ENDThroughout the term of the 0.25% Senior Notes, the conversion rate may be adjusted upon the occurrence of certain events, including any cash dividends. Holders of the 0.25% Senior Notes will not receive any cash payment representing accrued and unpaid interest upon conversion of a Note. Accrued but unpaid interest will be deemed to be paid in full upon conversion rather than canceled, extinguished or forfeited. Holders may convert the 0.25% Senior Notes under the following circumstances: ##TABLE_START  during any fiscal quarter, if, for at least 20 trading days during the 30 consecutive trading day period ending on the last trading day of the immediately preceding fiscal quarter, the last reported sales price of the Companys common stock for such trading day is greater than or equal to 130% of the applicable conversion price on such trading day share of common stock on such last trading day; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  in certain situations, when the trading price of the 0.25% Senior Notes is less than 98% of the product of the sale price of the Companys common stock and the conversion rate; ##TABLE_END 88 ##TABLE_START  upon the occurrence of specified corporate transactions described under the 0.25% Senior Notes indenture, such as a consolidation, merger or binding share exchange; or ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  at any time on or after the convertible date noted above. ##TABLE_END Holders of the 0.25% Senior Notes have the right to require the Company to purchase with cash all or a portion of the Notes upon the occurrence of a fundamental change, such as a change of control, at a purchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the 0.25% Senior Notes plus accrued and unpaid interest. Following certain corporate transactions that constitute a change of control, the Company will increase the conversion rate for a holder who elects to convert the 0.25% Senior Notes in connection with such change of control. In accounting for the issuances of the 0.25% Senior Notes, the Company separated the 0.25% Senior Notes into liability and equity components. The carrying amount of the liability component was calculated by measuring the fair value of a similar liability that does not have an associated convertible feature. The carrying amount of the equity component representing the conversion option was determined by deducting the fair value of the liability component from the par value of the 0.25% Senior Notes as a whole. The excess of the principal amount of the liability component over its carrying amount (debt discount) is amortized to interest expense over the term of the 0.25% Senior Notes. The equity component is not remeasured as long as it continues to meet the conditions for equity classification. In accounting for the transaction costs related to the 0.25% Senior Notes issuance, the Company allocated the total amount incurred to the liability and equity components based on its relative values. Transaction costs attributable to the liability component are being amortized to expense over the terms of the 0.25% Senior Notes, and transaction costs attributable to the equity component were netted with the equity component in temporary stockholders equity and stockholders equity. The 0.25% Senior Notes consisted of the following (in thousands):  ##TABLE_START  As of  January 31, 2016  January 31, 2015 Liability component :    Principal:    0.25% Senior Notes (1) $ 1,150,000  $ 1,150,000 Less: debt discount, net    0.25% Senior Notes (2) (54,941 )  (79,308 ) Net carrying amount $ 1,095,059  $ 1,070,692 ##TABLE_END(1) The effective interest rates of the 0.25% Senior Notes is 2.53% . These interest rates were based on the interest rates of a similar liability at the time of issuance that did not have an associated convertible feature. (2) Included in the consolidated balance sheets within Convertible 0.25% Senior Notes (which is classified as a noncurrent liability) and is amortized over the life of the 0.25% Senior Notes using the effective interest rate method. The total estimated fair values of the Companys 0.25% Senior Notes at January 31, 2016 was $1.4 billion . The fair value was determined based on the closing trading price per $100 of the 0.25% Senior Notes as of the last day of trading for fiscal 2016 . Based on the closing price of the Companys common stock of $68.06 on January 29, 2016, the if-converted value of the 0.25% Senior Notes exceeded their principal amount by approximately $28.0 million . Based on the terms of the 0.25% Senior Notes, the Senior Notes were not convertible at any time during the fiscal year ended January 31, 2016 . Note Hedges To minimize the impact of potential economic dilution upon conversion of the Notes, the Company entered into convertible note hedge transactions with respect to its common stock (the Note Hedges).  ##TABLE_START (in thousands, except for shares) Date  Purchase  Shares 0.25% Note Hedges March 2013  $ 153,800  17,308,880 ##TABLE_ENDThe Note Hedges cover shares of the Companys common stock at a strike price that corresponds to the initial conversion price of the respective Notes, also subject to adjustment, and are exercisable upon conversion of the Notes. The Note Hedges will expire upon the maturity of the Notes. The Note Hedges are intended to reduce the potential economic dilution upon conversion of the Notes in the event that the market value per share of the Companys common stock, as measured under the Notes, at the time of exercise is greater than the conversion price of the Notes. The Note Hedges are separate transactions and are not part of the terms of the Notes. Holders of the Notes will not have any rights with respect to the Note Hedges. The Note Hedges do not impact earnings per share.

The 0.25% Warrants were anti-dilutive for the periods presented. The 0.25% Warrants are separate transactions entered into by the Company and are not part of the terms of the 0.25% Senior Notes or the 0.25% Note Hedges. Holders of the 0.25% Senior Notes and 0.25% Note Hedges will not have any rights with respect to the 0.25% Warrants. Term Loan On July 11, 2013, the Company entered into a credit agreement (the Prior Credit Agreement) with Bank of America, N.A. and certain other lenders. The Prior Credit Agreement provided for a $300.0 million term loan (the Term Loan) maturing on July 11, 2016 (the Term Loan Maturity Date), which was entered into in conjunction with and for purposes of funding the acquisition of ExactTarget in fiscal 2014. The Term Loan bore interest at the Companys option at either a base rate plus a spread of 0.50% to 1.00% or an adjusted LIBOR rate as defined in the Prior Credit Agreement plus a spread of 1.50% to 2.00% . In October 2014, the Company repaid the Term Loan in full and the Prior Credit Agreement was terminated. Revolving Credit Facility In October 2014, the Company entered into an agreement (the Credit Agreement) with Wells Fargo, N.A. and certain other institutional lenders that provides for a $650.0 million unsecured revolving credit facility that matures on October 6, 2019 (the Credit Facility). Immediately upon closing, the Company borrowed $300.0 million under the Credit Facility, approximately $262.5 million of which was used to repay in full the indebtedness under the Company's Term Loan, as described above. Borrowings under the Credit Facility bear interest, at the Companys option at either a base rate, as defined in the Credit Agreement, plus a margin of 0.00% to 0.75% or LIBOR plus a margin of 1.00% to 1.75% . The Company is obligated to pay ongoing commitment fees at a rate between 0.125% and 0.25% . Such interest rate margins and commitment fees are based on the Companys consolidated leverage ratio for the preceding four fiscal quarter periods. Interest and the commitment fees are payable in arrears quarterly. The Company may use amounts borrowed under the Credit Facility for working capital, capital expenditures and other general corporate purposes, including permitted acquisitions. Subject to certain conditions stated in the Credit Agreement, the Company may borrow amounts under the Credit Facility at any time during the term of the Credit Agreement. The Company may also prepay borrowings under the Credit Agreement, in whole or in part, at any time without premium or penalty, subject to certain conditions, and amounts repaid or prepaid may be reborrowed. The Credit Agreement contains certain customary affirmative and negative covenants, including a consolidated leverage ratio covenant, a consolidated interest coverage ratio covenant, a limit on the Companys ability to incur additional indebtedness, dispose of assets, make certain acquisition transactions, pay dividends or distributions, and certain other restrictions on the Companys activities each defined specifically in the Credit Agreement. The Company was in compliance with the Credit Agreements covenants as of January 31, 2016 . In March 2015, the Company paid down $300.0 million of outstanding borrowings under the Credit Facility. There are currently no outstanding borrowings held under the Credit Facility as of January 31, 2016 . The weighted average interest rate on borrowings under the Credit Facility was 1.6% for the period beginning October 6, 2014 and ended March 2015. The Company continues to pay a fee on the undrawn amount of the Credit Facility. Loan Assumed on 50 Fremont The Company assumed a $200.0 million loan with the acquisition of 50 Fremont (the Loan). The Loan bears an interest rate of 3.75% per annum and is due in June 2023. The Loan initially requires interest only payments. Beginning in fiscal year 2019, principal and interest payments are required, with the remaining principal due at maturity. For the fiscal year 2016, total interest expense recognized was $7.3 million . The Loan can be prepaid at any time subject to a yield maintenance fee. The agreement governing the Loan contains certain customary affirmative and negative covenants that the Company was in compliance with as of January 31, 2016.

Stockholders Equity The Company maintains the following stock plans: the ESPP, the 2013 Equity Incentive Plan and the 2014 Inducement Equity Incentive Plan (the 2014 Inducement Plan).

On July 10, 2014, the Company adopted the 2014 Inducement Plan with a reserve of 335,000 shares of common stock for future issuance solely for the granting of inducement stock options and equity awards to new employees, including employees of acquired companies. In addition, approximately 319,000 shares of common stock that remained available for grant under the 2006 Inducement Equity Incentive Plan (the Prior Inducement Plan) as of July 9, 2014 were added to the 2014 Inducement Plan share reserve and the Prior Inducement Plan was terminated. Further, any shares of common stock subject to outstanding awards under the Prior Inducement Plan that expire, are forfeited, or are repurchased by the Company will also become available for future grant under the 2014 Inducement Plan. Termination of the Prior Inducement Plan did not affect the outstanding awards previously issued thereunder. The 2014 Inducement Plan was adopted without stockholder approval in reliance on the employment inducement exemption provided under the New York Stock Exchange Listed Company Manual. In September 2011, the Companys Board of Directors amended and restated the ESPP. In conjunction with the amendment of the ESPP, the Companys Board of Directors determined that the offerings under the ESPP would commence, beginning with a twelve month offering period starting in December 2011. As of January 31, 2016 , $37.5 million has been withheld on behalf of employees for future purchases under the ESPP and is recorded in accounts payable, accrued expenses and other liabilities. Employees purchased 3.0 million shares for $155.0 million and 3.3 million shares for $127.8 million , in fiscal 2016 and 2015 , respectively, under the ESPP. Prior to February 1, 2006, options issued under the Companys stock option plans generally had a term of 10 years. From February 1, 2006 through July 3, 2013, options issued had a term of five years.

The Companys board of directors may designate the rights, preferences, privileges and restrictions of the preferred stock, including dividend rights, conversion rights, voting rights, terms of redemption, liquidation preference, sinking fund terms, and number of shares constituting any series or the designation of any series. The issuance of preferred stock could have the effect of restricting dividends on the Companys common stock, diluting the voting power of its common stock, impairing the liquidation rights of its common stock, or delaying or preventing a change in control. The ability to issue preferred stock could delay or impede a change in control. As of January 31, 2016 and 2015 , no shares of preferred stock were outstanding. 8. Income Taxes Effective Tax Rate The domestic and foreign components of income (loss) before provision for (benefit from) income taxes consisted of the following (in thousands): ##TABLE_START   Fiscal Year Ended January 31,     Domestic  $ (49,558 )  $ (211,253 )  $ (326,392 ) Foreign  113,837  (1,832 )  (31,543 )   $ 64,279  $ (213,085 )  $ (357,935 ) ##TABLE_ENDThe provision for (benefit from) income taxes consisted of the following (in thousands): ##TABLE_START   Fiscal Year Ended January 31,     Current:       Federal  $ 40,723  $  $ (10,431 ) State  13,023  1,388  (245 ) Foreign  57,347  50,493  39,784 Total  111,093  52,774  29,108 Deferred:       Federal  1,453  8,771  (128,798 ) State  (426 )  (10,830 )  (22,012 ) Foreign  (415 )  (1,112 )  (4,058 ) Total   (3,171 )  (154,868 ) Provision for (benefit from) income taxes  $ 111,705  $ 49,603  $ (125,760 ) ##TABLE_ENDDuring fiscal 2016 , 2015 and 2014 , the Company recorded net tax benefits that resulted from allocating certain tax effects related to exercises of stock options and vesting of restricted stock directly to stockholders equity in the amount of $59.5 million , $7.7 million and $8.1 million , respectively. In fiscal 2016, the Company recorded income taxes in profitable jurisdictions outside the United States and current tax expense in the United States. The Company had U.S. current tax expense as a result of taxable income before considering certain excess tax benefits from stock options and vesting of restricted stock. In fiscal 2015 , the Company recorded income taxes in profitable jurisdictions outside the United States, which was partially offset by tax benefits from current year losses incurred by ExactTarget in certain state jurisdictions. In fiscal 2014 , the Company recorded a partial release of its valuation allowance primarily in connection with the acquisition of ExactTarget. Due to the ExactTarget acquisition, a deferred tax liability was recorded for the book-tax basis difference related to purchased intangibles. The net deferred tax liability from acquisitions provided an additional source of income to support the realizability of the Companys pre-existing deferred tax assets and as a result, the Company released a portion of its valuation allowance and recorded a tax benefit of $143.1 million . A reconciliation of income taxes at the statutory federal income tax rate to the provision for (benefit from) income taxes included in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations is as follows (in thousands): ##TABLE_START   Fiscal Year Ended January 31,     U.S. federal taxes at statutory rate  $ 22,498  $ (74,580 )  $ (125,277 ) State, net of the federal benefit  (5,260 )  (5,332 )  (10,780 ) Foreign taxes in excess of the U.S. statutory rate  (25,780 )  29,880  33,412 Change in valuation allowance  139,565  100,143  (25,048 ) Tax credits  (48,943 )  (28,056 )  (22,293 ) Non-deductible expenses  26,841  26,224  21,407 Tax expense/(benefit) from acquisitions  1,584  2,341  1,811 Other, net  1,200  (1,017 )  1,008 Provision for (benefit from) income taxes  $ 111,705  $ 49,603  $ (125,760 ) ##TABLE_END In December 2015, the U.S Tax Court (\"Tax Court\") formally entered its decision in Altera Corporation's (\"Altera\") litigation with the Internal Revenue Service (\"IRS\"). The litigation relates to the treatment of stock-based compensation expense in an inter-company cost-sharing arrangement with Altera's foreign subsidiary. In its opinion, the Tax Court accepted Altera's position of excluding stock-based compensation from its inter-company cost-sharing arrangement. However, the IRS appealed the Tax Court's decision on February 19, 2016. The Company will continue to monitor this matter and the related potential impacts to its financial statements. During the third quarter of fiscal 2016, the Company amended its inter-company cost-sharing arrangement to exclude stock-based compensation expense beginning in fiscal 2016 and accordingly, the Company recognized the related tax benefit through its tax provision. The Company also recorded a tax benefit of $30.4 million related to the Company's historical tax filing position, which was offset by the valuation allowance. In the above reconciliation, most of the Altera related tax benefit was reflected in the foreign taxes in excess of the U.S. statutory rate, which was partially offset by the change in valuation allowance. In December 2015, the Protecting Americans from Tax Hikes (PATH) Act of 2015 was signed into law, which made permanent several business-related provisions such as the research tax credit for qualifying amounts paid or incurred after December 31, 2014, and extended other expired provisions including bonus depreciation. While the retroactive benefit of the research tax credits was fully offset by an increase of the Company's valuation allowance in fiscal 2016 tax provision, the bonus depreciation election reduced the Company's taxable income before considering certain excess tax benefits from stock options and vesting of restricted stock, which correspondingly reduced U.S current tax expense by $18.9 million . In December 2014, the Tax Increase Prevention Act of 2014 was signed into law, which retroactively renewed expired provisions including research and development tax credits through the end of calendar year 2014. The enacted law change did not impact the Company's fiscal 2015 tax provision as the retroactive benefit of the research tax credits was fully offset by an increase in valuation allowance. The Company receives certain tax incentives in Switzerland and Singapore in the form of reduced tax rates. The tax reduction program in Switzerland expired in fiscal 2015, and the program in Singapore expired in fiscal 2016 . Deferred Income Taxes Deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effect of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes. Significant components of the Companys deferred tax assets and liabilities were as follows (in thousands): ##TABLE_START   As of January 31,    Deferred tax assets:     Net operating loss carryforwards  $ 260,015  $ 252,858 Deferred stock-based expense  89,532  96,753 Tax credits  211,997  152,715 Deferred rent expense  49,790  58,849 Accrued liabilities  122,950  92,506 Deferred revenue  14,261  15,664 Basis difference on strategic and other investments  26,202  24,637 Financing obligation  127,198  84,095 Deferred cost sharing adjustment  30,351  Other  22,845  20,017 Total deferred tax assets  955,141  798,094 Less valuation allowance  (439,971 )  (293,097 ) Deferred tax assets, net of valuation allowance  515,170  504,997 Deferred tax liabilities:     Deferred commissions  (121,071 )  (107,197 ) Purchased intangibles  (160,200 )  (213,920 ) Unrealized gains on investments  (2,858 )  (1,793 ) Depreciation and amortization  (224,435 )  (171,908 ) Other  (2,207 )  (3,157 ) Total deferred tax liabilities  (510,771 )  (497,975 ) Net deferred tax assets  $ 4,399  $ 7,022 ##TABLE_ENDAt January 31, 2016 , for federal income tax purposes, the Company had net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $2.3 billion , which expire in fiscal 2021 through fiscal 2036, federal research and development tax credits of approximately $146.3 million , which expire in fiscal 2020 through fiscal 2036, foreign tax credits of approximately $26.8 million , which expire in fiscal 2019 through fiscal 2026, and minimum tax credits of $0.7 million , which have no expiration date. For California income tax purposes, the Company had net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $845.0 million which expire beginning in fiscal 2017 through fiscal 2036, California research and development tax credits of approximately $124.2 million , which do not expire, and $9.5 million of enterprise zone tax credits, which expire in fiscal 2025. For other states income tax purposes, the Company had net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $1.1 billion which expire beginning in fiscal 2017 through fiscal 2036 and tax credits of approximately $11.1 million , which expire beginning in fiscal 2021 through fiscal 2026. Utilization of the Companys net operating loss carryforwards may be subject to substantial annual limitation due to the ownership change limitations provided by the Internal Revenue Code and similar state provisions. Such an annual limitation could result in the expiration of the net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards before utilization. The Company regularly assesses the realizability of its deferred tax assets and establishes a valuation allowance if it is more-likely-than-not that some or all of its deferred tax assets will not be realized. The Company evaluates and weighs all available positive and negative evidence such as historic results, future reversals of existing deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income, as well as prudent and feasible tax-planning strategies. Generally, more weight is given to objectively verifiable evidence, such as the cumulative loss in recent years. The Company recorded a valuation allowance as it considered its cumulative loss in recent years as a significant piece of negative evidence that is difficult to overcome. During fiscal 2016, the valuation allowance increased by $146.9 million , primarily due to federal and state research tax credits and other U.S deferred tax assets. The Company will continue to assess the realizability of the deferred tax assets in each of the applicable jurisdictions going forward. The excess tax benefits associated with stock option exercises are recorded directly to stockholders equity only when such benefits are realized following the tax law ordering approach. As a result, the excess tax benefits included in net operating loss carryforwards but are not reflected in deferred tax assets for fiscal 2016 and 2015 are $623.2 million and $527.2 million , respectively. Tax Benefits Related to Stock-Based Expense The total income tax benefit related to stock-based awards was $180.2 million , $170.8 million and $147.8 million for fiscal 2016 , 2015 and 2014 , respectively, the majority of which was not recognized as a result of the valuation allowance. Unrecognized Tax Benefits and Other Considerations The Company records liabilities related to its uncertain tax positions. Tax positions for the Company and its subsidiaries are subject to income tax audits by multiple tax jurisdictions throughout the world. Certain prior year tax returns are currently being examined by various taxing authorities in countries including the United States, Switzerland and the United Kingdom. The Company recognizes the tax benefit of an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the position is sustainable upon examination by the taxing authority, based on the technical merits. The tax benefit recognized is measured as the largest amount of benefit which is greater than 50 percent likely to be realized upon settlement with the taxing authority. The Company had gross unrecognized tax benefits of $ 172.7 million , $ 146.2 million , and $102.3 million as of January 31, 2016 , 2015 and 2014 respectively. A reconciliation of the beginning and ending balance of total unrecognized tax benefits for fiscal years 2016 , 2015 and 2014 is as follows (in thousands): ##TABLE_START   Fiscal Year Ended January 31,     Balance as of February 1,  $ 146,188  $ 102,275  $ 75,144 Tax positions taken in prior period:      Gross increases  7,456  17,938  8,420 Gross decreases  (7,264 )  (1,967 )  (4,466 ) Tax positions taken in current period:      Gross increases  38,978  34,226  27,952 Settlements  (8,684 )   Lapse of statute of limitations  (781 )  (1,224 )  (5,205 ) Currency translation effect  (3,152 )  (5,060 )  Balance as of January 31,  $ 172,741  $ 146,188  $ 102,275 ##TABLE_ENDFor fiscal 2016 , 2015 and 2014 total unrecognized tax benefits in an amount of $56.2 million , $44.6 million and $34.9 million , respectively, if recognized, would reduce income tax expense and the Companys effective tax rate after considering the impact of the change in valuation allowance in the U.S. The Company recognizes accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in the income tax provision. The Company accrued penalties and interest in the amount of $1.3 million , $1.3 million and $0.6 million in income tax expense during fiscal 2016 , 2015 and 2014 , respectively. The balance in the non-current income tax payable related to penalties and interest was $6.3 million , $4.6 million and $3.3 million as of January 31, 2016 , 2015 and 2014 , respectively. The Company has operations and taxable presence in multiple jurisdictions in the U.S. and outside of the U.S. Tax positions for the Company and its subsidiaries are subject to income tax audits by multiple tax jurisdictions around the world. The Company currently considers U.S. federal and state, Canada, Japan, Australia, Germany, France and the United Kingdom to be major tax jurisdictions. The Companys U.S. federal and state tax returns since February 1999, which was the inception of the Company, remain open to examination. With some exceptions, tax years prior to fiscal 2008 in jurisdictions outside of U.S. are generally closed. However, in Japan and United Kingdom, the Company is no longer subject to examinations for years prior to fiscal 2014 and fiscal 2011, respectively. The Company is currently under audit by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service and California Franchise Tax Board for fiscal 2011 to 2012 and fiscal 2009 to 2010, respectively. Additionally, examinations are conducted in other international jurisdictions, including Switzerland and the United Kingdom. During fiscal 2016, the Company completed examinations or effectively settled on tax positions with various taxing authorities and accordingly, decreased unrecognized tax benefits by $8.7 million resulting from settlements. The Company regularly evaluates its uncertain tax positions and the likelihood of outcomes from these tax examinations. Significant judgment and estimates are necessary in the determination of income tax reserves. The Company believes that it has provided adequate reserves for its income tax uncertainties. However, the outcome of the tax audits cannot be predicted with certainty. If any issues addressed in the Company's tax audits are resolved in a manner inconsistent with management's expectations, the Company could adjust its provision for income taxes in the future. In the next twelve months, as some of these ongoing examinations are completed and tax positions in these tax years meet the conditions of being effectively settled, the Company anticipates it is reasonably possible that a decrease of unrecognized tax benefits up to approximately $15 million may occur. 9. Earnings/Loss Per Share Basic earnings/loss per share is computed by dividing net income (loss) by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding for the fiscal period. Diluted earnings/loss per share is computed by giving effect to all potential weighted average dilutive common stock, including options, restricted stock units, warrants and the convertible senior notes. The dilutive effect of outstanding awards and convertible securities is reflected in diluted earnings per share by application of the treasury stock method. Diluted loss per share for fiscal 2016 , 2015 and 2014 are the same as basic loss per share as there is a net loss in these periods and inclusion of potentially issuable shares is anti-dilutive. A reconciliation of the denominator used in the calculation of basic and diluted loss per share is as follows (in thousands):  ##TABLE_START   Fiscal Year Ended January 31,     Numerator:       Net loss  $ (47,426 )  $ (262,688 )  $ (232,175 ) Denominator:       Weighted-average shares outstanding for basic loss per share  661,647  624,148  597,613 Effect of dilutive securities:       Convertible senior notes    Employee stock awards    Warrants    Adjusted weighted-average shares outstanding and assumed conversions for diluted loss per share  661,647  624,148  597,613 ##TABLE_ENDThe weighted-average number of shares outstanding used in the computation of basic and diluted earnings/loss per share does not include the effect of the following potential outstanding common stock. The effects of these potentially outstanding shares were not included in the calculation of diluted earnings/loss per share because the effect would have been anti-dilutive (in thousands):  ##TABLE_START   Fiscal Year Ended January 31,     Employee Stock awards  26,615  22,157  19,664 Convertible senior notes  17,309  25,953  43,965 Warrants  17,309  37,517  44,253 ##TABLE_END10. Commitments Letters of Credit As of January 31, 2016 , the Company had a total of $81.9 million in letters of credit outstanding substantially in favor of certain landlords for office space. These letters of credit renew annually and expire at various dates through December 2030. Leases The Company leases facilities space and certain fixed assets under non-cancelable operating and capital leases with various expiration dates. As of January 31, 2016 , the future minimum lease payments under non-cancelable operating and capital leases are as follows (in thousands):  ##TABLE_START  Capital Leases  Operating Leases  Financing Obligation, Building in Progress-Leased Facility(1) Fiscal Period:      Fiscal 2017 $ 118,820  $ 356,527  $ 16,877 Fiscal 2018 122,467  319,878  21,107 Fiscal 2019 115,581  251,649  21,551 Fiscal 2020 201,543  202,514  21,995 Fiscal 2021  189,430  22,440 Thereafter  998,849  230,077 Total minimum lease payments 558,411  $ 2,318,847  $ 334,047 Less: amount representing interest (60,207 )   Present value of capital lease obligations $ 498,204   ##TABLE_END______________ (1) Total Financing Obligation, Building in Progress-Leased Facility noted above represents the total obligation on the lease agreement noted in Note 3 Property and Equipment and includes $196.7 million that was recorded to Financing obligation, building in progress-leased facility, which is included in Other noncurrent liabilities on the balance sheet. The Companys agreements for the facilities and certain services provide the Company with the option to renew. The Companys future contractual obligations would change if the Company exercised these options. The terms of the lease agreements provide for rental payments on a graduated basis. The Company recognizes rent expense on a straight-line basis over the lease period and has accrued for rent expense incurred but not paid. Of the total operating lease commitment balance of $2.3 billion , approximately $2.0 billion is related to facilities space. The remaining commitment amount is related to computer equipment and furniture and fixtures. Rent expense for fiscal 2016 , 2015 and 2014 was $174.6 million , $162.8 million and $123.6 million , respectively. 11. Employee Benefit Plan The Company has a 401(k) plan covering all eligible employees in the United States and Canada. Since January 1, 2006, the Company has been contributing to the plan. Total Company contributions during fiscal 2016 , 2015 and 2014 , were $45.6 million , $38.1 million and $27.9 million , respectively. 12. Legal Proceedings and Claims In the ordinary course of business, the Company is or may be involved in various legal proceedings and claims related to alleged infringement of third-party patents and other intellectual property rights, commercial, corporate and securities, labor and employment, class actions, wage and hour, and other claims. The Company has been, and may in the future be, put on notice and/or sued by third parties for alleged infringement of their proprietary rights, including patent infringement. In July 2015, the Company and certain of its current and former directors were named as defendants in a purported shareholder derivative action in the Superior Court for the State of California, County of San Francisco. The plaintiff filed an amended version of this derivative complaint in November 2015. The derivative complaint alleged that excessive compensation was paid to such directors for their service and included allegations of breach of fiduciary duty and unjust enrichment, and sought restitution and disgorgement of a portion of the directors' compensation as well as reform of a Company equity plan. Because the complaint was derivative in nature, it did not seek monetary damages from the Company. In February 2016, the parties agreed to dismiss the complaint with prejudice as to the plaintiff and submitted a stipulation to that effect to the Court. In March 2016, the Court entered the order of dismissal. Neither the Company nor the individual defendants paid any consideration to the plaintiff. During fiscal 2015, the Company received a communication from a large technology company alleging that the Company infringed certain of its patents. The Company continues to analyze this claim and no litigation has been filed to date. There can be no assurance that this claim will not lead to litigation in the future. The resolution of this claim is not expected to have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial condition, but it could be material to operating results or cash flows or both of a particular quarter. In general, the resolution of a legal matter could prevent the Company from offering its service to others, could be material to the Companys financial condition or cash flows, or both, or could otherwise adversely affect the Companys operating results. The Company makes a provision for a liability relating to legal matters when it is both probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. These provisions are reviewed at least quarterly and adjusted to reflect the impacts of negotiations, estimated settlements, legal rulings, advice of legal counsel and other information and events pertaining to a particular matter. In managements opinion, resolution of all current matters is not expected to have a material adverse impact on the Companys consolidated results of operations, cash flows or financial position. However, depending on the nature and timing of any such dispute, an unfavorable resolution of a matter could materially affect the Companys future results of operations or cash flows, or both, of a particular quarter. 13. Related-Party Transactions In January 1999, the Salesforce.com Foundation, also referred to as the Foundation, was chartered on an idea of leveraging the Companys people, technology, and resources to help improve communities around the world. The Company calls this integrated philanthropic approach the 1-1-1 model. Beginning in 2008, Salesforce.org, which is a non-profit public benefit corporation, was established to resell the Company's services to nonprofit organizations and certain higher education organizations. The Companys chairman is the chairman of both the Foundation and Salesforce.org. The Companys chairman holds one of the three Foundation board seats. The Companys chairman, one of the Companys employees and one of the Companys board members hold three of Salesforce.orgs nine board seats. The Company does not control the Foundations or Salesforce.org's activities, and accordingly, the Company does not consolidate either of the related entities' statement of activities with its financial results. Since the Foundations and Salesforce.orgs inception, the Company has provided at no charge certain resources to those entities' employees such as office space, furniture, equipment, facilities, services, and other resources. The value of these items was approximately $1.2 million for the fiscal year 2016. The resource sharing agreement was amended in August 2015 to include resources outside of the United States and is more explicit about the types of resources that the Company will provide. Additionally, the Company has donated subscriptions of the Companys services to other qualified non-profit organizations. The Company also allows Salesforce.org to resell the Companys service to non-profit organizations and certain higher education entities. The Company does not charge Salesforce.org for these subscriptions, therefore revenue from subscriptions provided to non-profit organizations is donated back to the community through charitable grants made by the Foundation and Salesforce.org. The reseller agreement was amended in August 2015 to include additional customer segments and certain customers outside the U.S. and was amended in October 2015 to add an addendum with model clauses for the processing of personal data transferred from the European Economic Area. The value of the subscriptions pursuant to reseller agreements was approximately $69.9 million for the fiscal year 2016. The Company plans to continue these programs. 14. Subsequent Events In February 2016, the Company acquired the outstanding stock of SteelBrick, Inc. (SteelBrick), a next generation quote-to-cash platform, delivered 100 percent natively on the Salesforce platform, that offers apps for automating the entire deal close process-from generating quotes and configuring orders to collecting cash. The Company acquired SteelBrick for its employees and product offerings. Beginning with fiscal quarter ended April 30, 2016, the Company will include the financial results of SteelBrick in its condensed consolidated financial statements from the date of the acquisition. The total estimated consideration for SteelBrick was over $300.0 million and primarily in shares. In February 2016, the Company entered into an agreement to sublease additional office space. The amounts associated with the agreement will be approximately $311.0 million over the approximately 12 year term of the agreement, beginning in the Company's first quarter of fiscal 2018. 15.

CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES ##TABLE_END (a) Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act), as of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K. In designing and evaluating our disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any disclosure controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. In addition, the design of disclosure controls and procedures must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and that management is required to apply its judgment in evaluating the benefits of possible controls and procedures relative to their costs. Based on managements evaluation, our chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are designed to, and are effective to, provide assurance at a reasonable level that the information we are required to disclose in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in Securities and Exchange Commission rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. (b) Managements Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f). Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of January 31, 2016 based on the guidelines established in the Internal ControlIntegrated Framework (2013 framework) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). Our internal control over financial reporting includes policies and procedures that provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external reporting purposes in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Based on the results of our evaluation, our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of January 31, 2016 . We reviewed the results of managements assessment with our Audit Committee. The effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of January 31, 2016 has been audited by Ernst  Young LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in its report which is included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. (c) Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting There was no change in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended January 31, 2016 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. (d) Inherent Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls Our management, including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, do not expect that our disclosure controls or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the Company have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty, and that breakdowns can occur because of a simple error or mistake. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people or by management override of the controls. The design of any system of controls is also based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions; over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or the degree of compliance with policies or procedures may deteriorate. Because of the inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected. ##TABLE_START ", "9B": " ITEM 9B.

BUSINESS Overview Salesforce is a leading provider of enterprise software, delivered through the cloud, with a focus on customer relationship management, or CRM. We introduced our first CRM solution in 2000, and we have since expanded our service offerings into new areas and industries with new editions, features and platform capabilities. Our core mission is to empower our customers to connect with their customers in entirely new ways through cloud, mobile, social, Internet of Things (IoT) and artificial intelligence technologies. Our service offerings are intuitive and easy to use. They can be deployed rapidly, configured easily and integrated with other platforms and enterprise applications, or apps. We deliver our service offerings via major internet browsers and on leading mobile devices. We sell to businesses of all sizes and in almost every industry worldwide on a subscription basis, primarily through our direct sales efforts and also indirectly through partners. Through our platform and other developer tools, we also encourage third parties to develop additional functionality and new apps that run on our platform, which are sold separately from, or in conjunction with, our service offerings. Our Customer Success Platform is a comprehensive portfolio of service offerings providing sales force automation, customer service and support, marketing automation, digital commerce, community management, analytics, application development, IoT integration, collaborative productivity tools and our professional cloud services. Salesforce also believes in giving back. We pioneered, and have inspired other companies to adopt, an integrated philanthropy model called the 1-1-1 model, which leverages 1% of a company's equity, employee time and product to help improve communities around the world. We also believe in equality for all, and have spearheaded initiatives to create a world where equal pay, equal advancement, equal opportunity and equal rights become a reality for our employees and the broader world. We were incorporated in Delaware in February 1999. Our principal executive offices are located in San Francisco, California, and our principal website address is www.salesforce.com. Our office address is The Landmark @ One Market, Suite 300, San Francisco, California 94105. The Age of the Customer At Salesforce, we believe we are living in the single most innovative era in history, as everyone and every thing becomes connected. There are now billions of mobile phones and intelligent connected devices. And behind each and every device, interaction, product and connected community is a customer. Companies have the opportunity to harness all of this information about customers in new and extraordinary ways, enabling them to intelligently connect and engage with customers across every part of the customer experience. Our Customer Success Platform provides a single view of the customer across all touchpoints. We bring together the power of cloud, mobile, social, IoT and artificial intelligence technologies, enabling our customers to harness data and deliver the connected experiences their customers are increasingly coming to expect. Our Cloud Service Offerings Our cloud service offerings empower our customers to: ##TABLE_START  grow their sales faster; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  deliver customer service through multiple devices and channels; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  create one-to-one customer journeys; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  personalize buying experiences across all channels; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  build branded communities for customers, partners and employees; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  deliver analytics and predictive insights for every business user; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  turn data generated by the IoT into meaningful actions; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  collaborate on documents, spreadsheets and more to improve productivity, and; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  develop modern mobile and desktop apps quickly and easily. ##TABLE_END Our cloud service offerings are as follows: Sales Cloud. The Sales Cloud, which was our first offering and continues to be the largest contributor to total subscription and support revenues, enables companies to store data, monitor leads and progress, forecast opportunities, gain insights through relationship intelligence and collaborate around any sale on desktop and mobile devices. Our customers use the Sales Cloud to grow their sales pipelines, improve sales productivity, simplify complex business processes and close more deals. The Sales Cloud also offers solutions for partner relationship management, including channel management and partner communities, and the ability to deliver quotes, contracts and invoices to improve forecasting and collect payments faster. Service Cloud. The Service Cloud, which is our second largest contributor to total subscription and support revenues, enables companies to deliver smarter, faster and more personalized customer service and support. Our customers use the Service Cloud to connect their service agents with customers anytime and anywhere, on popular devices and across multiple channels  phone, email, chat, live video, SMS, self-service web portals, social networks, online communities and directly within their own products and mobile apps. In addition, Service Cloud also offers a field service solution that enables companies to connect agents, dispatchers and mobile employees through one centralized platform, through which they can schedule and dispatch work intelligently, and track and manage jobs in real-time. Marketing Cloud. The Marketing Cloud enables companies to plan, personalize and optimize one-to-one customer interactions across email, mobile, social, web and connected products. In addition, companies can segment and target audiences to power precise digital marketing at scale. With the Marketing Cloud, customer data can also be integrated with the Sales Cloud and Service Cloud in the form of leads, contacts and customer service cases to give companies a complete view of their customers. Commerce Cloud. The Commerce Cloud empowers brands to deliver a comprehensive digital commerce experience across web, mobile, social and store. It also offers mobile-first point-of-sale and store operations capabilities that increase store personnel effectiveness, connecting the physical and digital commerce experiences. Community Cloud. The Community Cloud enables companies to quickly create and manage trusted, branded digital destinations for customers, partners and employees. This allows companies to engage and collaborate directly with groups of people by giving them access to relevant information, apps and experts. IoT Cloud. The IoT Cloud enables companies to harness the power behind billions of connected devices, products, sensors and apps to derive entirely new levels of customer insights. With those insights, companies can sell, service and market to their customers in smarter, more personalized ways, and engage proactively with them in real time. Analytics Cloud. The Analytics Cloud enables any employee across an organization to quickly and easily explore business data, uncover new insights, make smarter decisions and take action from any device. The Analytics Cloud embeds insights related to the context of the business users' roles directly into the workflows and apps they use to make analytics easier and more intuitive, collaborative and actionable. Salesforce Quip. Salesforce Quip is a next-generation productivity solution designed for teams with a mobile-first strategy, empowering everyone to collaborate more effectively, work smarter and supercharge their productivity, all without email. Salesforce Quip combines documents, spreadsheets, task lists and team chat in one seamless experience known as a living document. Salesforce Platform. The Salesforce Platform (formerly App Cloud) is for building enterprise apps  powering Salesforce's CRM apps, with thousands of partner-built apps and millions of custom apps built by customers. The Salesforce Platform offers a new continuum of tools, frameworks and services that customers and partners need to build connected apps fast. Professional Cloud Services We offer professional cloud services including consulting, deployment, training, user-centric design and integration to help customers to achieve business results faster through adoption of Salesforce solutions. We also offer architects and innovation program teams that act as advisors to plan and execute digital transformations for our customers, providing mission critical support, cloud specialists and pre-packaged accelerators that allow our customers to build on the best practices of our community. We offer several education service offerings to our customers and partners, ranging from introductory online courses to advanced architecture certifications. With the Trailhead learning platform, our customers and partners have access to free online courses that address topics such as using and administering our services and developing on our platform. For more advanced education, we offer instructor-led and online courses to certify our customers and partners on architecting, administering, deploying and developing our service offerings. In addition, we make available a selection of online educational classes at no charge to customers that subscribe to our customer service plans. Business Benefits of Using Our Solution The key advantages of our solution include: Secure, private, scalable and reliable. Our service has been designed to provide our customers with privacy and high levels of performance, reliability and security. We have built, and continue to invest in, a comprehensive security infrastructure, including firewalls, intrusion detection systems, and encryption for transmissions over the Internet, which we monitor and test on a regular basis. We built and maintain a multi-tenant application architecture that has been designed to enable our service to scale securely, reliably and cost effectively. Our multi-tenant application architecture maintains the integrity and separation of customer data while still permitting all customers to use the same application functionality simultaneously. Rapid deployment and lower total cost of ownership. Our services can be deployed rapidly since our customers do not have to spend time procuring, installing or maintaining the servers, storage, networking equipment, security products or other hardware and software. We enable customers to achieve up-front savings relative to the traditional enterprise software model. Customers benefit from the predictability of their future costs since they generally pay for the service on a per subscriber basis for the term of the subscription contract. Ease of integration and configuration. Information technology (IT) professionals are able to integrate and configure our solutions with existing applications quickly and seamlessly. We provide a set of application programming interfaces (APIs) that enable customers and independent software developers to both integrate our solution with existing third-party, custom and legacy apps and write their own application services that integrate with our solutions. For example, many of our customers use our Salesforce Platform (formerly App Cloud) API to move customer-related data from custom-developed and packaged applications into our services on a periodic basis to provide greater visibility into their activities. High levels of user adoption. We have designed our solutions to be intuitive and easy to use. Our solutions contain many tools and features recognizable to users of popular consumer web services, so users have a more familiar user experience than typical enterprise applications. As a result, our users can often use and gain benefit from our solutions with minimal training. We have also designed our solutions to be used on popular mobile devices, making it possible for people to conduct business from their phones. Rapid development of apps and increased innovation. Our customers and third-party developers can create apps rapidly because of the ease of use and the benefits of a multi-tenant platform. We provide the capability for business users to easily configure our applications to suit their specific needs, and also support a variety of programming languages so developers can code complex apps spanning multiple business processes and deliver them via multiple mobile devices. By providing infrastructure and development environments on demand, we provide developers the opportunity to create new and innovative apps without having to invest in hardware. Developers with ideas for a new app can create, test and support their solutions on the Salesforce Platform and make the app accessible for a subscription fee to customers. Continuous innovation. We release hundreds of new features to all of our customers three times a year. Our metadata-driven, global multi-tenant cloud runs on a single code base, which enables every customer to run their business on the latest release without disruption. Because we deploy all upgrades on our servers, new features and functionality automatically become part of our service on the upgrade release date and therefore benefits all of our customers immediately. Positive environmental impact. Our multi-tenant cloud computing model has a much smaller environmental footprint than traditional IT hardware and software. When organizations move business applications to Salesforce, they can significantly reduce their energy use and carbon footprint compared to traditional on-premises solutions. Our Strategy Key elements of our strategy include: Extending existing service offerings. We offer multiple editions of our service offerings at different price points to meet the needs of customers of different sizes and we have designed our solutions to easily accommodate new features and functionality. We intend to continue to extend all editions of our solutions with new features, functions and increased security through our own development, acquisitions and partnerships. Over the last year, for example, we have invested heavily in artificial intelligence capabilities to create Salesforce Einstein, which will allow users of our products to deliver more predictive customer experiences. Cross selling and upselling. We see significant opportunity to deepen our relationships with our existing customers. As our customers realize the benefits of our services, we aim to upgrade the customer to premium editions and sell more subscriptions by targeting additional functional areas and business units, ultimately becoming our customers' trusted advisors, inspiring enterprise-wide transformation and accelerating strategic engagements through direct engagement with the highest levels of our customers' executive management. Expanding into new horizontal markets. As part of our growth strategy, we are delivering innovative solutions in new categories, including analytics, commerce and IoT. We drive innovation both organically and through acquisitions, such as our July 2016 acquisition of Demandware, a digital commerce leader. Targeting vertical markets. In order to meet the needs of our customers in certain industries, we also provide solutions specifically built for certain vertical industries, such as financial services, healthcare and government. Extending go-to-market capabilities. We believe that our offerings provide significant value for businesses of any size. We will continue to pursue businesses of all sizes in top industries and major regions globally, primarily through our direct sales force. We have steadily increased and plan to continue to increase the number of direct sales professionals we employ, and we intend to develop additional distribution channels for our solutions around the globe. Reducing customer attrition. Our goal is to have all of our customers renew their subscriptions prior to the end of their contractual terms. We run customer success and other related programs in an effort to secure renewals of existing customers. Encouraging the development of third-party applications on our cloud computing platforms. The Salesforce Platform enables existing customers, independent software vendors (ISVs) and third-party developers to create and deliver cloud-based apps. It is a platform on which apps can be created, tested, published and run. In addition, these apps can be marketed and sold on the AppExchange, our online marketplace for business apps, or sold directly by software vendors. We believe our ecosystem of developers and software vendors will address the business requirements of both current and future customers. In addition to the key elements of our business strategy described above, from time to time, we evaluate opportunities to acquire or invest in complementary businesses, services and technologies, and intellectual property rights. This evaluation resulted in our acquisition in fiscal 2017 of several companies, such as: ##TABLE_START  SteelBrick, Inc., which provides us with apps to automate the quote-to-cash process, ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  MetaMind, Inc., which allows us to extend our intelligence in natural language processing and image recognition across our clouds, ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  BeyondCore, Inc., which provides us with smart data discovery technology that automatically explores millions of variable combinations from structured data sources, ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Demandware, Inc., which allows us to expand our position in CRM and pursue the digital commerce market, ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Quip, Inc., which provides us with a next generation productivity solution, and ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Krux Digital, Inc., which provides us with a data management platform. ##TABLE_END Prior to this acquisition activity, our most significant acquisition was ExactTarget, Inc. in fiscal 2014. Technology, Development and Operations We deliver our Salesforce solutions as highly scalable, cloud computing application and platform services on a multi-tenant technology architecture. Multi-tenancy is an architectural approach that allows us to operate a single application instance for multiple organizations, treating all customers as separate tenants who run in virtual isolation from each other. Customers can use and customize an application as though they each have a separate instance, and their data and customizations remain secure and insulated from the activities of all other tenants. Our multi-tenant services run on a single stack of hardware and software, which is comprised of commercially available hardware and a combination of proprietary and commercially available software. As a result, we are able to spread the cost of delivering our services across our user base. In addition, because we do not have to manage thousands of distinct applications with their own business logic and database schemas, we believe that we can scale our business faster than traditional software vendors. Moreover, we can focus our resources on building new functionality to deliver to our customer base as a whole rather than on maintaining an infrastructure to support each of their distinct applications. Multi-tenancy also allows for faster bug and security fixes, automatic software updates and the ability to deploy major releases and frequent, incremental improvements to our services, benefiting the entire user community. Our services are optimized to run on specific databases and operating systems using the tools and platforms best suited to serve our customers rather than on-premise software that must be written to the different hardware, operating systems and database platforms existing within a customers unique systems environment. Our developers build and support solutions and features on a single code base on our chosen technology platform. Our efforts are focused on improving and enhancing the features, functionality, performance, availability and security of our existing service offerings as well as developing new features, functionality and services. From time to time, we supplement our internal research and development activities with outside development resources and acquired technology. As part of our business strategy, we periodically acquire companies or technologies, and we incorporate the acquired technologies into our solutions. Performance, functional depth, security and the usability of our solutions influence our technology decisions and product direction. Our customers access our services over the Internet via all of the major Internet browsers and on most major mobile device operating systems. We provide the majority of our services to our customers from infrastructure operated by us but secured within third-party data center hosting facilities located in the United States and other countries. These third-party data center providers provide space, physical security, continuous power and cooling. The remainder of our services operate from cloud computing platform providers who offer Infrastructure as a Service, including servers, storage, databases and networking. Sources of Revenue All of the cloud offerings that we offer to customers are grouped into four major core cloud service offerings: Sales Cloud, Service Cloud, Salesforce Platform and Other, and Marketing Cloud. Our subscription and support revenues are disaggregated into these four core offerings. For a more detailed discussion, see the Revenue by Cloud Service Offering discussion in Managements Discussion and Analysis. We derive our revenues primarily from subscription fees for our service. We also derive revenues from premier support, which provides customers with additional support beyond the standard support that is included in the basic subscription fee. We recognize subscription and support revenue ratably over the contract term, beginning on the commencement date of each contract. We enter into professional services contracts that are on a time and materials, fixed fee or subscription basis. We recognize revenue as the services are rendered for time and materials contracts, when the milestones are achieved and accepted by the customer or on a proportional performance basis for fixed price contracts and ratably over the contract term for subscription professional services. Amounts that have been invoiced are recorded in accounts receivable and in deferred revenue or revenue, depending on whether the revenue recognition criteria have been met. Deferred revenue primarily consists of billings or payments received in advance of revenue recognition from subscription services described above and is recognized as the revenue recognition criteria are met. Unbilled deferred revenue represents future billings under our subscription agreements that have not been invoiced and, accordingly, are not recorded in deferred revenue. We generally invoice customers in annual installments. Deferred revenue and unbilled deferred revenue are influenced by several factors, including new business seasonality within the year, the specific timing, size and duration of large customer subscription agreements, the timing and compounding effects of customer renewals, varying billing cycles of subscription agreements, invoice timing, foreign currency fluctuations and new business linearity within the quarter. Customers We sell to businesses of all sizes and in almost every industry worldwide. The number of paying subscriptions at each of our customers ranges from one to hundreds of thousands. None of our customers accounted for more than five percent of our revenues in fiscal 2017 , 2016 or 2015 . Sales, Marketing and Customer Support We organize our sales and marketing programs by geographic regions, such as the Americas, Europe and Asia Pacific, which includes Japan. The majority of our revenue from the Americas is attributable to customers in the United States. Approximately 26 percent of our revenue comes from customers outside of the Americas. Direct Sales We sell our services primarily through our direct sales force, which is comprised of telephone sales personnel based in regional hubs, and field sales personnel based in territories close to their customers. Both our telephone sales and field sales personnel are supported by sales representatives, who are primarily responsible for generating qualified sales leads. Referral and Indirect Sales We have a network of partners who refer sales leads to us and who then assist in selling to these prospects. This network includes global consulting firms, systems integrators and other partners. In return, we typically pay these partners a fee based on the first-year subscription revenue generated by the customers whom they refer. We continue to invest in developing additional distribution channels for our subscription service. Strategic Investments Since 2009, we have been investing in early-to-late stage technology and professional cloud service companies across the globe to support our key business initiatives, which include, among other things, extending the capabilities of our platform and CRM offerings, increasing the ecosystem of enterprise cloud companies and partners, accelerating the adoption of cloud technologies and creating the next-generation of mobile applications and connected products. Our minority investments in over 180 companies as of January 31, 2017 also help us stay connected with the pace of innovation that is currently occurring within the technology industry. In some cases, we have acquired companies in which we have previously invested. Because of the inherent risk in investing in early-to-late stage technology companies, our individual investments are subject to a risk of partial or total loss of investment capital. Marketing Our marketing strategy is to promote our brand and generate demand for our offerings. We use a variety of marketing programs across traditional and social channels to target our prospective and current customers, partners and developers. We focus our marketing activities on the cities and countries with the largest market opportunity. Our primary marketing activities include: ##TABLE_START  Multi-channel marketing campaigns that span email, social, web and more that align to a broader customer journey; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Proprietary events of all sizes, ranging from Dreamforce to salon dinners, as well as participation in trade shows and industry events, to create customer and prospect awareness; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Press and industry analyst relations to garner third-party validation and generate positive coverage for our company, offerings and value proposition; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Content marketing and engagement on all of the major social channels; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Search engine marketing and advertising to drive traffic to our Web properties; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Partner co-marketing activities with global and regional implementation partners; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Web site development to engage and educate prospects and generate interest through product information and demonstrations, case studies, white papers and marketing collateral; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Customer testimonials; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Tools that enable our sales organization to more effectively convert leads into customers; and ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Event sponsorships and primary real estate signage. ##TABLE_END Customer Service and Support Our global customer support group responds to both business and technical inquiries about the use of our products via the web, telephone, email, social networks and other channels. We provide standard customer support during regular business hours at no charge to customers who purchase any of our paying subscription editions. We also offer premier customer support that is either included in a premium offering or sold for an additional fee, which can include services such as priority access to technical resources, developer support, and system administration. In addition, we offer a mission critical support add-on that is designed to provide customers with responses for incidents from a dedicated team knowledgeable about the customer's specific enterprise architecture, and which offers instruction to optimize their usage of our products. Seasonality Our fourth quarter has historically been our strongest quarter for new business and renewals, and our first quarter is our largest collections and operating cash flow quarter. For a more detailed discussion, see the Seasonal Nature of Deferred Revenue and Accounts Receivable discussion in Managements Discussion and Analysis. Competition The market for our service offerings is highly competitive, rapidly evolving and fragmented, and subject to changing technology, shifting customer needs and frequent introductions of new products and services. Many prospective customers have invested substantial personnel and financial resources to implement and integrate their current enterprise software into their businesses and therefore may be reluctant or unwilling to migrate away from their current solution to an enterprise cloud computing application service. Additionally, third-party developers may be reluctant to build application services on our platform since they have invested in other competing technology platforms. We compete primarily with generalized platforms and vendors of packaged business software, as well as companies offering enterprise apps, including CRM, collaboration, e-commerce and business intelligence software. We also compete with internally developed apps. We may encounter competition from established enterprise software vendors, as well as start-up and midsized companies focused on disruption, who may develop toolsets and products that allow customers to build new apps that run on the customers current infrastructure or as hosted services. Our current competitors include: ##TABLE_START  On-premises offerings from enterprise software application vendors; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Cloud computing application service providers, either individually or with others; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Marketing vendors, which may be specialized in advertising, targeting, messaging, or campaign automation; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Software companies that provide their product or service free of charge, and only charge a premium for advanced features and functionality; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Traditional platform development environment companies; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Cloud computing development platform companies; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Internally developed applications (by our potential customers IT departments); ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  IoT platforms from large companies that have existing relationships with hardware and software companies; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  E-commerce solutions from emerging cloud-only vendors and established on-premises vendors; and ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Artificial intelligence solutions from new startups and established companies. ##TABLE_END We believe that as traditional enterprise software application and platform vendors shift more of their focus to cloud computing, they may become a greater competitive threat. Intellectual Property We rely on a combination of trademark, copyright, trade secret and patent laws in the United States and other jurisdictions as well as confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions to protect our proprietary technology and our brands and maintain programs to protect and grow our rights. We also enter into confidentiality and proprietary rights agreements with our employees, consultants and other third parties and control access to software, services, documentation and other proprietary information. We believe the duration of our patents is adequate relative to the expected lives of our service offerings. We also purchase or license technology that we incorporate into our products or services. At times, we make select intellectual property broadly available at no or low cost to achieve a strategic objective, such as promoting industry standards, advancing interoperability, fostering open source software or attracting and enabling our external development community. While it may be necessary in the future to seek or renew licenses relating to various aspects of our products and business methods, we believe, based upon past experience and industry practice, such licenses generally could be obtained on commercially reasonable terms. We believe our continuing research and product development are not materially dependent on any single license or other agreement with a third party relating to the development of our products. Employees As of January 31, 2017 , we had more than 25,000 employees. None of our employees in the United States are represented by a labor union, however, for certain foreign subsidiaries, workers councils represent our employees.

RISK FACTORS ##TABLE_END The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones facing us. Other events that we do not currently anticipate or that we currently deem immaterial also may affect our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. Risks Related to Our Business and Industry If our security measures or those of our third-party data center hosting facilities, cloud computing platform providers, or third-party service partners, are breached, and unauthorized access is obtained to a customers data, our data or our IT systems, our services may be perceived as not being secure, customers may curtail or stop using our services, and we may incur significant legal and financial exposure and liabilities. Our services involve the storage and transmission of our customers and our customers' customers' proprietary and other sensitive data, including financial information and other personally identifiable information. Security breaches could expose us to a risk of loss of this information, litigation and possible liability. While we have security measures in place, they may be breached as a result of third-party action, including intentional misconduct by computer hackers, employee error, malfeasance or otherwise and result in someone obtaining unauthorized access to our IT systems, our customers data or our data, including our intellectual property and other confidential business information. Additionally, third parties may attempt to fraudulently induce employees or customers into disclosing sensitive information such as user names, passwords or other information in order to gain access to our customers data, our data or our IT systems. Because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access, or to sabotage systems, change frequently and generally are not recognized until launched against a target, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures. In addition, our customers may authorize third-party technology providers to access their customer data, and some of our customers may not have adequate security measures in place to protect their data that is stored on our services. Because we do not control our customers or third-party technology providers, or the processing of such data by third-party technology providers, we cannot ensure the integrity or security of such transmissions or processing. Malicious third parties may also conduct attacks designed to temporarily deny customers access to our services. Any security breach could result in a loss of confidence in the security of our services, damage our reputation, negatively impact our future sales, disrupt our business and lead to legal liability. Defects or disruptions in our services could diminish demand for our services and subject us to substantial liability. Because our services are complex and incorporate a variety of hardware and proprietary and third-party software, our services may have errors or defects that could result in unanticipated downtime for our subscribers and harm to our reputation and our business. Cloud services frequently contain undetected errors when first introduced or when new versions or enhancements are released. We have from time to time found defects in, and experienced disruptions to, our services and new defects or disruptions may occur in the future. In addition, our customers may use our services in unanticipated ways that may cause a disruption in services for other customers attempting to access their data. As we acquire companies, we may encounter difficulty in incorporating the acquired technologies into our services and in augmenting the technologies to meet the quality standards that are consistent with our brand and reputation. Since our customers use our services for important aspects of their business, any errors, defects, disruptions in service or other performance problems could hurt our reputation and may damage our customers businesses. As a result, customers could elect to not renew our services or delay or withhold payment to us. We could also lose future sales or customers may make warranty or other claims against us, which could result in an increase in our provision for doubtful accounts, an increase in collection cycles for accounts receivable or the expense and risk of litigation. Interruptions or delays in services from our third-party data center hosting facilities or cloud computing platform providers could impair the delivery of our services and harm our business. We currently serve our customers from third-party data center hosting facilities and cloud computing platform providers located in the United States and other countries. We rely on computer hardware purchased or leased from, software licensed from, and cloud computing platforms provided by, third parties in order to offer our services, including database software and hardware from a variety of vendors. Any damage to, or failure of our systems generally, including the systems of our third-party platform providers, could result in interruptions in our services. We have from time to time experienced interruptions in our services and such interruptions may occur in the future. Interruptions in our services may reduce our revenue, cause us to issue credits or pay penalties, cause customers to terminate their subscriptions and adversely affect our attrition rates and our ability to attract new customers, all of which would reduce our revenue. Our business would also be harmed if our customers and potential customers believe our services are unreliable. As part of our current disaster recovery and business continuity arrangements, our production environment and all of our customers data are currently replicated in near real-time in a separate facility located elsewhere. Companies and products added through acquisition may be served through alternate facilities. We do not control the operation of any of these facilities, and they may be vulnerable to damage or interruption from earthquakes, floods, fires, power loss, telecommunications failures and similar events. They may also be subject to break-ins, sabotage, intentional acts of vandalism and similar misconduct, as well as local administrative actions, changes to legal or permitting requirements and litigation to stop, limit or delay operation. Despite precautions taken at these facilities, such as disaster recovery and business continuity arrangements, the occurrence of a natural disaster or an act of terrorism, a decision to close the facilities without adequate notice or other unanticipated problems at these facilities could result in lengthy interruptions in our services. These hardware, software and cloud computing platforms may not continue to be available at reasonable prices, on commercially reasonable terms or at all. Any loss of the right to use any of these hardware, software or cloud computing platforms could significantly increase our expenses and otherwise result in delays in the provisioning of our services until equivalent technology is either developed by us, or, if available, is identified, obtained through purchase or license and integrated into our services. If we do not accurately plan for our infrastructure capacity requirements and we experience significant strains on our data center capacity, our customers could experience performance degradation or service outages that may subject us to financial liabilities, result in customer losses and harm our business. When we add data centers and add capacity, we may move or transfer our data and our customers data. Despite precautions taken during this process, any unsuccessful data transfers may impair the delivery of our services, which may damage our business. Our ability to deliver our services is dependent on the development and maintenance of the infrastructure of the Internet by third parties. The Internets infrastructure is comprised of many different networks and services that are highly fragmented and distributed by design. This infrastructure is run by a series of independent third party organizations that work together to provide the infrastructure and supporting services of the Internet under the governance of the Internet Corporation for Assigned Numbers and Names (ICANN) and the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA), now under the stewardship of ICANN. The Internet has experienced a variety of outages and other delays as a result of damages to portions of its infrastructure, denial-of-service attacks or related cyber incidents, and it could face outages and delays in the future. These outages and delays could reduce the level of Internet usage or result in fragmentation of the Internet, resulting in multiple separate Internets. These scenarios are not under our control and could reduce the availability of the Internet to us or our customers for delivery of our Internet-based services. Any resulting interruptions in our services or the ability of our customers to access our services could result in a loss of potential or existing customers and harm our business. Privacy concerns and laws, evolving regulation of cloud computing, cross-border data transfer restrictions and other domestic or foreign regulations may limit the use and adoption of our services and adversely affect our business. Regulation related to the provision of services on the Internet is increasing, as federal, state and foreign governments continue to adopt new laws and regulations addressing data privacy and the collection, processing, storage and use of personal information. In some cases, foreign data privacy laws and regulations, such as the European Unions Data Protection Directive, and the country-specific laws and regulations that implement that directive, also govern the processing of personal information. Further, laws are increasingly aimed at the use of personal information for marketing purposes, such as the European Unions e-Privacy Directive, and the country-specific regulations that implement that directive. Such laws and regulations are subject to new and differing interpretations and may be inconsistent among jurisdictions. These and other requirements could reduce demand for our services or restrict our ability to store and process data or, in some cases, impact our ability to offer our services in certain locations or our customers' ability to deploy our solutions globally. For example, in October 2015, the European Court of Justice invalidated the U.S.-EU Safe Harbor framework that had been in place since 2000, which allowed companies to meet certain European legal requirements for the transfer of personal data from the European Economic Area to the United States. While other adequate legal mechanisms to lawfully transfer such data remain, the invalidation of the U.S.-EU Safe Harbor framework may result in different European data protection regulators applying differing standards for the transfer of personal data, which could result in increased regulation, cost of compliance and limitations on data transfer for us and our customers. The costs of compliance with and other burdens imposed by laws, regulations and standards may limit the use and adoption of our services, reduce overall demand for our services, lead to significant fines, penalties or liabilities for noncompliance, or slow the pace at which we close sales transactions, any of which could harm our business. In addition to government activity, privacy advocacy and other industry groups have established or may establish new self-regulatory standards that may place additional burdens on us. Our customers expect us to meet voluntary certification or other standards established by third parties, such as TRUSTe. If we are unable to maintain these certifications or meet these standards, it could adversely affect our ability to provide our solutions to certain customers and could harm our business. Furthermore, concerns regarding data privacy may cause our customers customers to resist providing the data necessary to allow our customers to use our services effectively. Even the perception that the privacy of personal information is not satisfactorily protected or does not meet regulatory requirements could inhibit sales of our products or services, and could limit adoption of our cloud-based solutions. Industry-specific regulation and other requirements and standards are evolving and unfavorable industry-specific laws, regulations, interpretive positions or standards could harm our business. Our customers and potential customers conduct business in a variety of industries, including financial services, the public sector, healthcare and telecommunications. Regulators in certain industries have adopted and may in the future adopt regulations or interpretive positions regarding the use of cloud computing and other outsourced services. The costs of compliance with, and other burdens imposed by, industry-specific laws, regulations and interpretive positions may limit our customers use and adoption of our services and reduce overall demand for our services. Compliance with these regulations may also require us to devote greater resources to support certain customers, which may increase costs and lengthen sales cycles. For example, some financial services regulators have imposed guidelines for use of cloud computing services that mandate specific controls or require financial services enterprises to obtain regulatory approval prior to outsourcing certain functions. If we are unable to comply with these guidelines or controls, or if our customers are unable to obtain regulatory approval to use our services where required, our business may be harmed. In addition, an inability to satisfy the standards of certain voluntary third-party certification bodies that our customers may expect, such as an attestation of compliance with the Payment Card Industry (PCI) Data Security Standards, may have an adverse impact on our business and results. Further, there are various statutes, regulations, and rulings relevant to the direct email marketing and text-messaging industries, including the Telephone Consumer Protection Act (TCPA) and related Federal Communication Commission (FCC) orders. The interpretation of many of these statutes, regulations, and rulings is evolving in the courts and administrative agencies and an inability to comply may have an adverse impact on our business and results. If in the future we are unable to achieve or maintain industry-specific certifications or other requirements or standards relevant to our customers, it may harm our business and adversely affect our results. In some cases, industry-specific laws, regulations or interpretive positions may also apply directly to us as a service provider. Any failure or perceived failure by us to comply with such requirements could have an adverse impact on our business. The market in which we participate is intensely competitive, and if we do not compete effectively, our operating results could be harmed. The market for enterprise applications and platform services is highly competitive, rapidly evolving and fragmented, and subject to changing technology, shifting customer needs and frequent introductions of new products and services. We compete primarily with generalized platforms and vendors of packaged business software, as well as companies offering enterprise apps, including CRM, collaboration, e-commerce and business intelligence software. We also compete with internally developed apps and face competition from enterprise software vendors and online service providers who may develop toolsets and products that allow customers to build new applications that run on the customers current infrastructure or as hosted services. Our current competitors include: ##TABLE_START  On-premises offerings from enterprise software application vendors; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Cloud computing application service providers, either individually or with others; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Marketing vendors, which may be specialized in advertising, targeting, messaging, or campaign automation; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Software companies that provide their product or service free of charge, and only charge a premium for advanced features and functionality; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Traditional platform development environment companies; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Cloud computing development platform companies; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Internally developed applications (by our potential customers IT departments); ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  IoT platforms from large companies that have existing relationships with hardware and software companies; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  E-commerce solutions from emerging cloud-only vendors and established on-premises vendors; and ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Artificial intelligence solutions from new startups and established companies. ##TABLE_END Many of our current and potential competitors enjoy substantial competitive advantages, such as greater name recognition, longer operating histories and larger marketing budgets, as well as substantially greater financial, technical and other resources. In addition, many of our current and potential competitors have established marketing relationships and access to larger customer bases, and have major distribution agreements with consultants, system integrators and resellers. As a result, our competitors may be able to respond more quickly and effectively than we can to new or changing opportunities, technologies, standards or customer requirements. Furthermore, because of these advantages, even if our services are more effective than the products and services that our competitors offer, potential customers might select competitive products and services in lieu of purchasing our services. For all of these reasons, we may not be able to compete successfully against our current and future competitors. As we acquire and invest in companies or technologies, we may not realize the expected business or financial benefits and the acquisitions could prove difficult to integrate, disrupt our business, dilute stockholder value and adversely affect our operating results and the market value of our common stock. As part of our business strategy, we periodically make investments in, or acquisitions of, complementary businesses, joint ventures, services and technologies and intellectual property rights, and we expect that we will continue to make such investments and acquisitions in the future. Acquisitions and investments involve numerous risks, including:  potential failure to achieve the expected benefits of the combination or acquisition;  difficulties in, and the cost of, integrating operations, technologies, services, platforms and personnel;  diversion of financial and managerial resources from existing operations; ##TABLE_START  the potential entry into new markets in which we have little or no experience or where competitors may have stronger market positions; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  potential write-offs of acquired assets or investments, and potential financial and credit risks associated with acquired customers; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  potential loss of key employees of the acquired company; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  inability to generate sufficient revenue to offset acquisition or investment costs; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  inability to maintain relationships with customers and partners of the acquired business; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  difficulty of transitioning the acquired technology onto our existing platforms and customer acceptance of multiple platforms on a temporary or permanent basis; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  augmenting the acquired technologies and platforms to the levels that are consistent with our brand and reputation; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  increasing or maintaining the security standards for acquired technology consistent with our other services; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  potential unknown liabilities associated with the acquired businesses; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  unanticipated expenses related to acquired technology and its integration into our existing technology; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  negative impact to our results of operations because of the depreciation and amortization of amounts related to acquired intangible assets, fixed assets and deferred compensation; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  additional stock based compensation; the loss of acquired deferred revenue and unbilled deferred revenue; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  delays in customer purchases due to uncertainty related to any acquisition; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  ineffective or inadequate controls, procedures and policies at the acquired company may negatively impact our results of operations; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  challenges caused by integrating operations over distance, and across different languages and cultures; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  currency and regulatory risks associated with foreign countries and potential additional cybersecurity and compliance risks resulting from entry into new markets; and ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  the tax effects of any such acquisitions. ##TABLE_END Any of these risks could harm our business. In addition, to facilitate these acquisitions or investments, we may seek additional equity or debt financing, which may not be available on terms favorable to us or at all, which may affect our ability to complete subsequent acquisitions or investments, and which may affect the risks of owning our common stock. For example, if we finance acquisitions by issuing equity or convertible or other debt securities or loans, our existing stockholders may be diluted, or we could face constraints related to the terms of, and repayment obligation related to, the incurrence of indebtedness that could affect the market price of our common stock. We are subject to risks associated with our strategic investments. Other-than-temporary impairments in the value of our investments could negatively impact our financial results. We invest in early-to-late stage companies for strategic reasons and to support key business initiatives, and may not realize a return on our strategic investments. Many such companies generate net losses and the market for their products, services or technologies may be slow to develop, and, therefore, are dependent on the availability of later rounds of financing from banks or investors on favorable terms to continue their operations. The financial success of our investment in any company is typically dependent on a liquidity event, such as a public offering, acquisition or other favorable market event reflecting appreciation to the cost of our initial investment. The capital markets for public offerings and acquisitions are dynamic and the likelihood of liquidity events for the companies we have invested in could significantly worsen. Further, valuations of privately-held companies are inherently complex due to the lack of readily available market data. If we determine that any of our investments in such companies have experienced a decline in value, we may be required to record an other than temporary impairment, which could be material. We have in the past written off the full value of specific investments. Similar situations could occur in the future and negatively impact our financial results. All of our investments are subject to a risk of a partial or total loss of investment capital. Our quarterly results are likely to fluctuate and our stock price and the value of our common stock could decline substantially. Our quarterly results are likely to fluctuate. For example, our fiscal fourth quarter has historically been our strongest quarter for new business and renewals. The year-over-year compounding effect of this seasonality in billing patterns and overall new business and renewal activity causes the value of invoices that we generate in the fourth quarter to continually increase in proportion to our billings in the other three quarters of our fiscal year. As a result, our fiscal first quarter is our largest collections and operating cash flow quarter. Additionally, some of the important factors that may cause our revenues, operating results and cash flows to fluctuate from quarter to quarter include: ##TABLE_START  our ability to retain and increase sales to existing customers, attract new customers and satisfy our customers requirements; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  the attrition rates for our services; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  the amount and timing of operating costs and capital expenditures related to the operations and expansion of our business; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  changes in deferred revenue and unbilled deferred revenue balances, which are not reflected in the balance sheet, due to seasonality, the compounding effects of renewals, invoice duration, size and timing, new business linearity between quarters and within a quarter and fluctuations due to foreign currency movements; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  the seasonality of our customers businesses, especially Commerce Cloud customers, including retailers and branded manufacturers; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  changes in foreign currency exchange rates such as with respect to the British Pound; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  variations in the revenue mix of our services and growth rates of our cloud subscription and support offerings; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  the number of new employees; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  changes in our pricing policies and terms of contracts, whether initiated by us or as a result of competition; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  the cost, timing and management effort for the introduction of new features to our services; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  the costs associated with acquiring new businesses and technologies and the follow-on costs of integration and consolidating the results of acquired businesses; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  the rate of expansion and productivity of our sales force; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  the length of the sales cycle for our services; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  new product and service introductions by our competitors; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  our success in selling our services to large enterprises; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  evolving regulations of cloud computing and cross-border data transfer restrictions and similar regulations; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  technical difficulties or interruptions in our services; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  expenses related to our real estate, our office leases and our data center capacity and expansion; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  changes in interest rates and our mix of investments, which would impact the return on our investments in cash and marketable securities; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  conditions, particularly sudden changes, in the financial markets, which have impacted and may continue to impact the value of and liquidity of our investment portfolio; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  income tax effects; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  our ability to realize benefits from strategic partnerships, acquisitions or investments; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  other than temporary impairments in the value of our strategic investments in early-to-late stage privately held companies, which could be material in a particular quarter; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  expenses related to significant, unusual or discrete events, which are recorded in the period in which the events occur; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  general economic conditions, which may adversely affect either our customers ability or willingness to purchase additional subscriptions or upgrade their services, or delay a prospective customer's purchasing decision, reduce the value of new subscription contracts, or affect attrition rates; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  timing of additional investments in our enterprise cloud computing application and platform services and in our consulting services; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  regulatory compliance costs; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  changes in payment terms and the timing of customer payments and payment defaults by customers; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  extraordinary expenses such as litigation or other dispute-related settlement payments; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  the impact of new accounting pronouncements, for example, the adoption of Accounting Standards Update No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) (ASU 2014-09), the new revenue recognition standard; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  equity issuances, including as consideration in acquisitions or due to the conversion of our outstanding convertible notes at the election of the note holders; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  the timing of stock awards to employees and the related adverse financial statement impact of having to expense those stock awards on a straight-line basis over their vesting schedules; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  the timing of commission, bonus, and other compensation payments to employees; and ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  the timing of payroll and other withholding tax expenses, which are triggered by the payment of bonuses and when employees exercise their vested stock awards. ##TABLE_END Many of these factors are outside of our control, and the occurrence of one or more of them might cause our operating results to vary widely. As such, we believe that historical quarter-to-quarter comparisons of our revenues, operating results, changes in our deferred revenue and unbilled deferred revenue balances and cash flows may not be meaningful and should not be relied upon as an indication of future performance. Additionally, if we fail to meet or exceed the expectations of securities analysts and investors, or if one or more of the securities analysts who cover us adversely change their recommendation regarding our stock, the market price of our common stock could decline. Moreover, our stock price may be based on expectations, estimates and forecasts of our future performance that may be unrealistic or that may not be met. Further, our stock price may fluctuate based on reporting by the financial media, including television, radio and press reports and blogs. If we experience significant fluctuations in our rate of anticipated growth and fail to balance our expenses with our revenue forecasts, our results could be harmed. Due to the pace of change and innovation in enterprise cloud computing services, the unpredictability of future general economic and financial market conditions and the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, we may not be able to accurately forecast our rate of growth. We plan our expense levels and investment on estimates of future revenue and future anticipated rate of growth. We may not be able to adjust our spending appropriately if the addition of new subscriptions or the renewals of existing subscriptions fall short of our expectations. A portion of our expenses may also be fixed in nature for some minimum amount of time, such as with a data center contract or office lease, so it may not be possible to reduce costs in a timely manner or without the payment of fees to exit certain obligations early. As a result, we expect that our revenues, operating results and cash flows may fluctuate significantly on a quarterly basis. Our recent revenue growth rates may not be sustainable and may decline in the future. We believe that historical period-to-period comparisons of our revenues, operating results and cash flows may not be meaningful and should not be relied upon as an indication of future performance. Our efforts to expand our services beyond the CRM market and to develop our existing services in order to keep pace with technological developments may not succeed and may reduce our revenue growth rate and harm our business. We derive substantially all of our revenue from subscriptions to our CRM enterprise cloud computing application services, and we expect this will continue for the foreseeable future. The markets for our Analytics, Community, IoT, Commerce and Salesforce Quip Clouds remain relatively new and it is uncertain whether our efforts will ever result in significant revenue for us. Commerce Cloud originated as part of our Demandware acquisition and Salesforce Quip originated from our acquisition of Quip. Further, the introduction of significant platform changes and upgrades, including our conversion to our new Lightning platform, and introduction of new services beyond the CRM market, may not be successful, and early stage interest and adoption of such new services may not result in long term success or significant revenue for us. Our efforts to expand our services beyond the CRM market may not succeed and may reduce our revenue growth rate. Additionally, if we are unable to develop enhancements to and new features for our existing or new services that keep pace with rapid technological developments, our business will be harmed. The success of enhancements, new features and services depends on several factors, including the timely completion, introduction and market acceptance of the feature, service or enhancement. Failure in this regard may significantly impair our revenue growth. In addition, because our services are designed to operate on a variety of network hardware and software platforms using a standard browser, we will need to continuously modify and enhance our services to keep pace with changes in Internet-related hardware, software, communication, browser and database technologies. We may not be successful in either developing these modifications and enhancements or in bringing them to market timely. Furthermore, uncertainties about the timing and nature of new network platforms or technologies, or modifications to existing platforms or technologies, could increase our research and development or service delivery expenses. Any failure of our services to operate effectively with future network platforms and technologies could reduce the demand for our services, result in customer dissatisfaction and harm our business. Additionally, if we fail to anticipate or identify significant Internet-related and other technology trends and developments early enough, or if we do not devote appropriate resources to adapting to such trends and developments, our business could be harmed. Sales to customers outside the United States expose us to risks inherent in international operations. We sell our services throughout the world and are subject to risks and challenges associated with international business. Historically, sales in Europe and Asia Pacific together have represented less than 30 percent of our total revenues, and we intend to continue to expand our international sales efforts. The risks and challenges associated with sales to customers outside the United States, as well as international operations generally, include: ##TABLE_START  localization of our services, including translation into foreign languages and associated expenses; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  laws and business practices favoring local competitors; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  pressure on the creditworthiness of sovereign nations, particularly in Europe, where we have customers and a balance of our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  liquidity issues or political actions by sovereign nations, which could result in decreased values of these balances or potential difficulties protecting our foreign assets or satisfying local obligations; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  foreign currency fluctuations and controls; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  compliance with multiple, conflicting and changing governmental laws and regulations, including employment, tax, privacy, anti-corruption, import/export, antitrust, data transfer, storage and protection, and industry-specific laws and regulations, including rules related to compliance by our third-party resellers; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  regional data privacy laws and other regulatory requirements that apply to outsourced service providers and to the transmission of our customers data across international borders; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  treatment of revenue from international sources and changes to tax codes, including being subject to foreign tax laws and being liable for paying withholding income or other taxes in foreign jurisdictions; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  different pricing environments; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  different or lesser protection of our intellectual property; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  longer accounts receivable payment cycles and other collection difficulties; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  natural disasters, acts of war, terrorism, pandemics or security breaches; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  tax policies addressing multinational operations; and ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  regional economic and political conditions. ##TABLE_END Any of these factors could negatively impact our business and results of operations. The above factors may also negatively impact our ability to successfully expand into emerging market countries, where we have little or no operating experience, where it can be costly and challenging to establish and maintain operations, including hiring and managing required personnel, and difficult to promote our brand, and where we may not benefit from any first-to-market advantage or otherwise succeed. Additionally, our international subscription fees are paid either in U.S. Dollars or local currency. As a result, fluctuations in the value of the U.S. Dollar and foreign currencies may make our services more expensive for international customers, which could harm our business. Because we recognize revenue from subscriptions for our services over the term of the subscription, downturns or upturns in new business may not be immediately reflected in our operating results. We generally recognize revenue from customers ratably over the terms of their subscription agreements, which are typically 12 to 36 months. As a result, most of the revenue we report in each quarter is the result of subscription agreements entered into during previous quarters. Consequently, a decline in new or renewed subscriptions in any one quarter may not be reflected in our revenue results for that quarter. Any such decline, however, will negatively affect our revenue in future quarters. Accordingly, the effect of significant downturns in sales and market acceptance of our services, and potential changes in our attrition rate, may not be fully reflected in our results of operations until future periods. Our subscription model also makes it difficult for us to rapidly increase our revenue through additional sales in any period, as revenue from new customers must be recognized over the applicable subscription term.  If our customers do not renew their subscriptions for our services or reduce the number of paying subscriptions at the time of renewal, our revenue will decline and our business will suffer. If we cannot accurately predict subscription renewals or upgrade rates, we may not meet our revenue targets, which may adversely affect the market price of our common stock. Our customers have no obligation to renew their subscriptions for our services after the expiration of their contractual subscription period, which is typically 12 to 36 months, and in the normal course of business, some customers have elected not to renew. In addition, our customers may renew for fewer subscriptions, renew for shorter contract lengths, or switch to lower cost offerings of our services. It is difficult to predict attrition rates given our varied customer base of enterprise and small and medium size business customers and the number of multi-year subscription contracts. Our attrition rates may increase or fluctuate as a result of a number of factors, including customer dissatisfaction with our services, customers spending levels, decreases in the number of users at our customers, competition, pricing increases or changes and deteriorating general economic conditions. Our future success also depends in part on our ability to sell additional features and services, more subscriptions or enhanced editions of our services to our current customers. This may also require increasingly sophisticated and costly sales efforts that are targeted at senior management. Similarly, the rate at which our customers purchase new or enhanced services depends on a number of factors, including general economic conditions and that our customers do not react negatively to any price changes related to these additional features and services. If our efforts to upsell to our customers are not successful our business may suffer. If the market for our technology delivery model and enterprise cloud computing services develops more slowly than we expect, our business could be harmed. Our success depends on the willingness of third-party developers to build applications that are complementary to our services. Without the development of these applications, both current and potential customers may not find our services sufficiently attractive. In addition, for those customers who authorize a third-party technology partner access to their data, we do not provide any warranty related to the functionality, security and integrity of the data transmission or processing. Despite contract provisions to protect us, customers may look to us to support and provide warranties for the third-party applications, which may expose us to potential claims, liabilities and obligations for applications we did not develop or sell, all of which could harm our business. We are exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates that could negatively impact our financial results and cash flows from changes in the value of the U.S. Dollar versus local currencies. We conduct our business in the following locations: United States, Europe, Canada, Asia, South America and Australia. The expanding global scope of our business exposes us to risk of fluctuations in foreign currency markets. This exposure is the result of selling in multiple currencies, growth in our international investments, including data center expansion, additional headcount in foreign locations, and operating in countries where the functional currency is the local currency. Specifically, our results of operations and cash flows are subject to fluctuations primarily in British Pound Sterling, the Euro and Japanese Yen against the U.S. Dollar. These exposures may change over time as business practices evolve and economic conditions change. The fluctuations of currencies in which we conduct business can both increase and decrease our overall revenue and expenses for any given fiscal period. Such volatility, even when it increases our revenues or decreases our expenses, impacts our ability to accurately predict our future results and earnings. Recent events, including the United Kingdoms 2016 vote in favor of exiting the European Union, or Brexit, and similar geopolitical developments and uncertainty in the European Union and elsewhere could amplify the volatility of currency fluctuations and related risks for our business. Supporting our existing and growing customer base could strain our personnel resources and infrastructure, and if we are unable to scale our operations and increase productivity, we may not be able to successfully implement our business plan. We continue to experience significant growth in our customer base and personnel, which has placed a strain on our management, administrative, operational and financial infrastructure. We anticipate that additional investments in our internal infrastructure, data center capacity, research, customer support and development, and real estate spending will be required to scale our operations and increase productivity, to address the needs of our customers, to further develop and enhance our services, to expand into new geographic areas, and to scale with our overall growth. The additional investments we are making will increase our cost base, which will make it more difficult for us to offset any future revenue shortfalls by reducing expenses in the short term. We regularly upgrade or replace our various software systems. If the implementations of these new applications are delayed, or if we encounter unforeseen problems with our new systems or in migrating away from our existing applications and systems, our operations and our ability to manage our business could be negatively impacted. Our success will depend in part upon the ability of our senior management to manage our projected growth effectively. To do so, we must continue to increase the productivity of our existing employees and to hire, train and manage new employees as needed. To manage the expected domestic and international growth of our operations and personnel, we will need to continue to improve our operational, financial and management controls, our reporting systems and procedures, and our utilization of real estate. If we fail to successfully scale our operations and increase productivity, we will be unable to execute our business plan. As more of our sales efforts are targeted at larger enterprise customers, our sales cycle may become more time-consuming and expensive, we may encounter pricing pressure and implementation and customization challenges, and we may have to delay revenue recognition for some complex transactions, all of which could harm our business and operating results. As we target more of our sales efforts at larger enterprise customers, including governmental entities, we may face greater costs, longer sales cycles, greater competition and less predictability in completing some of our sales. In this market segment, the customers decision to use our services may be an enterprise-wide decision and, if so, these types of sales would require us to provide greater levels of education regarding the use and benefits of our services, as well as education regarding privacy and data protection laws and regulations to prospective customers with international operations. In addition, larger customers and governmental entities may demand more customization, integration services and features. As a result of these factors, these sales opportunities may require us to devote greater sales support and professional services resources to individual customers, driving up costs and time required to complete sales and diverting our own sales and professional services resources to a smaller number of larger transactions, while potentially requiring us to delay revenue recognition on some of these transactions until the technical or implementation requirements have been met. Pricing and packaging strategies for enterprise and other customers for subscriptions to our existing and future service offerings may not be widely accepted by other new or existing customers. Our adoption of such new pricing and packaging strategies may harm our business. For large enterprise customers, professional services may also be performed by a third party or a combination of our own staff and a third party. Our strategy is to work with third parties to increase the breadth of capability and depth of capacity for delivery of these services to our customers. If a customer is not satisfied with the quality of work performed by us or a third party or with the type of services or solutions delivered, then we could incur additional costs to address the situation, the profitability of that work might be impaired, and the customers dissatisfaction with our services could damage our ability to obtain additional work from that customer. In addition, negative publicity related to our customer relationships, regardless of its accuracy, may further damage our business by affecting our ability to compete for new business with current and prospective customers. We have been and may in the future be sued by third parties for various claims including alleged infringement of proprietary rights. We are involved in various legal matters arising from the normal course of business activities. These may include claims, suits, government investigations and other proceedings involving alleged infringement of third-party patents and other intellectual property rights, commercial, corporate and securities, labor and employment, class actions, wage and hour, and other matters. The software and Internet industries are characterized by the existence of a large number of patents, trademarks and copyrights and by frequent litigation based on allegations of infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights. We have received in the past and may receive in the future communications from third parties, including practicing entities and non-practicing entities, claiming that we have infringed their intellectual property rights. In addition, we have been, and may in the future be, sued by third parties for alleged infringement of their claimed proprietary rights. Our technologies may be subject to injunction if they are found to infringe the rights of a third party or we may be required to pay damages, or both. Further, many of our subscription agreements require us to indemnify our customers for third-party intellectual property infringement claims, which would increase the cost to us of an adverse ruling on such a claim. The outcome of any claims or litigation, regardless of the merits, is inherently uncertain. Any claims and lawsuits, and the disposition of such claims and lawsuits, whether through settlement or licensing discussions, or litigation, could be time-consuming and expensive to resolve, divert management attention from executing our business plan, result in efforts to enjoin our activities, lead to attempts on the part of other parties to pursue similar claims and, in the case of intellectual property claims, require us to change our technology, change our business practices, pay monetary damages or enter into short- or long-term royalty or licensing agreements. Any adverse determination related to intellectual property claims or other litigation could prevent us from offering our services to others, could be material to our financial condition or cash flows, or both, or could otherwise adversely affect our operating results. In addition, depending on the nature and timing of any such dispute, an unfavorable resolution of a legal matter could materially affect our current or future results of operations or cash flows in a particular quarter. In addition, our exposure to risks associated with various claims, including the use of intellectual property, may be increased as a result of acquisitions of other companies. For example, we may have a lower level of visibility into the development process with respect to intellectual property or the care taken to safeguard against infringement risks with respect to the acquired company or technology. In addition, third parties may make infringement and similar or related claims after we have acquired technology that had not been asserted prior to our acquisition. Any failure to protect our intellectual property rights could impair our ability to protect our proprietary technology and our brand. If we fail to protect our intellectual property rights adequately, our competitors may gain access to our technology, and our business may be harmed. In addition, defending our intellectual property rights may entail significant expense. Any of our patents, trademarks or other intellectual property rights may be challenged by others or invalidated through administrative process or litigation. While we have some U.S. patents and many U.S. and international patent applications pending, we may be unable to obtain patent protection for the technology covered in our patent applications or the patent protection may not be obtained quickly enough to meet our business needs. In addition, our existing patents and any patents issued in the future may not provide us with competitive advantages, or may be successfully challenged by third parties. Furthermore, legal standards relating to the validity, enforceability and scope of protection of intellectual property rights are uncertain, and we also may face proposals to change the scope of protection for some intellectual property rights in the U.S. Effective patent, trademark, copyright and trade secret protection may not be available to us in every country in which our services are available. The laws of some foreign countries may not be as protective of intellectual property rights as those in the U.S., and mechanisms for enforcement of intellectual property rights may be inadequate. Also, our involvement in standard setting activity or the need to obtain licenses from others may require us to license our intellectual property. Accordingly, despite our efforts, we may be unable to prevent third parties from using our intellectual property. We may be required to spend significant resources to monitor and protect our intellectual property rights and we may conclude that in at least some instances the benefits of protecting our intellectual property rights may be outweighed by the expense. We may initiate claims or litigation against third parties for infringement of our proprietary rights or to establish the validity of our proprietary rights. Any litigation, whether or not it is resolved in our favor, could result in significant expense to us and divert the efforts of our technical and management personnel. Our continued success depends on our ability to maintain and enhance our brands. We believe that the brand identities we have developed have significantly contributed to the success of our business. Maintaining and enhancing the Salesforce brand and our other brands are critical to expanding our base of customers, partners and employees. Our brand strength will depend largely on our ability to remain a technology leader and continue to provide high-quality innovative products, services, and features. In order to maintain and enhance our brands, we may be required to make substantial investments that may later prove to be unsuccessful. In addition, positions the Company takes on social issues may be unpopular with some customers or potential customers, which may impact our ability to attract or retain such customers. If we fail to maintain and enhance our brands, or if we incur excessive expenses in our efforts to do so, our business, operating results and financial condition may be materially and adversely affected. We may lose key members of our management team or development and operations personnel, and may be unable to attract and retain employees we need to support our operations and growth. Our success depends substantially upon the continued services of our executive officers and other key members of management, particularly our Chief Executive Officer. From time to time, there may be changes in our executive management team resulting from the hiring or departure of executives. Such changes in our executive management team may be disruptive to our business. We are also substantially dependent on the continued service of our existing development and operations personnel because of the complexity of our services and technologies. We do not have employment agreements with any of our executive officers, key management, development or operations personnel and they could terminate their employment with us at any time. The loss of one or more of our key employees or groups could seriously harm our business. In the technology industry, there is substantial and continuous competition for engineers with high levels of experience in designing, developing and managing software and Internet-related services, as well as competition for sales executives, data scientists and operations personnel. We may not be successful in attracting and retaining qualified personnel. We have from time to time experienced, and we expect to continue to experience, difficulty in hiring and retaining highly skilled employees with appropriate qualifications. These difficulties may be amplified by evolving restrictions on immigration, travel or availability of visas for skilled technology workers. If we fail to attract new personnel or fail to retain and motivate our current personnel, our business and future growth prospects could be severely harmed. In addition, we believe in the importance of our corporate culture, or Aloha spirit, which fosters dialogue, collaboration, recognition and a sense of family. As our organization grows, we may find it increasingly difficult to maintain the beneficial aspects of our corporate culture. This could negatively impact our future success. Any failure in our delivery of high-quality technical support services may adversely affect our relationships with our customers and our financial results. Our customers depend on our support organization to resolve technical issues relating to our applications. We may be unable to respond quickly enough to accommodate short-term increases in customer demand for support services. Increased customer demand for these services, without corresponding revenues, could increase costs and adversely affect our operating results. In addition, our sales process is highly dependent on our applications and business reputation and on positive recommendations from our existing customers. Any failure to maintain high-quality technical support, or a market perception that we do not maintain high-quality support, could adversely affect our reputation, our ability to sell our enterprise cloud computing solutions to existing and prospective customers, and our business, operating results and financial position. Periodic changes to our sales organization can be disruptive and may reduce our rate of growth. We periodically change and make adjustments to our sales organization in response to market opportunities, competitive threats, management changes, product introductions or enhancements, acquisitions, sales performance, increases in sales headcount, cost levels and other internal and external considerations. Any such future sales organization changes may result in a temporary reduction of productivity, which could negatively affect our rate of growth. In addition, any significant change to the way we structure our compensation of our sales organization may be disruptive and may affect our revenue growth. Unanticipated changes in our effective tax rate and additional tax liabilities may impact our financial results. We are subject to income taxes in the United States and various jurisdictions outside of the United States. Our effective tax rate could fluctuate due to changes in the mix of earnings and losses in countries with differing statutory tax rates. Our tax expense could also be impacted by changes in non-deductible expenses, changes in excess tax benefits of stock-based compensation, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities and our ability to utilize them, the applicability of withholding taxes and effects from acquisitions. We are subject to tax examinations in multiple jurisdictions. While we regularly evaluate new information that may change our judgment resulting in recognition, derecognition or change in measurement of a tax position taken, there can be no assurance that the final determination of any examinations will not have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial position. Our tax provision could also be impacted by changes in accounting principles, changes in U.S. federal and state or international tax laws applicable to corporate multinationals such as the legislation enacted in the United Kingdom and Australia, other fundamental law changes currently being considered by many countries, including the U.S., and changes in taxing jurisdictions' administrative interpretations, decisions, policies and positions. Additionally, in October 2015, the Organisation for Economic Co-Operation and Development released final guidance covering various topics, including transfer pricing, country-by-country reporting and definitional changes to permanent establishment which could ultimately impact our tax liabilities. We may also be subject to additional tax liabilities due to changes in non-income based taxes resulting from changes in federal, state or international tax laws, changes in taxing jurisdictions administrative interpretations, decisions, policies, and positions, results of tax examinations, settlements or judicial decisions, changes in accounting principles, changes to the business operations, including acquisitions, as well as the evaluation of new information that results in a change to a tax position taken in a prior period. Our debt service obligations and operating lease commitments may adversely affect our financial condition and cash flows from operations. We have a high level of debt, including the 0.25% convertible senior notes we issued in March 2013 (the  0.25% Senior Notes) due April 1, 2018, the loan we assumed when we purchased an office building located at 50 Fremont Street in San Francisco, California (50 Fremont) and capital lease arrangements. Additionally, we have significant contractual commitments in operating lease arrangements, which are not reflected on our consolidated balance sheets. In addition, we have a financing obligation for a leased facility of which we are deemed the owner for accounting purposes. In July 2016, we amended and restated our revolving credit facility under which we can draw down up to $1.0 billion. Also in July 2016, we entered into the $500.0 million term loan to finance our acquisition of Demandware. Maintenance of our indebtedness and contractual commitments and any additional issuances of indebtedness could: ##TABLE_START  impair our ability to obtain additional financing in the future for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, general corporate or other purposes; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  cause us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flows from operations towards debt service obligations and principal repayments; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  make us more vulnerable to downturns in our business, our industry or the economy in general; and ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  due to limitations within the revolving credit facility covenants, restrict our ability to incur additional indebtedness, grant liens, merge or consolidate, dispose of assets, make investments, make acquisitions, enter into transactions with affiliates, pay dividends or make distributions, repurchase stock and enter into restrictive agreements, as defined in the credit agreement. ##TABLE_END Our ability to meet our expenses and debt obligations will depend on our future performance, which will be affected by financial, business, economic, regulatory and other factors. We will not be able to control many of these factors, such as economic conditions and governmental regulations. Further, our operations may not generate sufficient cash to enable us to service our debt or contractual obligations resulting from our leases. If we fail to make a payment on our debt, we could be in default on such debt. If we are at any time unable to generate sufficient cash flows from operations to service our indebtedness when payment is due, we may be required to attempt to renegotiate the terms of the instruments relating to the indebtedness, seek to refinance all or a portion of the indebtedness or obtain additional financing. There can be no assurance that we would be able to successfully renegotiate such terms, that any such refinancing would be possible or that any additional financing could be obtained on terms that are favorable or acceptable to us. A failure to comply with the covenants and other provisions of our outstanding debt could result in events of default under such instruments, which could permit acceleration of all of our notes and borrowings under our revolving credit facility. Any required repayment of our notes or revolving credit facility as a result of a fundamental change or other acceleration would lower our current cash on hand such that we would not have those funds available for use in our business. New lease accounting guidance will require that we record operating lease activity on our consolidated balance sheet no later than fiscal 2020, which will result in an increase in both our assets and financing obligations. The implementation of this guidance may impact our ability to obtain the necessary financing from financial institutions at commercially viable rates or at all as this new guidance will result in a higher financing obligation on our consolidated balance sheet. Weakened global economic conditions may adversely affect our industry, business and results of operations. Our overall performance depends in part on worldwide economic and geopolitical conditions. The United States and other key international economies have experienced cyclical downturns from time to time in which economic activity was impacted by falling demand for a variety of goods and services, restricted credit, poor liquidity, reduced corporate profitability, volatility in credit, equity and foreign exchange markets, bankruptcies and overall uncertainty with respect to the economy. These economic conditions can arise suddenly and the full impact of such conditions can remain uncertain. In addition, recent geopolitical developments, including Brexit, have increased levels of political and economic unpredictability globally, and may increase the volatility of global financial markets; the impact of such developments on the global economy remains uncertain. Moreover, these conditions can affect the rate of information technology spending and could adversely affect our customers ability or willingness to purchase our enterprise cloud computing services, delay prospective customers purchasing decisions, reduce the value or duration of their subscription contracts, or affect attrition rates, all of which could adversely affect our operating results. Natural disasters and other events beyond our control could materially adversely affect us. Natural disasters or other catastrophic events may cause damage or disruption to our operations, international commerce and the global economy, and thus could have a strong negative effect on us. Our business operations are subject to interruption by natural disasters, fire, power shortages, pandemics and other events beyond our control. Although we maintain crisis management and disaster response plans, such events could make it difficult or impossible for us to deliver our services to our customers, and could decrease demand for our services. The majority of our research and development activities, corporate headquarters, information technology systems, and other critical business operations, are located near major seismic faults in the San Francisco Bay Area. Because we do not carry earthquake insurance for direct quake-related losses, with the exception of the building that we own in San Francisco, and significant recovery time could be required to resume operations, our financial condition and operating results could be materially adversely affected in the event of a major earthquake or catastrophic event. Current and future accounting pronouncements and other financial reporting standards, especially but not only concerning revenue recognition, cost capitalization and lease accounting, may negatively impact our financial results. We regularly monitor our compliance with applicable financial reporting standards and review new pronouncements and drafts thereof that are relevant to us. As a result of new standards, changes to existing standards and changes in their interpretation, we might be required to change our accounting policies, particularly concerning revenue recognition, the capitalized incremental costs to obtain a customer contract and lease accounting, to alter our operational policies so that they reflect new or amended financial reporting standards, or to restate our published financial statements. Such changes may have an adverse effect on our reputation, business, financial position, and profit, or cause an adverse deviation from our revenue and operating profit target, which may negatively impact our financial results. We may be subject to risks related to government contracts and related procurement regulations. Our contracts with federal, state, local, and foreign government entities are subject to various procurement regulations and other requirements relating to their formation, administration and performance. We may be subject to audits and investigations relating to our government contracts, and any violations could result in various civil and criminal penalties and administrative sanctions, including termination of contract, refunding or suspending of payments, forfeiture of profits, payment of fines, and suspension or debarment from future government business. In addition, such contracts may provide for termination by the government at any time, without cause. We are subject to governmental export and import controls that could impair our ability to compete in international markets and subject us to liability if we are not in full compliance with applicable laws. Our solutions are subject to export and import controls, including the Commerce Departments Export Administration Regulations, U.S. Customs regulations and various economic and trade sanctions regulations established by the Treasury Departments Office of Foreign Assets Control. If we fail to comply with these U.S. export control laws and import laws we and certain of our employees could be subject to substantial civil or criminal penalties, including the possible loss of export or import privileges; fines, which may be imposed on us and responsible employees or managers; and, in extreme cases, the incarceration of responsible employees or managers. Obtaining the necessary authorizations, including any required license, may be time-consuming, is not guaranteed and may result in the delay or loss of sales opportunities. Furthermore, the U.S. export control laws and economic sanctions laws prohibit the shipment of certain products and services to U.S. embargoed or sanctioned countries, governments and persons. Even though we take precautions to prevent our solutions from being provisioned or provided to U.S. sanctions targets, our solutions could be provisioned to those targets or provided by our resellers despite such precautions. Any such sales could have negative consequences, including government investigations, penalties and reputational harm. Changes in our solutions or changes in export and import regulations may create delays in the introduction, sale and deployment of our solutions in international markets or prevent the export or import of our solutions to certain countries, governments or persons altogether. Any decreased use of our solutions or limitation on our ability to export or sell our solutions would likely adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Risks Relating to Our Convertible Senior Notes and Our Common Stock The market price of our common stock is likely to be volatile and could subject us to litigation. The trading prices of the securities of technology companies have been highly volatile. Accordingly, the market price of our notes and common stock has been and is likely to continue to be subject to wide fluctuations. Factors affecting the market price of our notes and common stock include: ##TABLE_START  variations in our operating results, earnings per share, cash flows from operating activities, deferred revenue, year-over-year growth rates for individual core service offerings and other financial metrics and non-financial metrics, and how those results compare to analyst expectations; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  variations in, and limitations of, the various financial and other metrics and modeling used by analysts in their research and reports about our business; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  forward-looking guidance to industry and financial analysts related to future revenue and earnings per share; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  changes in the estimates of our operating results or changes in recommendations by securities analysts that elect to follow our common stock; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  announcements of technological innovations, new services or service enhancements, strategic alliances or significant agreements by us or by our competitors; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  announcements by us or by our competitors of mergers or other strategic acquisitions, or rumors of such transactions involving us or our competitors; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  announcements of customer additions and customer cancellations or delays in customer purchases; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  recruitment or departure of key personnel; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  disruptions in our service due to computer hardware, software, network or data center problems; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  the economy as a whole, market conditions in our industry and the industries of our customers; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  trading activity by a limited number of stockholders who together beneficially own a significant portion of our outstanding common stock; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  the issuance of shares of common stock by us, whether in connection with an acquisition, a capital raising transaction or upon conversion of some or all of our outstanding convertible senior notes; and ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  issuance of debt or other convertible securities. ##TABLE_END In addition, if the market for technology stocks or the stock market in general experiences uneven investor confidence, the market price of our notes and common stock could decline for reasons unrelated to our business, operating results or financial condition. The market price of our notes and common stock might also decline in reaction to events that affect other companies within, or outside, our industry even if these events do not directly affect us. Some companies that have experienced volatility in the trading price of their stock have been the subject of securities class action litigation. If we are the subject of such litigation, it could result in substantial costs and a diversion of managements attention and resources. We may issue additional shares of our common stock or instruments convertible into shares of our common stock, including in connection with the conversion of the notes, and thereby materially and adversely affect the market price of our common stock and the trading price of the notes. We are not restricted from issuing additional shares of our common stock or other instruments convertible into, or exchangeable or exercisable for, shares of our common stock during the life of the notes. If we issue additional shares of our common stock or instruments convertible into shares of our common stock, it may materially and adversely affect the market price of our common stock and, in turn, the trading price of the notes. In addition, the conversion of some or all of the notes may dilute the ownership interests of existing holders of our common stock, and any sales in the public market of any shares of our common stock issuable upon such conversion of the notes could adversely affect the prevailing market price of our common stock. In addition, the potential conversion of the notes could depress the market price of our common stock. We may not have the ability to pay the amount of cash due upon conversion of the notes or the fundamental change purchase price due when a holder submits its notes for purchase upon the occurrence of a fundamental change. Upon the occurrence of a fundamental change, holders of the notes may require us to purchase, for cash, all or a portion of their notes. In addition, if a holder converts its notes, we will generally pay such holder an amount of cash before delivering to such holder any shares of our common stock. There can be no assurance that we will have sufficient financial resources, or will be able to arrange financing, to pay the fundamental change purchase price if holders submit their notes for purchase by us upon the occurrence of a fundamental change or to pay the amount of cash due if holders surrender their notes for conversion. In addition, agreements governing any future debt may restrict our ability to make each of the required cash payments even if we have sufficient funds to make them. Furthermore, our ability to purchase the notes or to pay cash upon the conversion of the notes may be limited by law or regulatory authority. If we fail to purchase the notes, to pay interest due on the notes, or to pay the amount of cash due upon conversion, we will be in default under the indenture, which in turn may result in the acceleration of other indebtedness we may then have. If the repayment of the other indebtedness were to be accelerated, we may not have sufficient funds to repay that indebtedness and to purchase the notes or to pay the amount of cash due upon conversion. Our inability to pay for the notes that are tendered for purchase or upon conversion could result in note holders receiving substantially less than the principal amount of the notes, which could harm our reputation, financing opportunities and our business. The fundamental change provisions of the notes may delay or prevent an otherwise beneficial takeover attempt of us. The fundamental change purchase rights will allow holders of the notes to require us to purchase all or a portion of their notes upon the occurrence of a fundamental change. The provisions requiring an increase to the conversion rate for conversions in connection with a make-whole fundamental change may, in certain circumstances, delay or prevent a takeover of us and the removal of incumbent management that might otherwise be beneficial to investors.  The convertible note hedges and warrant transactions may affect the trading price of the notes and the market price of our common stock. We entered into privately negotiated convertible note hedge transactions with certain hedge counterparties concurrently with the pricing of the notes. We also entered into privately negotiated warrant transactions with the hedge counterparties. Taken together, the convertible note hedge transactions and the warrant transactions are expected, but not guaranteed, to reduce the potential dilution with respect to our common stock upon conversion of the notes. If, however, the price of our common stock, as measured under the terms of the warrant transactions, exceeds the exercise price of the warrant transactions, the warrant transactions will have a dilutive effect on our earnings per share to the extent that the price of our common stock as measured under the warrant transactions exceeds the strike price of the warrant transactions. The hedge counterparties and their respective affiliates periodically modify their hedge positions from time to time following the pricing of the notes (and are particularly likely to do so during any observation period relating to a conversion of the notes) by entering into or unwinding various over-the-counter derivative transactions with respect to our common stock, or by purchasing or selling shares of our common stock or the notes in privately negotiated transactions or open market transactions. The effect, if any, of these transactions and activities on the market price of our common stock or the trading price of the notes will depend in part on market conditions and cannot be ascertained at this time. Any of these activities, however, could adversely affect the market price of our common stock and the trading price of the notes. We do not make any representation or prediction as to the direction or magnitude of any potential effect that the transactions described above may have on the price of the notes or our common stock. In addition, we do not make any representation that the counterparties to those transactions will engage in these transactions or activities or that these transactions and activities, once commenced, will not be discontinued without notice; the counterparties or their affiliates may choose to engage in, or discontinue engaging in, any of these transactions or activities with or without notice at any time, and their decisions will be in their sole discretion and not within our control. We are subject to counterparty risk with respect to the convertible note hedge transactions. The hedge counterparties are financial institutions or affiliates of financial institutions, and we will be subject to the risk that these hedge counterparties may default under the convertible note hedge transactions. Our exposure to the credit risk of the hedge counterparties will not be secured by any collateral. If one or more of the hedge counterparties to one or more of our convertible note hedge transactions becomes subject to insolvency proceedings, we will become an unsecured creditor in those proceedings with a claim equal to our exposure at the time under those transactions. Our exposure will depend on many factors but, generally, the increase in our exposure will be correlated to the increase in our stock price and the volatility of our stock. In addition, upon a default by one of the hedge counterparties, we may suffer adverse tax consequences and dilution with respect to our common stock. We can provide no assurances as to the financial stability or viability of any of the hedge counterparties. Provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws and Delaware law might discourage, delay or prevent a change of control of our company or changes in our management and, therefore, depress the market price of our common stock. Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that could depress the market price of our common stock by acting to discourage, delay or prevent a change in control of our company or changes in our management that the stockholders of our company may deem advantageous. These provisions among other things: ##TABLE_START  permit the board of directors to establish the number of directors; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  provide that directors may only be removed with the approval of holders of 66 2/3 percent of our outstanding capital stock; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  require super-majority voting to amend some provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  authorize the issuance of blank check preferred stock that our board could use to implement a stockholder rights plan (also known as a poison pill); ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  prohibit the ability of our stockholders to call special meetings of stockholders; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  prohibit stockholder action by written consent, which requires all stockholder actions to be taken at a meeting of our stockholders; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  provide that the board of directors is expressly authorized to make, alter or repeal our bylaws; and ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  establish advance notice requirements for nominations for election to our board or for proposing matters that can be acted upon by stockholders at annual stockholder meetings. ##TABLE_END In addition, Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law may discourage, delay or prevent a change in control of our company. Section 203 imposes certain restrictions on merger, business combinations and other transactions between us and holders of 15 percent or more of our common stock. In addition, the fundamental change purchase rights applicable to the notes, which will allow note holders to require us to purchase all or a portion of their notes upon the occurrence of a fundamental change, and the provisions requiring an increase to the conversion rate for conversions in connection with a make-whole fundamental change, may in certain circumstances delay or prevent a takeover of us and the removal of incumbent management that might otherwise be beneficial to investors. ", "1B": " ITEM 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS None. ", "2": " ITEM 2. PROPERTIES As of January 31, 2017 , our executive and principal offices for sales, marketing, professional services and development consist of over 1.9 million square feet of leased and owned property in the San Francisco Bay Area. Of this total, we lease and occupy approximately 1.3 million square feet and own and occupy a majority of the approximately 820,000 square feet of total owned space at 50 Fremont Street. We also lease space in various locations throughout the United States for local sales and professional services personnel. Our foreign subsidiaries lease office space in a number of countries in Europe, North America, Asia, South America, Africa and Australia for our international operations, primarily for local sales and professional services personnel. In addition, in April 2014, we entered into a lease agreement for approximately 733,000 rentable square feet of under construction office space located in San Francisco, California. The lease payments associated with the lease will be approximately $590.0 million over the 15.5 year term of the lease, beginning in our second quarter of fiscal 2018. We do not currently occupy this property, and we have excluded this square footage from the total leased space in the San Francisco Bay Area stated above. We operate data centers in the U.S., Europe and Asia pursuant to various co-location lease arrangements. We believe that our existing facilities and offices are adequate to meet our current requirements. If we require additional space, we believe that we will be able to obtain such space on acceptable, commercially reasonable terms. ##TABLE_START ", "3": " ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS ##TABLE_END In the ordinary course of business, we are or may be involved in various legal proceedings and claims related to alleged infringement of third-party patents and other intellectual property rights, commercial, corporate and securities, labor and employment, class actions, wage and hour, and other claims. We have been, and may in the future be put on notice or sued by third parties for alleged infringement of their proprietary rights, including patent infringement. We evaluate all claims and lawsuits with respect to their potential merits, our potential defenses and counterclaims, settlement or litigation potential and the expected effect on us. Our technologies may be subject to injunction if they are found to infringe the rights of a third party. In addition, many of our subscription agreements require us to indemnify our customers for third-party intellectual property infringement claims, which could increase the cost to us of an adverse ruling on such a claim. The outcome of any claims or litigation, regardless of the merits, is inherently uncertain. Any claims and other lawsuits, and the disposition of such claims and lawsuits, whether through settlement or litigation, could be time-consuming and expensive to resolve, divert our attention from executing our business plan, result in efforts to enjoin our activities, lead to attempts by third parties to seek similar claims and, in the case of intellectual property claims, require us to change our technology, change our business practices, pay monetary damages or enter into short- or long-term royalty or licensing agreements. In general, the resolution of a legal matter could prevent us from offering our service to others, could be material to our financial condition or cash flows, or both, or could otherwise adversely affect our operating results. We make a provision for a liability relating to legal matters when it is both probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. These provisions are reviewed at least quarterly and adjusted to reflect the impacts of negotiations, estimated settlements, legal rulings, advice of legal counsel and other information and events pertaining to a particular matter. In our opinion, resolution of all current matters is not expected to have a material adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations, cash flows or financial position.

For consistency in presentation, working capital in the table above as of January 31, 2016, 2015, 2014, and 2013 includes amounts previously in Marketable securities, noncurrent. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (6) In April 2015, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2015-03, Interest - Imputation of Interest (Subtopic 835-30): Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs (ASU 2015-03), which simplifies the presentation of debt issuance costs by requiring debt issuance costs to be presented as a deduction from the corresponding debt liability rather than as an asset. However, ASU 2015-03 does not address deferred issuance costs for line-of-credit arrangements; therefore, in August 2015, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2015-15, Interest-Imputation of Interest: Presentation and Subsequent Measurement of Debt Issuance Costs Associated with Line-of-Credit Arrangements (ASU 2015-15). ASU 2015-15 allows an entity to defer debt issuance costs associated with line-of-credit arrangements, including arrangements with no outstanding borrowings, and classify them as an asset, and amortize them over the term of the arrangements. We adopted this standard retrospectively and reclassified all of our unamortized debt issuance costs previously reported in other assets, net to net against the respective debt liability balances. As a result of the reclassifications, total assets, working capital, long-term obligations excluding deferred revenue in the table above as of January 31, 2016, 2015, 2014 and 2013 were reclassified out of assets and netted against the long-term obligations. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (7) Long-term obligations primarily excludes deferred revenue, noncurrent and includes the term loan entered into in July 2016 for $500.0 million , loan assumed on 50 Fremont, the 0.75% convertible senior notes issued in January 2010, the 0.25% convertible senior notes issued in March 2013, the term loan entered into in July 2013 which was subsequently paid off in fiscal 2016, and the revolving credit facility entered into in October 2014 and amended July 2016. At January 31, 2015, the 0.75% notes had matured and were no longer outstanding. At January 31, 2014 and 2013, the 0.75% notes were convertible and accordingly were classified as a current liability. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START ", "7": " ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS ##TABLE_END The following discussion contains forward-looking statements, including, without limitation, our expectations and statements regarding our outlook and future revenues, expenses, results of operations, liquidity, plans, strategies and objectives of management and any assumptions underlying any of the foregoing. Our actual results may differ significantly from those projected in the forward-looking statements. Our forward-looking statements and factors that might cause future actual results to differ materially from our recent results or those projected in the forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, those discussed in the section titled Forward-Looking Information and Risk Factors of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Except as required by law, we assume no obligation to update the forward-looking statements or our risk factors for any reason. Overview We are a leading provider of enterprise cloud computing solutions, with a focus on customer relationship management, or CRM. We introduced our first CRM solution in February 2000, and we have since expanded our service offerings with new editions, features and platform capabilities. Our core mission is to help our customers transform by empowering them to connect with their customers in entirely new ways. Our Customer Success Platform - including sales force automation, customer service and support, marketing automation, digital commerce, community management, analytics, application development, Internet of Things (IoT) integration and collaborative productivity tools - provides the tools customers need to succeed in a digital world. Key elements of our strategy include: ##TABLE_START  extend existing service offerings; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  cross sell and upsell; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  expand into new horizontal markets; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  target vertical markets and industries; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  extend go-to-market capabilities; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  reduce customer attrition; and ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  encourage the development of third-party applications on our cloud computing platforms. ##TABLE_END In addition to the key elements of our business strategy described above, we evaluate opportunities to acquire or invest in complementary businesses, services and technologies and intellectual property rights. This evaluation resulted in a significant increase in our acquisition activity during fiscal 2017. We believe the factors that will influence our ability to achieve our objectives include: our prospective customers willingness to migrate to enterprise cloud computing services; the availability, performance and security of our service; our ability to continue to release, and gain customer acceptance of new and improved features; our ability to successfully integrate acquired businesses and technologies; successful customer adoption and utilization of our service; acceptance of our service in markets where we have few customers; the emergence of additional competitors in our market and improved product offerings by existing and new competitors; the location of new data centers that we operate as well as the new locations of services provided by third-party cloud computing platform providers; third-party developers willingness to develop applications on our platforms; our ability to attract new personnel and retain and motivate current personnel; and general economic conditions which could affect our customers ability and willingness to purchase our services, delay the customers purchasing decision or affect attrition rates. To address these factors, we will need to, among other things, continue to add substantial numbers of paying subscriptions, upgrade our customers to fully featured versions or arrangements such as an Enterprise License Agreement, provide high quality technical support to our customers, encourage the development of third-party applications on our platforms and continue to focus on retaining customers at the time of renewal. Our plans to invest for future growth include the continuation of the expansion of our data center capacity, the hiring of additional personnel, particularly in direct sales, other customer-related areas and research and development, the expansion of domestic and international selling and marketing activities, specifically in our top markets, continuing to develop our brands, the addition of distribution channels, the upgrade of our service offerings, the development of new services such as the introduction of our Analytics Cloud, Community Cloud, and IoT Cloud, the integration of new and acquired technologies such as Commerce Cloud, artificial intelligence technologies and Salesforce Quip, the expansion of our Marketing Cloud and Salesforce Platform (formerly App Cloud) core service offerings, and the additions to our global infrastructure to support our growth. We also regularly evaluate acquisitions or investment opportunities in complementary businesses, joint ventures, services and technologies and intellectual property rights in an effort to expand our service offerings. We expect to continue to make such investments and acquisitions in the future and we plan to reinvest a significant portion of our incremental revenue in future periods to grow our business and continue our leadership role in the cloud computing industry. As part of our growth strategy, we are delivering innovative solutions in new categories, including analytics, e-commerce, artificial intelligence and the Internet of Things. We drive innovation organically and to a lesser extent through acquisitions, such as our July 2016 acquisition of Demandware, Inc. (Demandware), a digital commerce leader. We have a disciplined and thoughtful acquisition process where we routinely survey the industry landscape across a wide range of companies. As a result of our aggressive growth plans and integration of our previously acquired businesses, we have incurred significant expenses from equity awards and amortization of purchased intangibles, which have reduced our operating income. We remained focused on improving operating margins in fiscal 2017 and expect to remain similarly focused in fiscal 2018. Our typical subscription contract term is 12 to 36 months, although terms range from one to 60 months, so during any fiscal reporting period only a subset of active subscription contracts is eligible for renewal. We calculate our attrition rate as of the end of each month. Our current attrition rate calculation does not include the Marketing and Commerce Cloud service offerings. Our attrition rate was between eight and nine percent during the fiscal year ended January 31, 2017 , which is comparable to the eight and nine percent attrition rate during the same period a year ago. While it is difficult to predict, we expect our attrition rate to remain in this range as we continue to expand our enterprise business and invest in customer success and related programs. We expect marketing and sales costs, which were 47 percent of our total revenues for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2017 and 49 percent for the same period a year ago, to continue to represent a substantial portion of total revenues in the future as we seek to grow our customer base, sell more products to existing customers, and build greater brand awareness. In July 2016 we acquired Demandware, an industry-leading provider of enterprise cloud commerce solutions in the digital commerce market. We acquired Demandware to expand our position in customer relationship management and to pursue the digital commerce market segment with the new Salesforce Commerce Cloud. The financial results of Demandware are included in our consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisition. The total purchase price for Demandware was approximately $2.9 billion . In July 2016, we entered into a credit agreement (the Term Loan Credit Agreement) which provides for a $500.0 million term loan (the Term Loan) that matures on July 11, 2019. All amounts borrowed under the Term Loan were used to pay a portion of the total purchase price for Demandware. Additionally, we entered into an Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (the Revolving Loan Credit Agreement) with Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, and certain other institutional lenders that increased our existing revolving credit facility dated October 2014 to $1.0 billion. As of January 31, 2017 , there was $200.0 million of borrowings outstanding under the revolving credit facility. In August 2016, we acquired the outstanding stock of Quip, Inc. (Quip). Quip combines content and communication to create living documents to allow work-teams to write, edit and discuss documents, spreadsheets and checklists in a single experience. The total purchase price for Quip was approximately $412.0 million . In November 2016, we acquired the outstanding stock of Krux Digital, Inc. (Krux). Krux is a leading data management platform that unifies, segments and activates audiences to increase engagement with users, prospects and customers. The total purchase price for Krux was approximately $741.8 million . Prior to these and other acquisitions during fiscal 2017, our most significant acquisition was ExactTarget, Inc in fiscal 2014. Fiscal Year Our fiscal year ends on January 31. References to fiscal 2017 , for example, refer to the fiscal year ending January 31, 2017 . Operating Segments We operate as one operating segment. Operating segments are defined as components of an enterprise for which separate financial information is evaluated regularly by the chief operating decision maker, who in our case is the chief executive officer, in deciding how to allocate resources and assess performance. Over the past few years, including fiscal 2017, we have completed a number of acquisitions. These acquisitions have allowed us to expand our offerings, presence and reach in various market segments of the enterprise cloud computing market. While we have offerings in multiple enterprise cloud computing market segments, including as a result of the Company's acquisitions, our business operates in one operating segment because the majority of our offerings operate on a single platform and are deployed in an identical way, and  our chief operating decision maker evaluates our financial information and resources and assesses the performance of these resources on a consolidated basis. Since we operate as one operating segment, all required financial segment information can be found in the consolidated financial statements. Sources of Revenues We derive our revenues from two sources: (1) subscription revenues, which are comprised of subscription fees from customers accessing our enterprise cloud computing services and from customers paying for additional support beyond the standard support that is included in the basic subscription fees; and (2) related professional services such as process mapping, project management, implementation services and other revenue. Other revenue consists primarily of training fees. Subscription and support revenues accounted for approximately 92 percent of our total revenues for fiscal 2017 . Subscription revenues are driven primarily by the number of paying subscribers, varying service types, the price of our service and renewals. We define a customer as a separate and distinct buying entity (e.g., a company, a distinct business unit of a large corporation, a partnership, etc.) that has entered into a contract to access our enterprise cloud computing services. We define a subscription as a unique user account purchased by a customer for use by its employees or other customer-authorized users, and we refer to each such user as a subscriber. The number of paying subscriptions at each of our customers ranges from one to hundreds of thousands. None of our customers accounted for more than five percent of our revenues during fiscal 2017 , 2016 or 2015 . Subscription and support revenues are recognized ratably over the contract terms beginning on the commencement dates of each contract. The typical subscription and support term is 12 to 36 months, although terms range from one to 60 months. Our subscription and support contracts are non-cancelable, though customers typically have the right to terminate their contracts for cause if we materially fail to perform. We generally invoice our customers in advance, in annual installments, and typical payment terms provide that our customers pay us within 30 days of invoice. Amounts that have been invoiced are recorded in accounts receivable and in deferred revenue, or in revenue depending on whether the revenue recognition criteria have been met. In general, we collect our billings in advance of the subscription service period. Professional services and other revenues consist of fees associated with consulting and implementation services and training. Our consulting and implementation engagements are billed on a time and materials, fixed fee or subscription basis. We also offer a number of training classes on implementing, using and administering our service that are billed on a per person, per class basis. Our typical professional services payment terms provide that our customers pay us within 30 days of invoice. In determining whether professional services can be accounted for separately from subscription and support revenues, we consider a number of factors, which are described in Critical Accounting Policies and EstimatesRevenue Recognition below. Revenue by Cloud Service Offering The information below is provided on a supplemental basis to give additional insight into the revenue performance of our individual core service offerings. All of the cloud offerings that we offer to customers are grouped into four major core cloud service offerings. Subscription and support revenues consisted of the following (in millions): ##TABLE_START   Fiscal Year Ended January 31,      Variance- Percent FY'17 and FY'16  Variance- Percent FY'16 and FY'15 Sales Cloud  $ 3,060.6  $ 2,699.0  $ 2,443.0  %  % Service Cloud  2,320.7  1,817.8  1,320.2  %  % Salesforce Platform and Other  1,441.6  1,034.7  745.3  %  % Marketing Cloud  933.3  654.1  505.3  %  % Total  $ 7,756.2  $ 6,205.6  $ 5,013.8     ##TABLE_ENDSubscription and support revenues from the Analytics Cloud, Community Cloud, IoT Cloud, Commerce Cloud and Salesforce Quip were not significant. Analytics Cloud, IoT Cloud and Salesforce Quip revenue is included with Salesforce Platform and Other in the table above. Community Cloud revenue is included in either Sales Cloud, Service Cloud or Salesforce Platform and Other revenue depending on the primary service offering purchased. Commerce Cloud revenue, resulting from our Demandware acquisition in July 2016, is included in Marketing Cloud. As required under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (U.S. GAAP), we recorded deferred revenue related to acquired contracts from Demandware at fair value. As a result, we did not recognize certain revenues related to these acquired contracts that Demandware would have otherwise recorded as an independent entity. Of the $933.3 million subscription and support revenue for Marketing Cloud for the fiscal year 2017, approximately 11 percent was attributed to our Demandware acquisition. To the extent Demandware contracts are renewed following the acquisition, we will recognize the revenues for the full values of the contracts over the respective contractual periods. In situations where a customer purchases multiple cloud offerings, such as through an Enterprise License Agreement, we allocate the contract value to each core service offering based on the customers estimated product demand plan and the service that was provided at the inception of the contract. We do not update these allocations based on actual product usage during the term of the contract. We have allocated approximately 13 percent of our total subscription and support revenues for fiscal 2017 and 10 percent for fiscal 2016 , based on customers estimated product demand plans and these allocated amounts are included in the table above. Additionally, some of our service offerings have similar features and functions. For example, customers may use the Sales Cloud, the Service Cloud or our Salesforce Platform to record account and contact information, which are similar features across these core service offerings. Depending on a customers actual and projected business requirements, more than one core service offering may satisfy the customers current and future needs. We record revenue based on the individual products ordered by a customer, and not according to the customers business requirements and usage. In addition, as we introduce new features and functions within each offering and refine our allocation methodology for changes in our business, we do not expect it to be practical to adjust historical revenue results by core service offering for comparability. Accordingly, comparisons of revenue performance by service offering over time may not be meaningful. Our Sales Cloud service offering is our most widely distributed service offering and has historically been the largest contributor of subscription and support revenues. As a result, Sales Cloud has the most international exposure and foreign exchange rate exposure, relative to the other cloud service offerings. Conversely, revenue for Marketing Cloud is primarily derived from the Americas, with little impact from foreign exchange rate movement. The revenue growth rates of each of our core service offerings fluctuate from quarter to quarter and over time. While we are a market leader in each core offering, we manage the total balanced product portfolio to deliver solutions to our customers. Accordingly, the revenue result for each cloud service offering is not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for any subsequent quarter. Seasonal Nature of Deferred Revenue, Accounts Receivable and Operating Cash Flow Deferred revenue primarily consists of billings to customers for our subscription service. Over 90 percent of the value of our billings to customers is for our subscription and support service. We generally invoice our customers in annual cycles. Approximately 80 percent of all subscription and support invoices were issued with annual terms during fiscal 2017 , which is consistent with fiscal 2016 . Occasionally, we bill customers for their multi-year contract on a single invoice which results in an increase in noncurrent deferred revenue. We typically issue renewal invoices in advance of the renewal service period, and depending on timing, the initial invoice for the subscription and services contract and the subsequent renewal invoice may occur in different quarters. This may result in an increase in deferred revenue and accounts receivable. There is a disproportionate weighting towards annual billings in the fourth quarter, primarily as a result of large enterprise account buying patterns. Our fourth quarter has historically been our strongest quarter for new business and renewals. The year on year compounding effect of this seasonality in both billing patterns and overall new and renewal business causes the value of invoices that we generate in the fourth quarter for both new business and renewals to increase as a proportion of our total annual billings. Accordingly, because of this billing activity, our first quarter is our largest collections and operating cash flow quarter. The sequential quarterly changes in accounts receivable, related deferred revenue and operating cash flow during the first three quarters of our fiscal year are not necessarily indicative of the billing activity that occurs in the fourth quarter as displayed below (in thousands, except unbilled deferred revenue): ##TABLE_START  January 31, 2017  October 31, 2016  July 31, 2016  April 30, 2016 Fiscal 2017        Accounts receivable, net $ 3,196,643  $ 1,281,425  $ 1,323,114  $ 1,192,965 Deferred revenue, current and noncurrent 5,542,802  3,495,133  3,823,561  4,006,914 Operating cash flow (1) 706,146  154,312  250,678  1,051,062 Unbilled deferred revenue (2) 9.0 bn  8.6 bn  8.0 bn  7.6 bn ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  January 31, 2016  October 31, 2015  July 31, 2015  April 30, 2015 Fiscal 2016        Accounts receivable, net $ 2,496,165  $ 1,060,726  $ 1,067,799  $ 926,381 Deferred revenue, current and noncurrent 4,291,553  2,846,510  3,034,991  3,056,820 Operating cash flow (1) 470,208  162,514  304,278  735,081 Unbilled deferred revenue (2) 7.1 bn  6.7 bn  6.2 bn  6.0 bn ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  January 31, 2015  October 31, 2014  July 31, 2014  April 30, 2014 Fiscal 2015        Accounts receivable, net $ 1,905,506  $ 794,590  $ 834,323  $ 684,155 Deferred revenue, current and noncurrent 3,321,449  2,223,977  2,352,904  2,324,615 Operating cash flow (1) 336,506  123,732  239,078  482,128 Unbilled deferred revenue (2) 5.7 bn  5.4 bn  5.0 bn  4.8 bn ##TABLE_END(1) Operating cash flow represents net cash provided by operating activities for the three months ended in the periods stated above. In the first quarter of fiscal year 2017, we adopted Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-09, Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Shared-Based Payment Accounting (ASU 2016-09), which addresses among other items, updates to the presentation and treatment of excess tax benefits related to stock based compensation on the Statements of Cash Flows. We have adopted changes to the statement of cash flows on a retrospective basis and have accordingly updated the operating cash flow amounts presented above. (2) Unbilled deferred revenue represents future billings under our non-cancelable subscription agreements that have not been invoiced and, accordingly, are not recorded in deferred revenue. Unbilled Deferred Revenue, an Operational Measure The U.S. GAAP deferred revenue balance on our consolidated balance sheet does not represent the total contract value of annual or multi-year, non-cancelable subscription agreements. Unbilled deferred revenue is an operational measure that represents future billings under our subscription agreements that have not been invoiced and, accordingly, are not recorded in deferred revenue. Unbilled deferred revenue amounts by quarter are reflected in the table above. Our typical contract length is between 12 and 36 months. We expect that the amount of unbilled deferred revenue will change from quarter to quarter for several reasons, including the specific timing, duration and size of large customer subscription agreements, varying billing cycles of subscription agreements, the specific timing of customer renewals, foreign currency fluctuations, the timing of when unbilled deferred revenue is to be recognized as revenue, and changes in customer financial circumstances. For multi-year subscription agreements billed annually, the associated unbilled deferred revenue is typically high at the beginning of the contract period, zero just prior to renewal, and increases if the agreement is renewed. Low unbilled deferred revenue attributable to a particular subscription agreement is often associated with an impending renewal and may not be an indicator of the likelihood of renewal or future revenue from such customer. Accordingly, we expect that the amount of aggregate unbilled deferred revenue will change from year-to-year depending in part upon the number and dollar amount of subscription agreements at particular stages in their renewal cycle. Such fluctuations are not a reliable indicator of future revenues. Unbilled deferred revenue does not include minimum revenue commitments from indirect sales channels, as we recognize revenue, deferred revenue, and any unbilled deferred revenue upon sell-through to an end user customer. Unbilled deferred revenue also does not include any estimates for overage billings above a customer's minimum commitment. Cost of Revenues and Operating Expenses Cost of Revenues. Cost of subscription and support revenues primarily consists of expenses related to delivering our service and providing support, the costs of data center capacity, depreciation or operating lease expense associated with computer equipment and software, allocated overhead, amortization expense associated with capitalized software related to our services and acquired developed technologies and certain fees paid to various third parties for the use of their technology, services and data. We allocate overhead such as information technology infrastructure, rent and occupancy charges based on headcount. Employee benefit costs and taxes are allocated based upon a percentage of total compensation expense. As such, general overhead expenses are reflected in each cost of revenue and operating expense category. Cost of professional services and other revenues consists primarily of employee-related costs associated with these services, including stock-based expenses, the cost of subcontractors, certain third party fees and allocated overhead. The cost of providing professional services is significantly higher as a percentage of the related revenue than for our enterprise cloud computing subscription service due to the direct labor costs and costs of subcontractors. We intend to continue to invest additional resources in our enterprise cloud computing services. For example, we have invested in additional database software and we plan to increase the capacity that we are able to offer globally through data centers and third party infrastructure providers. As we acquire new businesses and technologies, the amortization expense associated with this activity will be included in cost of revenues. Additionally, as we enter into new contracts with third parties for the use of their technology, services or data, or as our sales volume grows, the fees paid to use such technology or services may increase. The timing of these additional expenses will affect our cost of revenues, both in terms of absolute dollars and as a percentage of revenues, in the affected periods. Research and Development . Research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries and related expenses, including stock-based expenses, the costs of our development and test data center and allocated overhead. We continue to focus our research and development efforts on adding new features and services, integrating acquired technologies, increasing the functionality and security and enhancing the ease of use of our enterprise cloud computing services. Our proprietary, scalable and secure multi-tenant architecture enables us to provide all of our customers with a service based on a single version of our application. As a result, we do not have to maintain multiple versions, which enables us to have relatively lower research and development expenses as compared to traditional enterprise software companies. We expect that in the future, research and development expenses will increase in absolute dollars and may increase as a percentage of total revenues as we invest in building the necessary employee and system infrastructure required to support the development of new, and improve existing, technologies and the integration of acquired businesses and technologies. Marketing and Sales. Marketing and sales expenses are our largest cost and consist primarily of salaries and related expenses, including stock-based expenses, for our sales and marketing staff, including commissions, payments to partners, marketing programs and allocated overhead. Marketing programs consist of advertising, events, corporate communications, brand building and product marketing activities. We plan to continue to invest in marketing and sales by expanding our domestic and international selling and marketing activities, building brand awareness, attracting new customers and sponsoring additional marketing events. The timing of these marketing events, such as our annual and largest event, Dreamforce, will affect our marketing costs in a particular quarter. We expect that in the future, marketing and sales expenses will increase in absolute dollars and continue to be our largest cost. General and Administrative. General and administrative expenses consist of salaries and related expenses, including stock-based expenses, for finance and accounting, legal, internal audit, human resources and management information systems personnel, legal costs, professional fees, other corporate expenses and allocated overhead. We expect that in the future, general and administrative expenses will increase in absolute dollars as we invest in our infrastructure and we incur additional employee related costs, professional fees and insurance costs related to the growth of our business and international expansion. We expect general and administrative costs as a percentage of total revenues to either remain flat or decrease for the next several quarters. However, the timing of additional expenses in a particular quarter, both in terms of absolute dollars and as a percentage of revenues, will affect our general and administrative expenses. Stock-Based Expenses. Our cost of revenues and operating expenses include stock-based expenses related to equity plans for employees and non-employee directors. We recognize our stock-based compensation as an expense in the statement of operations based on their fair values and vesting periods. These charges have been significant in the past and we expect that they will increase as our stock price increases, as we acquire more companies, as we hire more employees and seek to retain existing employees. During fiscal 2017 , we recognized stock-based expense of $820.4 million . As of January 31, 2017 , the aggregate stock compensation remaining to be amortized to costs and expenses was $2.6 billion . We expect this stock compensation balance to be amortized as follows: $980.5 million during fiscal 2018 ; $762.9 million during fiscal 2019 ; $540.5 million during fiscal 2020 ; $249.7 million during fiscal 2021 ; $17.4 million during fiscal 2022 ; $17.2 million during fiscal 2023 ; $8.0 million during fiscal 2024 . The expected amortization reflects only outstanding stock awards as of January 31, 2017 and assumes no forfeiture activity. We expect to continue to issue stock-based awards to our employees in future periods. Amortization of Purchased Intangibles from Business Combinations . Our cost of revenues and operating expenses include amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets, such as the amortization of the cost associated with an acquired companys research and development efforts, trade names, customer lists and customer relationships. We expect this expense to fluctuate as we acquire more companies. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, costs and expenses, and related disclosures. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates and assumptions. Our actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. We believe that of our significant accounting policies, which are described in Note 1 Summary of Business and Significant Accounting Policies to our consolidated financial statements, the following accounting policies involve a greater degree of judgment and complexity. Accordingly, these are the policies we believe are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our consolidated financial condition and results of operations. Revenue Recognition . We derive our revenues from two sources: (1) subscription revenues, which are comprised of subscription fees from customers accessing our enterprise cloud computing services and from customers purchasing additional support beyond the standard support that is included in the basic subscription fee; and (2) related professional services such as process mapping, project management, implementation services and other revenue. Other revenue consists primarily of training fees. We commence revenue recognition when all of the following conditions are satisfied: ##TABLE_START  there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  the service has been or is being provided to the customer; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  the collection of the fees is reasonably assured; and ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  the amount of fees to be paid by the customer is fixed or determinable. ##TABLE_END Our subscription service arrangements are non-cancelable and do not contain refund-type provisions. Subscription and Support Revenues Subscription and support revenues are recognized ratably over the contract terms beginning on the commencement date of each contract, which is the date our service is made available to customers. Amounts that have been invoiced are recorded in accounts receivable and in deferred revenue or revenue, depending on whether the revenue recognition criteria have been met. Professional Services and Other Revenues Our professional services contracts are either on a time and materials, fixed-fee or subscription basis. As discussed below, these revenues are recognized as the services are rendered for time and materials contracts, and when the milestones are achieved and accepted by the customer or on a proportional performance basis for fixed price contracts and ratably over the contract term for subscription professional services. The milestone method for revenue recognition is used when there is substantive uncertainty at the date the contract is entered into whether the milestone will be achieved. Training revenues are recognized after the services are performed. Multiple Deliverable Arrangements We enter into arrangements with multiple deliverables that generally include multiple subscriptions, premium support, and professional services. If the deliverables have standalone value at contract inception, we account for each deliverable separately. Subscription services have standalone value as such services are often sold separately. In determining whether professional services have standalone value, we consider the following factors for each professional services agreement: availability of the services from other vendors, the nature of the professional services, the timing of when the professional services contract was signed in comparison to the subscription service start date, and the contractual dependence of the subscription service on the customers satisfaction with the professional services work. To date, we have concluded that all of the professional services included in multiple deliverable arrangements executed have standalone value. Multiple deliverables included in an arrangement are separated into different units of accounting and the arrangement consideration is allocated to the identified separate units based on a relative selling price hierarchy. We determine the relative selling price for a deliverable based on its vendor-specific objective evidence of selling price (VSOE), if available, or our best estimate of selling price (BESP), if VSOE is not available. We have determined that third-party evidence (TPE) is not a practical alternative due to differences in our service offerings compared to other parties and the availability of relevant third-party pricing information. The amount of revenue allocated to delivered items is limited by contingent revenue, if any. For certain professional services, we have established VSOE as a consistent number of standalone sales of this deliverable have been priced within a reasonably narrow range. We have not established VSOE for our subscription services due to lack of pricing consistency, the introduction of new services and other factors. Accordingly, we use our BESP to determine the relative selling price. We determined BESP by considering our overall pricing objectives and market conditions. Significant pricing practices taken into consideration include our discounting practices, the size and volume of our transactions, the customer demographic, the geographic area where our services are sold, our price lists, our go-to-market strategy, historical standalone sales and contract prices. The determination of BESP is made through consultation with and approval by management, taking into consideration the go-to-market strategy. As our go-to-market strategies evolve, we may modify our pricing practices in the future, which could result in changes in relative selling prices, including both VSOE and BESP. Deferred Revenue. The deferred revenue balance does not represent the total contract value of annual or multi-year, non-cancelable subscription agreements. Deferred revenue primarily consists of billings or payments received in advance of revenue recognition from subscription services described above and is recognized as the revenue recognition criteria are met. We generally invoice customers in annual installments. The deferred revenue balance is influenced by several factors, including seasonality, the compounding effects of renewals, invoice duration, invoice timing, dollar size and new business linearity within the quarter. Deferred revenue that will be recognized during the succeeding twelve month period is recorded as current deferred revenue and the remaining portion is recorded as noncurrent. Deferred Commissions. We defer commission payments to our direct sales force. The commissions are deferred and amortized to sales expense over the non-cancelable terms of the related subscription contracts with our customers, which are typically 12 to 36 months. The commission payments, which are paid in full the month after the customers service commences, are a direct and incremental cost of the revenue arrangements. The deferred commission amounts are recoverable through the future revenue streams under the non-cancelable customer contracts. We believe this is the preferable method of accounting as the commission charges are so closely related to the revenue from the non-cancelable customer contracts that they should be recorded as an asset and charged to expense over the same period that the subscription revenue is recognized. During fiscal 2017 , we deferred $462.0 million of commission expenditures and we amortized $371.5 million to sales expense. During fiscal 2016 , we deferred $380.0 million of commission expenditures and we amortized $319.1 million to sales expense. Deferred commissions on our consolidated balance sheets totaled $539.6 million at January 31, 2017 and $449.1 million at January 31, 2016 . Capitalized Internal-Use Software Costs . We are required to follow the guidance of Accounting Standards Codification 350 (ASC 350), Intangibles- Goodwill and Other in accounting for the cost of computer software developed for internal-use and the accounting for web-based product development costs. ASC 350 requires companies to capitalize qualifying computer software costs, which are incurred during the application development stage, and amortize these costs on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the respective asset. We deliver our enterprise cloud computing solutions as a service via all the major Internet browsers and on leading major mobile device operating systems. As a result of this software as a service delivery model, we believe we have larger capitalized costs as compared to traditional enterprise software companies as they are required to use a different accounting standard. Costs related to preliminary project activities and post implementation activities are expensed as incurred. Internal-use software is amortized on a straight-line basis over its estimated useful life. We evaluate the useful lives of these assets on an annual basis and test for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances occur that could impact the recoverability of these assets. Stock-Based Expense. We recognize stock-based expenses related to stock options and restricted stock awards on a straight-line basis, net of estimated forfeitures, over the requisite service period of the awards, which is generally the vesting term of four years . We recognize stock-based expenses related to shares issued pursuant to our 2004 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (ESPP) on a straight-line basis over the offering period, which is 12 months . Stock-based expenses related to performance share grants are measured based on grant date fair value and expensed on a straight-line basis over the service period of the awards, which is generally the vesting term of three years. We, at times, grant unvested restricted shares to employee stockholders of certain acquired companies in lieu of cash consideration. These awards are generally subject to continued post-acquisition employment, and as a result, we have accounted for them as post-acquisition stock-based expense. We recognize stock-based expenses equal to the grant date fair value of the restricted stock awards on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period of the awards. Business Combinations. Accounting for business combinations requires us to make significant estimates and assumptions, especially at the acquisition date with respect to tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed and pre-acquisition contingencies. We use our best estimates and assumptions to accurately assign fair value to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date. Examples of critical estimates in valuing certain of the intangible assets and goodwill we have acquired include but are not limited to: ##TABLE_START  future expected cash flows from subscription and support contracts, professional services contracts, other customer contracts and acquired developed technologies and patents; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  the acquired companys trade name, trademark and existing customer relationship, as well as assumptions about the period of time the acquired trade name and trademark will continue to be used in our offerings; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  uncertain tax positions and tax related valuation allowances assumed; and ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  discount rates. ##TABLE_END Unanticipated events and circumstances may occur that may affect the accuracy or validity of such assumptions, estimates or actual results. In the event that we acquire an entity in which we previously held a strategic investment, the difference between the fair value of the shares as of the date of the acquisition and the carrying value of the strategic investment is recorded as a gain or loss and disclosed separately within the statements of operations. Goodwill and Intangibles. We make estimates, assumptions, and judgments when valuing goodwill and other intangible assets in connection with the initial purchase price allocation of an acquired entity, as well as when evaluating the recoverability of our goodwill and other intangible assets on an ongoing basis. These estimates are based upon a number of factors, including historical experience, market conditions, and information obtained from the management of acquired companies. Critical estimates in valuing certain intangible assets include, but are not limited to, historical and projected attrition rates, discount rates, anticipated growth in revenue from the acquired customers and acquired technology, and the expected use of the acquired assets. These factors are also considered in determining the useful life of acquired intangible assets. The amounts and useful lives assigned to identified intangible assets impact the amount and timing of future amortization expense. Income Taxes. We use the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on temporary differences between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in the consolidated statements of operations in the period that includes the enactment date. Our tax positions are subject to income tax audits by multiple tax jurisdictions throughout the world. We recognize the tax benefit of an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the position is sustainable upon examination by the taxing authority, based on the technical merits. The tax benefit recognized is measured as the largest amount of benefit which is greater than 50 percent likely to be realized upon settlement with the taxing authority. We recognize interest accrued and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in our income tax provision. Valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amounts that are more likely than not expected to be realized based on the weighting of positive and negative evidence. Future realization of deferred tax assets ultimately depends on the existence of sufficient taxable income of the appropriate character (for example, ordinary income or capital gain) within the carryback or carryforward periods available under the applicable tax law. We regularly review the deferred tax assets for recoverability based on historical taxable income, projected future taxable income, the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences and tax planning strategies. Our judgment regarding future profitability may change due to many factors, including future market conditions and the ability to successfully execute the business plans and/or tax planning strategies. Should there be a change in the ability to recover deferred tax assets, our income tax provision would increase or decrease in the period in which the assessment is changed. Strategic Investments. We hold strategic investments in marketable equity securities and non-marketable debt and equity securities in which we do not have a controlling interest or significant influence, as defined in Accounting Standards Codification 323 (ASC 323), Investments - Equity Method and Joint Ventures. Marketable equity securities are measured using quoted prices in their respective active markets and non-marketable debt and equity securities are recorded at cost. If, based on the terms of our ownership of these marketable and non-marketable securities, we determine that we exercise significant influence on the entity to which these marketable and non-marketable securities relate, we apply the equity method of accounting for such investments. We determine the fair value of our marketable equity securities and non-marketable debt and equity securities quarterly for impairment and disclosure purposes; however, the non-marketable debt and equity securities are recorded at fair value only if an impairment is recognized. The measurement of fair value requires significant judgment and includes a qualitative and quantitative analysis of events and circumstances that impact the fair value of the investment. Our assessment of the severity and duration of the impairment and qualitative and quantitative analysis includes the investees financial metrics, the investees products and technologies meeting or exceeding predefined milestones, market acceptance of the product or technology, other competitive products or technology in the market, general market conditions, management and governance structure of the investee, investees liquidity, debt ratios and the rate at which the investee is using its cash, and investees receipt of additional funding at a lower valuation. In determining the estimated fair value of our strategic investments in privately held companies, we utilize the most recent data available to us. Valuations of privately held companies are inherently complex due to the lack of readily available market data. If the fair value of an investment is below our cost, we determine whether the investment is other-than-temporarily impaired based on our qualitative and quantitative analysis, which includes the severity and duration of the impairment. If the investment is considered to be other-than-temporarily impaired, we record the investment at fair value by recognizing an impairment through the income statement and establishing a new cost basis for the investment.

Unbilled deferred revenue represents future billings under our non-cancelable subscription agreements that have not been invoiced and, accordingly, are not recorded in deferred revenue. The January 31, 2017 balance includes approximately $450.0 million related to Demandware, which we acquired in July 2016.

Subscription and support revenues were $7.8 billion , or 92 percent of total revenues, for fiscal 2017 , compared to $6.2 billion , or 93 percent of total revenues, during the same period a year ago, an increase of $1.6 billion , or 25 percent . The increase in subscription and support revenues in fiscal 2017 was primarily caused by volume-driven increases from new business, which includes new customers, upgrades and additional subscriptions from existing customers. Revenue resulting from our July 2016 acquisition of Demandware contributed $120.4 million to total revenues for fiscal 2017 . Revenues from other acquired businesses in fiscal 2017 were not material. We continue to invest in a variety of customer programs and initiatives, which, along with increasing enterprise adoption, have helped keep our attrition rate consistent as compared to the prior year. Our attrition rate also played a role in the increase in subscription and support revenues. Changes in our pricing have not been a significant driver of revenue growth for the periods presented. Professional services and other revenues were $635.8 million , or eight percent of total revenues, for fiscal 2017 , compared to $461.6 million , or seven percent of total revenues, for the same period a year ago, an increase of $174.2 million , or 38 percent . The increase is primarily due to the growth in our subscription professional services. Revenues by geography were as follows (in thousands):  ##TABLE_START   Fiscal Year Ended January 31,     Americas  $ 6,224,971  $ 4,910,745  $ 3,868,329 Europe  1,373,547  1,162,808  984,919 Asia Pacific  793,466  593,663  520,338   $ 8,391,984  $ 6,667,216  $ 5,373,586 ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START   Fiscal Year Ended January 31,     Revenues by geography:       Americas  %  %  % Europe    Asia Pacific      %  %  % ##TABLE_ENDRevenues in Europe and Asia Pacific accounted for $2.2 billion , or 26 percent of total revenues, for fiscal 2017 , compared to $1.8 billion , or 26 percent of total revenues, during the same period a year ago, an increase of $410.5 million , or 23 percent . The increase in revenues on a total dollar basis outside of the Americas was the result of the increasing acceptance of our service, our focus on marketing our services internationally, additional resources and consistent attrition rates as a result of the reasons stated above. Revenues outside of the Americas increased on a total dollar basis in fiscal 2017 despite an overall strengthening of the U.S. dollar, which reduced aggregate international revenues by $103.8 million compared to fiscal 2016. Americas revenue attributed to the United States was approximately 96 percent , 95 percent and 94 percent for fiscal 2017 , 2016 and 2015 , respectively. No other country represented more than ten percent of total revenue during fiscal 2017 , 2016 or 2015 .

The increase in absolute dollars was primarily due to an increase of $240.9 million in employee-related costs, an increase of $38.0 million in stock-based expenses, an increase of $162.4 million in service delivery costs, primarily due to our efforts to increase data center capacity, an increase of $23.5 million in professional and outside services, an increase of amortization of purchased intangibles of $46.8 million , an increase in depreciation of equipment of $16.2 million and an increase in allocated overhead of $35.9 million . We have increased our headcount by 34 percent since January 31, 2016 to meet the higher demand for services from our customers and as a result of our fiscal 2017 acquisitions. We intend to continue to invest additional resources in our enterprise cloud computing services and data center capacity. Additionally, the amortization of purchased intangible assets may increase as we acquire additional businesses and technologies. We also plan to add additional employees in our professional services group to facilitate the adoption of our services. The timing of these expenses will affect our cost of revenues, both in terms of absolute dollars and as a percentage of revenues in future periods. The cost of professional services and other revenues exceeded the related revenue during fiscal 2017 and fiscal 2016 by $41.9 million and $4.0 million , respectively. The increase is primarily due to the growth in our headcount as well as the increase in employee costs for our subscription professional services employees. We expect the cost of professional services to continue to exceed revenue from professional services in future fiscal years. We believe that this investment in professional services facilitates the adoption of our service offerings.

The increase in absolute dollars was primarily due to an increase of $173.2 million in employee-related costs, an increase of $58.1 million in stock-based expense, an increase of $28.1 million in development and test data center expense, and an increase in allocated overhead. We increased our research and development headcount by 35 percent since January 31, 2016 in order to improve and extend our service offerings and develop new technologies as a result of our fiscal 2017 acquisitions. We expect that research and development expenses will increase in absolute dollars and may increase as a percentage of revenues in future periods as we continue to invest in additional employees and technology to support the development of new, and improve existing, technologies and the integration of acquired technologies. Marketing and sales expenses were $3.9 billion , or 47 percent of total revenues, for fiscal 2017 , compared to $3.2 billion , or 49 percent of total revenues, during the same period a year ago, an increase of $678.2 million . The increase in absolute dollars was primarily due to increases of $484.3 million in employee-related costs, including amortization of deferred commissions, $34.7 million in advertising expense, $20.4 million in amortization of purchased intangibles, $99.8 million stock-based expense and $36.5 million in allocated overhead. Our marketing and sales headcount increased by 24 percent since January 31, 2016 . The increase in headcount was also attributable to hiring additional sales personnel to focus on adding new customers and increasing penetration within our existing customer base. General and administrative expenses were $967.6 million , or 11 percent of total revenues, for fiscal 2017 , compared to $748.2 million , or 11 percent of total revenues, during the same period a year ago, an increase of $219.3 million . The increase was primarily due to an increase of $175.2 million in employee-related costs, an increase of $30.9 million in stock-based expense and an increase in professional and outside services. Our general and administrative headcount increased by 22 percent since January 31, 2016 as we added personnel to support our growth. In connection with the purchase of 50 Fremont, we recognized a net non-cash gain in fiscal 2016 totaling approximately $36.6 million on the termination of the lease signed in January 2012. Other income and expense. ##TABLE_START   Fiscal Year Ended January 31,  Variance Dollars (in thousands)    Investment income  $ 27,374  $ 15,341  $ 12,033 Interest expense  (88,988 )  (72,485 )  (16,503 ) Other income (expense)  9,072  (15,292 )  24,364 Gain on sales of land and building improvements   21,792  (21,792 ) Gains from acquisitions of strategic investments  13,697   13,697 ##TABLE_ENDInvestment income consists of income on our cash and marketable securities balances. Investment income was $27.4 million for fiscal 2017 and was $15.3 million during the same period a year ago. The increase was due to both realized gains resulting from the sales of marketable securities as well as higher interest income across our portfolio. Interest expense consists of interest on our convertible senior notes, capital leases, financing obligation related to 350 Mission, the loan assumed on 50 Fremont, revolving credit facility and the $500.0 million term loan that was entered into in connection with our acquisition of Demandware. Interest expense was $89.0 million for fiscal 2017 and was $72.5 million  during the same period a year ago. The increase was primarily due to the term loan in fiscal 2017 associated with the Demandware purchase and our outstanding balance in our revolving facility in in fiscal 2017. Other income (expense) primarily consists of non-operating transactions such as strategic investments fair market value adjustments, gains and losses from foreign exchange rate fluctuations and real estate transactions. Gain on sales of land and building improvements consists of the gain the company recognized from sales of undeveloped real estate and a portion of associated perpetual parking rights in San Francisco, California. Gain on sales of land and building improvements, net of closing costs, was $21.8 million during fiscal 2016. Gains from acquisitions of strategic investments represents gains on sales of strategic investments when we acquire an entity in which we previously held a strategic investment. The difference between the fair value of the shares as of the date of the acquisition and the carrying value of the strategic investment is recorded as a gain or loss and disclosed separately within the statements of operations. Benefit from (provision for) income taxes. ##TABLE_START   Fiscal Year Ended January 31,  Variance Dollars (in thousands)    Benefit from (provision for) income taxes  $ 154,249  $ (111,705 )  $ 265,954 Effective tax rate  (608 )%  %   ##TABLE_ENDWe reported a tax benefit of $154.2 million on a pretax income of $25.4 million , which resulted in a negative effective tax rate of 608 percent for fiscal 2017 . The most significant component of this tax amount was the tax benefit of $210.3 million from a partial release of the valuation allowance in connection with the acquisition of Demandware. The net deferred tax liability from the acquisition of Demandware provided a source of additional income to support the realizability of our preexisting deferred tax assets and as a result, we released a portion of our tax valuation allowance. The tax benefit associated with the release of the valuation allowance was partially offset by income taxes in profitable jurisdictions outside the United States. Additionally, as a result of early adopting Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-09, Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Shared-Based Payment Accounting (ASU 2016-09) and our valuation allowance position, we did not record significant U.S. current income tax expense. We recorded a tax provision of $111.7 million with a pretax income of $64.3 million , which resulted in an effective tax rate of 174 percent for fiscal 2016 . We had a tax provision in profitable jurisdictions outside the United States and current tax expense in the United States. We had U.S. current tax expense as a result of taxable income before considering certain excess tax benefits from stock options and vesting of restricted stock. We regularly assess the realizability of our deferred tax assets and establish a valuation allowance if it is more-likely-than-not that some or all of our deferred tax assets will not be realized. We evaluate and weigh all available positive and negative evidence such as historic results, future reversals of existing deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income, as well as prudent and feasible tax-planning strategies. Generally, more weight is given to objectively verifiable evidence, such as the cumulative loss in recent years. We will adjust our valuation allowance in the event sufficient positive evidence overcomes the negative evidence of losses in recent years, for example, if the trend in increasing taxable income continues. Our valuation allowance could contribute to the volatility of our effective tax rate and is difficult to forecast in future periods.

The increase in subscription and support revenues in fiscal 2016 was primarily attributable to volume-driven increases from new business, which includes new customers, upgrades and additional subscriptions from existing customers. Our attrition rate, which was favorable compared to the prior year, also played a role in the increase in subscription and support revenues. Changes in the net price per user per month were not a significant driver of revenue growth for the periods presented. Professional services and other revenues were $461.6 million, or seven percent of total revenues, for fiscal 2016, compared to $359.8 million, or seven percent of total revenues, for the same period a year ago, an increase of $101.8 million, or 28 percent.

The increase in revenues on a total dollar basis outside of the Americas was the result of the increasing acceptance of our service, our focus on marketing our services internationally, additional resources and consistent attrition rates as a result of the reasons stated above. Revenues outside of the Americas increased on a total dollar basis in fiscal 2016 despite an overall strengthening of the U.S. dollar, which reduced aggregate international revenues by $170.5 million compared to fiscal 2015.

Cash provided by operating activities has historically been affected by the amount of net income adjusted for non-cash expense items such as depreciation and amortization; amortization of purchased intangibles from business combinations; amortization of debt discount; discrete items such as the non-cash gain from the termination of the 50 Fremont lease; the expense associated with stock-based awards; gains on sales of strategic investments; the timing of employee related costs including commissions and bonus payments; the timing of payments against accounts payable, accrued expenses and other current liabilities; the timing of collections from our customers, which is our largest source of operating cash flows; the timing of business combination activity and the related integration and transaction costs; and changes in working capital accounts. Net cash provided by operating activities was also impacted by payments made during fiscal 2017 for the transaction fees related to the acquisitions we completed during the year. Our working capital accounts consist of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, accounts receivable, deferred commissions, prepaid assets and other current assets. Claims against working capital include accounts payable, accrued expenses, deferred revenue, and other current liabilities and payments related to our debt obligations. Our working capital may be impacted by factors in future periods such as billings to customers for subscriptions and support services and the subsequent collection of those billings, certain amounts and timing of which are seasonal. Our working capital in some quarters, may be impacted by adverse foreign currency exchange rate movements. Our billings are also influenced by new business linearity within the quarters and across quarters. As described above in Seasonal Nature of Deferred Revenue, Accounts Receivable and Operating Cash Flow, our fourth quarter has historically been our strongest quarter for new business and renewals. The year on year compounding effect of this seasonality in both billing patterns and overall business causes the value of invoices that we generate in the fourth quarter to increase as a proportion of our total annual billings. We generally invoice our customers for our subscription and services contracts in advance in annual installments. We typically issue renewal invoices in advance of the renewal service period, and depending on timing, the initial invoice for the subscription and services contract and the subsequent renewal invoice may occur in different quarters. Such invoice amounts are initially reflected in accounts receivable and deferred revenue, which is reflected on the balance sheet. The operating cash flow benefit of increased billing activity generally occurs in the subsequent quarter when we collect from our customers. As such, our first quarter is our largest collections and operating cash flow quarter. Net cash used in investing activities was $2.7 billion during fiscal 2017 and $1.5 billion during the same period a year ago. The net cash used in investing activities during fiscal 2017 primarily related to business combinations with the largest being the acquisition of Demandware in July 2016, purchases of marketable securities of approximately $1.1 billion , new office build-outs and strategic and capital investments, which were offset by the cash inflows for the period from sales and maturities of marketable securities of $2.0 billion . Net cash used in investing activities was $1.5 billion during fiscal 2016 and $698.4 million during fiscal 2015. The net cash used in investing activities during fiscal 2016 primarily related to capital expenditures, strategic investments, business combinations, purchase of 50 Fremont land and building, new office build-outs, investment of cash balances offset by proceeds from sales and maturities of marketable securities and proceeds from sales of Mission Bay land and the use of restricted cash to purchase 50 Fremont land and building. Net cash provided by financing activities was $997.7 million during fiscal 2017 as compared to net cash provided by financing activities of $73.2 million during the same period a year ago. Net cash provided by financing activities during fiscal 2017 consisted primarily of $748.8 million proceeds from borrowings under our revolving credit facility, $495.6 million of proceeds from the Term Loan, net of loan fees, $401.5 million from proceeds from equity plans and the reclassification of excess tax benefits from employee stock plans to cash flows from operating activities due to the early adoption of ASU 2016-09 offset by $98.2 million of principal payments on capital leases and $550.0 million payment of our revolving credit facility. Net cash provided by financing activities was $73.2 million during fiscal 2016 as compared to net cash used in financing activities of $318.2 million during fiscal 2015. Net cash provided by financing activities during fiscal 2016 consisted primarily of $455.5 million from proceeds from equity plan offset by $82.3 million of principal payments on capital leases and $300.0 million payment of our revolving credit facility. During fiscal 2015, we repaid the convertible senior notes that matured. In March 2013, we issued at par value $1.15 billion of 0.25% convertible senior notes (the 0.25% Senior Notes), due April 1, 2018, unless earlier purchased by us or converted. The 0.25% Senior Notes will be convertible if during any 20 trading days during the 30 consecutive trading days of any fiscal quarter, our common stock trades at a price exceeding 130% of the conversion price of $66.44 per share applicable to the 0.25% Senior Notes. The 0.25% Senior Notes are classified as a noncurrent liability on our consolidated balance sheet as of January 31, 2017 . Our common stock did not trade at a price exceeding 130% of the conversion price of $66.44 per share applicable to the Notes during the fiscal quarter ended January 31, 2017 . Accordingly, the 0.25% Senior Notes were not convertible at the holders option. In July 2016, in order to partially finance the acquisition of Demandware, we entered into a $500.0 million term loan (the Term Loan) which matures in July 2019 and bears interest at our option, at either a base rate plus a spread of 0.00% to 0.75% or an adjusted LIBOR rate plus a spread of 1.00% to 1.75%, in each case with such spread being determined based on the Companys consolidated leverage ratio for the preceding four fiscal quarter period. The Term Loan Credit Agreement contains customary affirmative and negative covenants, including covenants that limit or restrict us and our subsidiaries ability to, among other things, incur indebtedness, grant liens, merge or consolidate, dispose of assets, make investments, make acquisitions, enter into transactions with affiliates, pay dividends or make distributions and repurchase stock. We are also required to maintain compliance with a consolidated leverage ratio and a consolidated interest coverage ratio. The Term Loan Credit Agreement includes customary events of default. Under certain circumstances, a default interest rate will apply on all obligations during the existence of an event of default under the Term Loan Credit Agreement at a per annum rate equal to 2.00% above the applicable interest rate for any overdue principal and 2.00% above the rate applicable for base rate loans for any other overdue amounts. The occurrence of an event of default could result in the acceleration of obligations under the Term Loan Credit Agreement. We were in compliance with the Term Loan Credit Agreements covenants as of January 31, 2017 . In July 2016, we entered into a credit agreement (the Revolving Loan Credit Agreement), which provides for a $1.0 billion unsecured revolving credit facility (the Credit Facility) that matures in July 2021. We may use any future borrowings under the Credit Facility for refinancing other indebtedness, working capital, capital expenditures and other general corporate purposes, including permitted acquisitions. We may borrow amounts under the Credit Facility at any time during the term of the Revolving Loan Credit Agreement. As of January 31, 2017 , we had $200.0 million in outstanding borrowings under the Credit Facility. Subsequent to January 31, 2017 , we paid the remaining outstanding balance of the Credit Facility. The Revolving Loan Credit Agreement contains certain customary affirmative and negative covenants, including a consolidated leverage ratio covenant, a consolidated interest coverage ratio covenant, a limit on our ability to incur additional indebtedness, dispose of assets, make certain acquisition transactions, pay dividends or distributions, and certain other restrictions on our activities each defined specifically in the Revolving Loan Credit Agreement. We were in compliance with the Revolving Loan Credit Agreements covenants as of January 31, 2017 . In February 2015, we acquired 50 Fremont Street, a 41-story building totaling approximately 820,000 rentable square feet located in San Francisco, California (50 Fremont). At the time of the acquisition, we were leasing approximately 500,000 square feet of the available space in 50 Fremont. The total purchase price for 50 Fremont was $637.6 million. In financing the purchase price, we used $115.0 million of restricted cash on hand and assumed a $200.0 million loan secured by the property with the remainder paid in cash. In April 2016, we entered into an agreement with a third party provider for certain infrastructure services for a period of four years. The agreement provides that we will pay $96.0 million in fiscal 2018, $108.0 million in fiscal 2019 and $126.0 million in fiscal 2020. During fiscal 2017, we paid $70.0 million. Our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities are comprised primarily of corporate notes and other obligations, U.S. treasury securities, government obligations, collateralized mortgage obligations, mortgage backed securities, time deposits, money market mutual funds and municipal securities. As of January 31, 2017 , we have a total of $83.3 million in letters of credit outstanding in favor of certain landlords for office space. To date, no amounts have been drawn against the letters of credit, which renew annually and expire at various dates through December 2030. We do not have any special purpose entities, and other than operating leases for office space and computer equipment, we do not engage in off-balance sheet financing arrangements. Our principal commitments consist of obligations under leases for office space, co-location data center facilities, and our development and test data center, as well as leases for computer equipment, software, furniture and fixtures. At January 31, 2017 , the future non-cancelable minimum payments under these commitments were as follows (in thousands):  ##TABLE_START Contractual Obligations Payments Due by Period  Total  Less than 1 Year  1-3 Years  3-5 Years  More than 5 Years Capital lease obligations, including interest $ 436,747  $ 119,342  $ 317,369  $  $ Operating lease obligations:          Facilities space 2,536,933  257,387  569,210  507,519  1,202,817 Computer equipment and furniture and fixtures 382,215  205,863  176,352   0.25% Convertible Senior Notes, including interest 1,154,313  2,875  1,151,438   Loan assumed on 50 Fremont 200,000     200,000 Term loan 500,000   500,000   Revolving Credit Facility 200,000    200,000  Financing obligation - leased facility 322,340  21,437  44,206  45,984  210,713 Contractual commitments 365,200  122,660  239,558  2,982   $ 6,097,748  $ 729,564  $ 2,998,133  $ 756,521  $ 1,613,530 ##TABLE_ENDThe majority of our operating lease agreements provide us with the option to renew. Our future operating lease obligations would change if we exercised these options and if we entered into additional operating lease agreements as we expand our operations. The financing obligation above represents the total obligation for our lease of approximately 445,000 rentable square feet of office space in San Francisco, California. As of January 31, 2017 , $220.3 million of the total obligation noted above was recorded to Financing obligation - leased facility, of which the current portion is included in Accounts payable, accrued expenses and other liabilities and the non-current portion is included in Other noncurrent liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets. Purchase orders are not included in the table above. Our purchase orders represent authorizations to purchase rather than binding agreements. The contractual commitment amounts in the table above are associated with agreements that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms, including: fixed or minimum services to be used; fixed, minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. Obligations under contracts that we can cancel without a significant penalty are not included in the table above. In April 2014, we entered into an office lease agreement to lease approximately 732,000 rentable square feet of an office building located in San Francisco, California that is under construction. The lease payments associated with the lease will be approximately $590.0 million over the 15.5 year term of the lease, beginning in our second quarter of fiscal 2018, which is reflected above under Operating Leases. In February 2016, we entered into an agreement to sublease additional office space in New York, New York. The amounts associated with the agreement will be approximately $288.0 million over the approximately 12 year term of the agreement, beginning in our first quarter of fiscal 2018. In May 2016, we entered into an agreement to lease additional office space in Indianapolis, Indiana. The amounts associated with the agreement will be approximately $77.0 million over the approximately 13 year term of the agreement, beginning in our second quarter of fiscal 2018. During fiscal 2017 and in future fiscal years, we have made and expect to continue to make additional investments in our infrastructure to scale our operations and increase productivity. We plan to upgrade or replace various internal systems to scale with the overall growth of the Company. Additionally, we expect capital expenditures to be higher in absolute dollars and remain consistent as a percentage of total revenues in future periods as a result of continued office build-outs, other leasehold improvements and data center investments. In the future, we may enter into arrangements to acquire or invest in complementary businesses or joint ventures, services and technologies, and intellectual property rights. To facilitate these acquisitions or investments, we may seek additional equity or debt financing, which may not be available on terms favorable to us or at all, which may affect our ability to complete subsequent acquisitions or investments, and which may affect the risks of owning our common stock. We believe our existing cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities and cash provided by operating activities will be sufficient to meet our working capital, capital expenditure and debt repayment needs over the next 12 months.

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK ##TABLE_END Foreign Currency Exchange Risk We primarily conduct our business in the following locations: the United States, Europe, Canada, Asia, South America and Australia. The expanding global scope of our business exposes us to risk of fluctuations in foreign currency markets. This exposure is the result of selling in multiple currencies, growth in our international investments, including data center expansion, additional headcount in foreign countries, and operating in countries where the functional currency is the local currency. Specifically, our results of operations and cash flows are subject to fluctuations in the following currencies: the Euro, British Pound Sterling, Canadian Dollar, Australian Dollar and Japanese Yen against the United States Dollar (USD). These exposures may change over time as business practices evolve and economic conditions change. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates could have an adverse impact on our financial results and cash flows. Our European revenue, operating expenses and significant balance sheet accounts denominated in currencies other than the USD primarily flow through our United Kingdom subsidiary, which has a functional currency of the British Pound. This results in a two-step currency exchange process wherein the currencies in Europe other than the British Pound are first converted into the British Pound and then British Pounds are translated into USD for our Consolidated Financial Statements. As an example, revenues in France are translated from the Euro to the British Pound and then into the USD. Our Statement of Operations and balance sheet accounts are also impacted by the re-measurement of non-functional currency transactions such as USD denominated intercompany loans, cash accounts held by our overseas subsidiaries, accounts receivable denominated in foreign currencies, deferred revenue and accounts payable denominated in foreign currencies. Foreign Currency Transaction Risk Our foreign currency exposures typically arise from selling annual and multi-year subscriptions in multiple currencies, customer trade accounts, intercompany transfer pricing arrangements and other intercompany transactions. Our foreign currency management objective is to minimize the effect of fluctuations in foreign exchange rates on selected assets or liabilities without exposing us to additional risk associated with transactions that could be regarded as speculative. We pursue our objective by utilizing foreign currency forward contracts to offset foreign exchange risk. Our foreign currency forward contracts are generally short-term in duration. We neither use these foreign currency forward contracts for trading purposes nor do we currently designate these forward contracts as hedging instruments pursuant to Accounting Standards Codification 815 (ASC 815), Derivatives and Hedging. Accordingly, we record the fair values of these contracts as of the end of our reporting period to our consolidated balance sheet with changes in fair values recorded to our consolidated statement of operations. Given the short duration of the forward contracts, the amount recorded is not significant. Our ultimate realized gain or loss with respect to foreign currency exposures will generally depend on the size and type of cross-currency transactions that we enter into, the currency exchange rates associated with these exposures and changes in those rates, the net realized gain or loss on our foreign currency forward contracts and other factors. Foreign Currency Translation Risk Fluctuations in foreign currencies impact the amount of total assets, liabilities, revenues, operating expense and cash flows that we report for our foreign subsidiaries upon the translation of these amounts into U.S. Dollars. As the U.S. Dollar strengthened against certain international currencies over the past several months, the amounts of revenue and deferred revenue that we reported in U.S. Dollars for foreign subsidiaries that transact in international currencies were lower relative to what we would have reported using a constant currency rate. Interest Rate Sensitivity We had cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaling $2.2 billion at January 31, 2017 . This amount was invested primarily in money market funds, time deposits, corporate notes and bonds, government securities and other debt securities with credit ratings of at least BBB or better. The cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities are held for general corporate purposes including possible acquisitions of, or investments in, complementary businesses, services or technologies, working capital and capital expenditures. Our investments are made for capital preservation purposes. We do not enter into investments for trading or speculative purposes. Our cash equivalents and our portfolio of marketable securities are subject to market risk due to changes in interest rates. Fixed rate securities may have their market value adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates, while floating rate securities may produce less income than expected if interest rates fall. Due in part to these factors, our future investment income may fall short of expectations due to changes in interest rates or we may suffer losses in principal if we are forced to sell securities that decline in market value due to changes in interest rates. However because we classify our debt securities as available for sale, no gains or losses are recognized due to changes in interest rates unless such securities are sold prior to maturity or declines in fair value are determined to be other-than-temporary. Our fixed-income portfolio is subject to interest rate risk. An immediate increase or decrease in interest rates of 100-basis points at January 31, 2017 could result in a $13.0 million market value reduction or increase of the same amount. This estimate is based on a sensitivity model that measures market value changes when changes in interest rates occur. Fluctuations in the value of our investment securities caused by a change in interest rates (gains or losses on the carrying value) are recorded in other comprehensive income, and are realized only if we sell the underlying securities. At January 31, 2016 , we had cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaling $2.7 billion . The fixed-income portfolio was also subject to interest rate risk. Changes in interest rates of 100-basis points would have resulted in market value changes of $20.9 million . Market Risk and Market Interest Risk We deposit our cash with multiple financial institutions. In March 2013, we issued the 0.25% Senior Notes due April 1, 2018. Holders of the 0.25% Senior Notes may convert the 0.25% Senior Notes prior to maturity upon the occurrence of certain circumstances. Upon conversion, we would pay the holder an amount of cash equal to the principal amounts of the 0.25% Senior Notes and the amounts in excess of the principal amounts, if any, may be paid in cash or stock at our option. Concurrent with the issuance of the 0.25% Senior Notes, we entered into separate note hedging transactions and the sale of warrants. These separate transactions were completed to reduce the potential economic dilution from the conversion of the 0.25% Senior Notes. The 0.25% Senior Notes have a fixed annual interest rate of 0.25%, and therefore we do not have economic interest rate exposure on the 0.25% Senior Notes. However, the value of the 0.25% Senior Notes are exposed to interest rate risk. Generally, the fair values of our fixed interest rate 0.25% Senior Notes will increase as interest rates fall and decrease as interest rates rise. In addition, the fair value of our 0.25% Senior Notes is affected by our stock price. The principal balance of our 0.25% Senior Notes was $1.15 billion as of January 31, 2017 . The total estimated fair value of our 0.25% Senior Notes at January 31, 2017  was $1.5 billion . The fair value was determined based on the closing trading price per $100 of the 0.25% Senior Notes as of the last day of trading for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017 , which was $126.52.  In July 2016, we amended our credit agreement (the Revolving Loan Credit Agreement) to provide for a $1.0 billion unsecured revolving credit facility (the Credit Facility) that matures in July 2021. The borrowings under the Credit Facility bear interest, at our option, at a base rate plus a spread of 0.00% to 0.75% or an adjusted LIBOR rate plus a spread of 1.00% to 1.75%, in each case with such spread being determined based on our consolidated leverage ratio for the preceding four fiscal quarter period. Regardless of what amounts, if any, are outstanding under the Credit Facility, we are also obligated to pay an ongoing commitment fee at a rate of 0.125% to 0.25%, with such rate being based on the our consolidated leverage ratio for the preceding four fiscal quarter period, payable in arrears quarterly. As of January 31, 2017 , there was a $200.0 million outstanding borrowing amount under the Credit Agreement. The weighted average interest rate on the borrowings under the Credit Facility was 1.9% for fiscal 2017 . Subsequent to January 31, 2017 , we paid the remaining balance of the Credit Facility. In February 2015, we assumed a $200.0 million loan with the acquisition of 50 Fremont (the Loan). The Loan bears an interest rate of 3.75% per annum and is due in June 2023. The Loan requires interest only payments with the remaining principal due at maturity. The Loan can be prepaid at any time subject to a yield maintenance fee. The agreement governing the Loan contains certain customary affirmative and negative covenants that we were in compliance with as of January 31, 2017 . In July 2016, we entered into a $500.0 million term loan (the Term Loan) which matures in July 2019 and bears interest at our option, at either a base rate plus a spread of 0.00% to 0.75% or an adjusted LIBOR rate plus a spread of 1.00% to 1.75%, in each case with such spread being determined based on the Companys consolidated leverage ratio for the preceding four fiscal quarter period. We entered into the Term Loan for purposes of partially funding the acquisition of Demandware. Interest is due and payable in arrears quarterly for loans bearing interest at a rate based on the base rate and at the end of an interest period in the case of loans bearing interest at the adjusted LIBOR rate. The Term Loan is payable in July 2019, with the outstanding principal amount of the term loan being due and payable at maturity. By entering into the Term Loan, we have assumed risks associated with variable interest rates based upon a variable base rate or LIBOR. The weighted average interest rate on the Term Loan was 1.8 % as of January 31, 2017 . Changes in the overall level of interest rates affect the interest expense that we recognize in our statements of operations. The bank counterparties to our derivative contracts potentially expose us to credit-related losses in the event of their nonperformance. To mitigate that risk, we only contract with counterparties who meet the minimum requirements under our counterparty risk assessment process. We monitor ratings, credit spreads and potential downgrades on at least a quarterly basis. Based on our on-going assessment of counterparty risk, we adjust our exposure to various counterparties. We generally enter into master netting arrangements, which reduce credit risk by permitting net settlement of transactions with the same counterparty. However, we do not have any master netting arrangements in place with collateral features. Our strategic investments portfolio consists of investments in over 180 privately held companies, primarily comprised of ISVs and system integrators. We invest in early-to-late stage technology and professional cloud service companies across the globe to support our key business initiatives, which include, among other things, extending the capabilities of our platform and CRM offerings, increasing the ecosystem of enterprise cloud companies and partners, accelerating the adoption of cloud technologies and creating the next-generation of mobile applications and connected products. We invest in both domestic and international companies and currently hold investments in all of our regions: the Americas, Europe and Asia Pacific. Our investments in these companies range from $0.2 million to over $70.0 million , with 16 investments individually equal to or in excess of $10 million. As of January 31, 2017 and January 31, 2016 the carrying value of our investments in privately held companies was $526.0 million and $504.5 million , respectively. The estimated fair value of our investments in privately held companies was $758.3 million and $714.1 million as of January 31, 2017 and January 31, 2016 , respectively. The financial success of our investment in any company is typically dependent on a liquidity event, such as a public offering, acquisition or other favorable market event reflecting appreciation to the cost of our initial investment. If we determine that any of our investments in such companies have experienced a decline in fair value, we may be required to record an impairment that is other than temporary, which could be material. We have in the past written off the full value of specific investments. Similar situations could occur in the future and negatively impact our financial results. All of our investments are subject to a risk of partial or total loss of investment capital.  ##TABLE_START ", "8": " ITEM 8.

Our audits also included the financial statement schedule listed in the Index at Item 15(a)2. These financial statements and schedule are the responsibility of the Companys management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and schedule based on our audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of salesforce.com, inc. at January 31, 2017 and 2016 and the consolidated results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended January 31, 2017, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Also, in our opinion, the related financial statement schedule, when considered in relation to the basic financial statements taken as a whole, presents fairly in all material respects the information set forth therein. As discussed in Notes 1 and 11 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company changed its method of accounting for share-based payments to employees as a result of the adoption of the amendments to FASB Accounting Standards Codification resulting from Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-09, Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting, effective February 1, 2016. We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), salesforce.com, inc.s internal control over financial reporting as of January 31, 2017, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations on the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) and our report dated March 6, 2017 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon. ##TABLE_START       /s/ Ernst  Young LLP ##TABLE_ENDRedwood City, California March 6, 2017 Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm The Board of Directors and Stockholders of salesforce.com, inc. We have audited salesforce.com, inc.s internal control over financial reporting as of January 31, 2017 based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the COSO criteria). Salesforce.com, inc.s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Managements Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the companys internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. A companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. As indicated in the accompanying Managements Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting, managements assessment of and conclusion on the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting did not include the internal controls of Demandware, Inc., which is included in the January 31, 2017 consolidated financial statements of salesforce.com, inc. and constituted two percent of both consolidated total and net assets as of January 31, 2017, and one percent of consolidated total revenues for the year then ended. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting of salesforce.com, inc. also did not include an evaluation of the internal control over financial reporting of Demandware, Inc.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements 1. Summary of Business and Significant Accounting Policies Description of Business Salesforce.com, inc. (the Company) is a leading provider of enterprise cloud computing solutions, with a focus on customer relationship management, or CRM. The Company introduced its first CRM solution in February 2000, and has since expanded its service offerings with new editions, features and platform capabilities. Our core mission is to help our customers transform by empowering them to connect with their customers in entirely new ways. Our Customer Success Platform - including sales force automation, customer service and support, marketing automation, digital commerce, community management, analytics, application development, Internet of Things (IoT) integration and collaborative productivity tools - provide the tools customers need to succeed in a digital world. Fiscal Year The Companys fiscal year ends on January 31. References to fiscal 2017, for example, refer to the fiscal year ending January 31, 2017 . Use of Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (U.S. GAAP) requires management to make estimates and assumptions in the Companys consolidated financial statements and notes thereto. Significant estimates and assumptions made by management include the determination of: ##TABLE_START  the best estimate of selling price of the deliverables included in multiple deliverable revenue arrangements, ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed for business combinations, ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  the recognition, measurement and valuation of current and deferred income taxes, ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  the fair value of certain stock awards issued, ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  the useful lives of intangible assets, property and equipment and building and structural components, and ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  the valuation of strategic investments and the determination of other-than-temporary impairments. ##TABLE_END Actual results could differ materially from those estimates. The Company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable, the result of which forms the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities. Principles of Consolidation The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. Segments The Company operates as one operating segment. Operating segments are defined as components of an enterprise for which separate financial information is evaluated regularly by the chief operating decision maker, who is the chief executive officer, in deciding how to allocate resources and assessing performance. Over the past few years, including fiscal 2017, the Company has completed a number of acquisitions. These acquisitions have allowed the Company to expand its offerings, presence and reach in various market segments of the enterprise cloud computing market. While the Company has offerings in multiple enterprise cloud computing market segments, including as a result of the Company's acquisitions, the Companys business operates in one operating segment because the majority of the Company's offerings operate on a single platform and are deployed in an identical way, and  the Companys chief operating decision maker evaluates the Companys financial information and resources and assesses the performance of these resources on a consolidated basis. Since the Company operates in one operating segment, all required financial segment information can be found in the consolidated financial statements. Concentrations of Credit Risk and Significant Customers The Companys financial instruments that are exposed to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities and trade accounts receivable. In addition, in connection with the Company's 0.25% Senior Notes, the Company entered into convertible note hedge transactions with respect to its common stock which are exposed to concentrations of credit risk. Collateral is not required for accounts receivable or the note hedge transactions. The Company maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts receivable balances. This allowance is based upon historical loss patterns, the number of days that billings are past due and an evaluation of the potential risk of loss associated with delinquent accounts. Receivables are written-off and charged against its recorded allowance when the Company has exhausted collection efforts without success. No single customer accounted for more than five percent of accounts receivable at January 31, 2017 and 2016 . No single customer accounted for five percent or more of total revenue during fiscal 2017 , 2016 and 2015 . Geographic Locations As of January 31, 2017 and 2016 , assets located outside the Americas were 12 percent and 11 percent of total assets, respectively. As of January 31, 2017 and 2016 , assets located in the United States were 86 percent and 87 percent of total assets, respectively. Revenues by geographical region are as follows (in thousands):  ##TABLE_START   Fiscal Year Ended January 31,     Americas  $ 6,224,971  $ 4,910,745  $ 3,868,329 Europe  1,373,547  1,162,808  984,919 Asia Pacific  793,466  593,663  520,338  $ 8,391,984  $ 6,667,216  $ 5,373,586 ##TABLE_ENDAmericas revenue attributed to the United States was approximately 96 percent , 95 percent and 94 percent in fiscal 2017 , 2016 and 2015 , respectively. No other country represented more than ten percent of total revenue during fiscal 2017 , 2016 or 2015 . Revenue Recognition The Company derives its revenues from two sources: (1) subscription revenues, which are comprised of subscription fees from customers accessing the Companys enterprise cloud computing services and from customers paying for additional support beyond the standard support that is included in the basic subscription fees; and (2) related professional services such as process mapping, project management, implementation services and other revenue. Other revenue consists primarily of training fees. The Company commences revenue recognition when all of the following conditions are satisfied: ##TABLE_START  there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  the service has been or is being provided to the customer; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  the collection of the fees is reasonably assured; and ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  the amount of fees to be paid by the customer is fixed or determinable. ##TABLE_END The Companys subscription service arrangements are non-cancelable and do not contain refund-type provisions. Subscription and Support Revenues Subscription and support revenues are recognized ratably over the contract terms beginning on the commencement date of each contract, which is the date the Companys service is made available to customers. Amounts that have been invoiced are recorded in accounts receivable and in deferred revenue or revenue, depending on whether the revenue recognition criteria have been met. Professional Services and Other Revenues The Companys professional services contracts are either on a time and materials, fixed fee basis or subscription basis. These revenues are recognized as the services are rendered for time and materials contracts, when the milestones are achieved and accepted by the customer or on a proportional performance basis for fixed price contracts and ratably over the contract term for subscription professional services contracts. The milestone method for revenue recognition is used when there is substantive uncertainty at the date the contract is entered into whether the milestone will be achieved. Training revenues are recognized as the services are performed. Multiple Deliverable Arrangements The Company enters into arrangements with multiple deliverables that generally include multiple subscriptions, premium support and professional services. If the deliverables have standalone value at contract inception, the Company accounts for each deliverable separately. Subscription services have standalone value as such services are often sold separately. In determining whether professional services have standalone value, the Company considers the following factors for each professional services agreement: availability of the services from other vendors, the nature of the professional services, the timing of when the professional services contract was signed in comparison to the subscription service start date and the contractual dependence of the subscription service on the customers satisfaction with the professional services work. To date, the Company has concluded that all of the professional services included in multiple deliverable arrangements executed have standalone value. Multiple deliverables included in an arrangement are separated into different units of accounting and the arrangement consideration is allocated to the identified separate units based on a relative selling price hierarchy. The Company determines the relative selling price for a deliverable based on its vendor-specific objective evidence of selling price (VSOE), if available, or its best estimate of selling price (BESP), if VSOE is not available. The Company has determined that third-party evidence of selling price (TPE) is not a practical alternative due to differences in its service offerings compared to other parties and the availability of relevant third-party pricing information. The amount of revenue allocated to delivered items is limited by contingent revenue, if any. For certain professional services, the Company has established VSOE as a consistent number of standalone sales of these deliverables have been priced within a reasonably narrow range. The Company has not established VSOE for its subscription services due to lack of pricing consistency, the introduction of new services and other factors. Accordingly, the Company uses its BESP to determine the relative selling price for its subscription services. The Company determines BESP by considering its overall pricing objectives and market conditions. Significant pricing practices taken into consideration include the Companys discounting practices, the size and volume of the Companys transactions, the customer demographic, the geographic area where services are sold, price lists, its go-to-market strategy, historical standalone sales and contract prices. The determination of BESP is made through consultation with and approval by the Companys management, taking into consideration the go-to-market strategy. As the Companys go-to-market strategies evolve, the Company may modify its pricing practices in the future, which could result in changes in relative selling prices, including both VSOE and BESP. Deferred Revenue The deferred revenue balance does not represent the total contract value of annual or multi-year, non-cancelable subscription agreements. Deferred revenue primarily consists of billings or payments received in advance of revenue recognition from subscription services described above and is recognized as the revenue recognition criteria are met. The Company generally invoices customers in annual installments. The deferred revenue balance is influenced by several factors, including seasonality, the compounding effects of renewals, invoice duration, invoice timing, dollar size and new business linearity within the quarter. Deferred revenue that will be recognized during the succeeding twelve month period is recorded as current deferred revenue and the remaining portion is recorded as noncurrent. Deferred Commissions Deferred commissions are the incremental costs that are directly associated with non-cancelable subscription contracts with customers and consist of sales commissions paid to the Companys direct sales force. The commissions are deferred and amortized over the non-cancelable terms of the related customer contracts, which are typically 12 to 36 months . The commission payments are paid in full the month after the customers service commences. The deferred commission amounts are recoverable through the future revenue streams under the non-cancelable customer contracts. The Company believes this is the preferable method of accounting as the commission charges are so closely related to the revenue from the non-cancelable customer contracts that they should be recorded as an asset and charged to expense over the same period that the subscription revenue is recognized. Amortization of deferred commissions is included in marketing and sales expense in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations. Cash and Cash Equivalents The Company considers all highly liquid investments purchased with an original maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents. Cash and cash equivalents are stated at fair value. Marketable Securities Securities are classified as available for sale and are carried at fair value, with the change in unrealized gains and losses, net of tax, reported as a separate component on the consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss). Fair value is determined based on quoted market rates when observable or utilizing data points that are observable, such as quoted prices, interest rates and yield curves. Declines in fair value judged to be other-than-temporary on securities available for sale are included as a component of investment income. In order to determine whether a decline in value is other-than-temporary, the Company evaluates, among other factors: the duration and extent to which the fair value has been less than the carrying value and its intent and ability to retain the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in fair value. The cost of securities sold is based on the specific-identification method. Interest on securities classified as available for sale is also included as a component of investment income. Strategic Investments The Company holds certain marketable and non-marketable equity securities which are accounted for using the cost method of accounting. Marketable equity securities are measured using quoted prices in their respective active markets and the non-marketable equity securities are recorded at cost. Equity investments without readily determinable fair values for which we do not have the ability to exercise significant influence are accounted for using the cost method of accounting and classified as strategic investments on the consolidated balance sheets. Marketable securities are recorded at fair value with changes in fair value recorded through accumulated other comprehensive income. Under the cost method of accounting, the non-marketable securities are carried at cost and are adjusted only for other-than-temporary impairments, certain distributions and additional investments. Fair Value Measurement The Company measures its cash equivalents, marketable securities and foreign currency derivative contracts at fair value. The additional disclosures regarding the Companys fair value measurements are included in Note 2 Investments. Property and Equipment Property and equipment are stated at cost. Depreciation is calculated on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of those assets as follows:  ##TABLE_START Computers, equipment and software 3 to 9 years Furniture and fixtures 5 years Leasehold improvements Shorter of the estimated lease term or 10 years Building and structural components Average weighted useful life of 32 years Building- leased facility 27 years Building improvements 10 years ##TABLE_ENDWhen assets are retired or otherwise disposed of, the cost and accumulated depreciation and amortization are removed from their respective accounts and any loss on such retirement is reflected in operating expenses. Capitalized Software The Company capitalizes costs related to its enterprise cloud computing services and certain projects for internal use incurred during the application development stage. Costs related to preliminary project activities and post implementation activities are expensed as incurred. Internal-use software is amortized on a straight-line basis over its estimated useful life, which is generally three to five years. Management evaluates the useful lives of these assets on an annual basis and tests for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances occur that could impact the recoverability of these assets. Intangible Assets acquired through Business Combinations Intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives. Each period the Company evaluates the estimated remaining useful life of its intangible assets and whether events or changes in circumstances warrant a revision to the remaining period of amortization. Impairment Assessment The Company evaluates intangible assets and long-lived assets for possible impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable. This includes but is not limited to significant adverse changes in business climate, market conditions, or other events that indicate an asset's carrying amount may not be recoverable. Recoverability of these assets is measured by comparison of the carrying amount of each asset to the future undiscounted cash flows the asset is expected to generate. If the undiscounted cash flows used in the test for recoverability are less than the carrying amount of these assets, then the carrying amount of such assets is reduced to fair value. The Company evaluates and tests the recoverability of its goodwill for impairment at least annually during our fourth quarter of each fiscal year or more often if and when circumstances indicate that goodwill may not be recoverable. There was no impairment of intangible assets, long-lived assets or goodwill during fiscal 2017 , 2016 or 2015 . Business Combinations The Company uses its best estimates and assumptions to accurately assign fair value to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date. The Companys estimates are inherently uncertain and subject to refinement. During the measurement period, which may be up to one year from the acquisition date, the Company may record adjustments to the fair value of these tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed, with the corresponding offset to goodwill. In addition, uncertain tax positions and tax-related valuation allowances are initially established in connection with a business combination as of the acquisition date. The Company continues to collect information and reevaluates these estimates and assumptions quarterly and records any adjustments to the Companys preliminary estimates to goodwill provided that the Company is within the measurement period. Upon the conclusion of the measurement period or final determination of the fair value of assets acquired or liabilities assumed, whichever comes first, any subsequent adjustments are recorded to the Companys consolidated statements of operations. In the event that the Company acquires an entity in which the Company previously held a strategic investment, the difference between the fair value of the shares as of the date of the acquisition and the carrying value of the strategic investment is recorded as a gain or loss and disclosed separately within the statements of operations. Leases and Asset Retirement Obligations The Company categorizes leases at their inception as either operating or capital leases. In certain lease agreements, the Company may receive rent holidays and other incentives. The Company recognizes lease costs on a straight-line basis once control of the space is achieved, without regard to deferred payment terms such as rent holidays that defer the commencement date of required payments. Additionally, incentives received are treated as a reduction of costs over the term of the agreement. The Company establishes assets and liabilities for the present value of estimated future costs to retire long-lived assets at the termination or expiration of a lease. Such assets are depreciated over the lease period into operating expense, and the recorded liabilities are accreted to the future value of the estimated retirement costs. In the event the Company is the deemed owner for accounting purposes during construction, the Company records assets and liabilities for the estimated construction costs incurred under build-to-suit lease arrangements to the extent it is involved in the construction of structural improvements or takes construction risk prior to commencement of a lease. The Company additionally has entered into subleases for unoccupied leased office space. To the extent there are losses associated with the sublease, they are recognized in the period the sublease is executed. Gains are recognized over the sublease term. Any sublease payments received in excess of the straight-line rent payments for the sublease are recorded in other income (expense). Accounting for Stock-Based Expense The Company recognizes stock-based expenses related to stock options and restricted stock awards on a straight-line basis, net of estimated forfeitures, over the requisite service period of the awards, which is generally the vesting term of four years . The Company recognizes stock-based expenses related to shares issued pursuant to its 2004 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (ESPP) on a straight-line basis over the offering period, which is 12 months . Stock-based expenses related to performance share grants are measured based on grant date fair value and expensed on a straight-line basis over the service period of the awards, which is generally the vesting term of three years . The Company, at times, grant unvested restricted shares to employee stockholders of certain acquired companies in lieu of cash considerations. These awards are generally subject to continued post-acquisition employment, therefore the Company has accounted for them as post-acquisition stock-based expense. The Company recognizes stock-based expenses equal to the grant date fair value of the restricted stock awards on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period of the awards. Advertising Expenses Advertising is expensed as incurred. Advertising expense was $350.3 million , $315.6 million and $203.6 million for fiscal 2017 , 2016 and 2015 , respectively. Income Taxes The Company uses the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on temporary differences between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax laws is recognized in the consolidated statement of operations in the period that includes the enactment date. The Companys tax positions are subject to income tax audits by multiple tax jurisdictions throughout the world. The Company recognizes the tax benefit of an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the position is sustainable upon examination by the taxing authority, solely based on its technical merits. The tax benefit recognized is measured as the largest amount of benefit which is greater than 50 percent likely to be realized upon settlement with the taxing authority. The Company recognizes interest accrued and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in the income tax provision. Valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amounts that are more likely than not expected to be realized based on the weighting of positive and negative evidence. Future realization of deferred tax assets ultimately depends on the existence of sufficient taxable income of the appropriate character (for example, ordinary income or capital gain) within the carryback or carryforward periods available under the applicable tax law. The Company regularly reviews the deferred tax assets for recoverability based on historical taxable income, projected future taxable income, the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences and tax planning strategies. The Companys judgments regarding future profitability may change due to many factors, including future market conditions and the ability to successfully execute its business plans and/or tax planning strategies. Should there be a change in the ability to recover deferred tax assets, the tax provision would increase or decrease in the period in which the assessment is changed. Foreign Currency Translation The functional currency of the Companys major foreign subsidiaries is generally the local currency. Adjustments resulting from translating foreign functional currency financial statements into U.S. dollars are recorded as a separate component on the consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss). Foreign currency transaction gains and losses are included in net income (loss) for the period. All assets and liabilities denominated in a foreign currency are translated into U.S. dollars at the exchange rate on the balance sheet date. Revenues and expenses are translated at the average exchange rate during the period. Equity transactions are translated using historical exchange rates. Warranties and Indemnification The Companys enterprise cloud computing services are typically warranted to perform in a manner consistent with general industry standards that are reasonably applicable and materially in accordance with the Companys online help documentation under normal use and circumstances. The Companys arrangements generally include certain provisions for indemnifying customers against liabilities if its products or services infringe a third partys intellectual property rights. To date, the Company has not incurred any material costs as a result of such obligations and has not accrued any material liabilities related to such obligations in the accompanying consolidated financial statements. The Company has also agreed to indemnify its directors and executive officers for costs associated with any fees, expenses, judgments, fines and settlement amounts incurred by any of these persons in any action or proceeding to which any of those persons is, or is threatened to be, made a party by reason of the persons service as a director or officer, including any action by the Company, arising out of that persons services as the Companys director or officer or that persons services provided to any other company or enterprise at the Companys request. The Company maintains director and officer insurance coverage that would generally enable the Company to recover a portion of any future amounts paid. The Company may also be subject to indemnification obligations by law with respect to the actions of its employees under certain circumstances and in certain jurisdictions. New Accounting Pronouncements Adopted in Fiscal 2017 In April 2015, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2015-03, Interest - Imputation of Interest (Subtopic 835-30): Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs (ASU 2015-03), which simplifies the presentation of debt issuance costs by requiring debt issuance costs to be presented as a deduction from the corresponding debt liability rather than an asset that is amortized. However, ASU 2015-03 does not address deferred issuance costs for line-of-credit arrangements; therefore, in August 2015, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2015-15, Interest-Imputation of Interest: Presentation and Subsequent Measurement of Debt Issuance Costs Associated with Line-of-Credit Arrangements (ASU 2015-15). ASU 2015-15 allows an entity to defer debt issuance costs associated with line-of-credit arrangements, including arrangements with no outstanding borrowings, and classify them as an asset, and amortize them over the term of the arrangements. The recognition and measurement guidance for debt issuance costs is not affected by the standards. These standards are adopted on a retrospective basis in the period of adoption. The Company adopted the standards in fiscal 2017. Upon adoption, the unamortized debt issuance costs previously reported in Other assets, net, with a carrying amount of approximately $7.9 million at January 31, 2016, were reclassified and presented as a deduction of the corresponding liabilities, Convertible 0.25% senior notes, net, Term Loan, and Loan assumed on 50 Fremont.  In September 2015, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2015-16, Simplifying the Accounting for Measurement-Period Adjustments (Topic 805) (ASU 2015-16), which eliminates the requirement to restate prior period financial statements for measurement period adjustments in business combinations. ASU 2015-16 requires that the cumulative impact of a measurement period adjustment (including the impact on prior periods) be recognized in the reporting period in which the adjustment is identified. The Company adopted this standard during the three months ended April 30, 2016 and there was no material impact of this on the Company's financial statements. In March 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-09, Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Shared-Based Payment Accounting (ASU 2016-09), which simplifies and improves several aspects of the accounting for employee share-based payment transactions for public entities. The new guidance requires companies to record excess tax benefits and tax deficiencies as income tax benefit or expense in the statement of operations when the awards vest or are settled, and eliminates the requirement to reclassify cash flows related to excess tax benefits from operating activities to financing activities on the statement of cash flows. The Company adopted the standard in the three months ended April 30, 2016. Upon adoption, the Company recognized the previously unrecognized excess tax benefits using the modified retrospective transition method, which resulted in a cumulative-effect adjustment of $8.7 million to accumulated deficit. This adjustment reduced the accumulated deficit balance for fiscal 2017. The previously unrecognized excess tax effects were recorded as a deferred tax asset, which was almost fully offset by a valuation allowance. Without the valuation allowance, the Companys deferred tax assets would have increased by $614.5 million . The Company also elected to apply the change in presentation to the statements of cash flows retrospectively and no longer classified the excess tax benefits from employee stock plans as a reduction from operating cash flows for all periods presented. As a result of the adoption of ASU 2016-09, the consolidated statements of cash flows for fiscal 2016 and 2015 were adjusted as follows: $59.5 million and $7.7 million increases to net cash provided by operating activities, respectively, and $59.5 million and $7.7 million decrease to net cash used in financing activities, respectively. Pending Accounting Pronouncements In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) (ASU 2014-09) which amended the existing FASB Accounting Standards Codification. This standard replaces existing revenue recognition guidance with a comprehensive revenue measurement and recognition standard and expanded disclosure requirements. The standard also provides guidance on the recognition of costs related to obtaining customer contracts. ASU 2014-09, as amended, will be effective for the beginning of fiscal 2019, including interim periods within that reporting period. The Company currently anticipates adopting the standard using the full retrospective method to restate each prior reporting period presented. The Company's ability to adopt using the full retrospective method is dependent upon system readiness for both revenue and commissions and the completion of the analysis of information necessary to restate prior period financial statements. The Company is continuing to assess the impact of adopting ASU 2014-09 on its financial position, results of operations, cash flows and related disclosures and has not yet determined whether the effect will be material. Additionally, as the Company continues to assess the new standard along with industry trends and additional interpretive guidance, the Company may adjust its implementation plan accordingly. The Company believes that the new standard will impact the following policies and disclosures: ##TABLE_START  The removal of the current limitation on contingent revenue may result in revenue being recognized earlier for certain contracts; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Allocation of revenue across different clouds and professional services; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Estimation of variable consideration for arrangements with overage fees; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Required disclosures including information about the remaining transaction price and when the Company expects to recognize revenue; and ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Accounting for deferred commissions including costs that qualify for deferral and the amortization period. ##TABLE_END The commission accounting under the new standard is significantly different than the Company's current capitalization policy. The new standard will result in additional types of costs that will be capitalized. Additionally, all amounts capitalized will be amortized over a period longer than the Company's current policy of amortizing the deferred amounts over the specific revenue contract terms. In January 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-01, Financial Instrument-Overall (Subtopic 825-10) (ASU 2016-01), which requires entities to measure equity instruments at fair value and recognize any changes in fair value in net income. However, for equity investments that do not have readily determinable fair values and do not qualify for the existing practical expedient, the investments will be measured at cost, less any impairment, plus or minus changes resulting from observable price changes in orderly transactions for the identical or a similar investment of the same issuer. The new standard is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017 and early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of ASU 2016-01, including the impact to its marketable securities and strategic investments. The adoption could have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements. In February 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842) (ASU 2016-02), which requires lessees to put most leases on their balance sheets but recognize the expenses on their income statements in a manner similar to current practice. ASU 2016-02 states that a lessee would recognize a lease liability for the obligation to make lease payments and a right-to-use asset for the right to use the underlying asset for the lease term. The new standard is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2018 and early adoption is permitted. The Company expects its leases designated as operating leases in Note 13, Commitments, will be reported on the consolidated balance sheets upon adoption. The Company is currently evaluating the impact to its consolidated financial statements as it relates to other aspects of the business. In October 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-16, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Intra-Entity Transfers of Assets Other Than Inventory (ASU 2016-16), which requires entities to recognize the income tax consequences of an intra-entity transfer of an asset, other than inventory, when the transfer occurs. The new standard is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017, with early adoption permitted as of the beginning of a fiscal year. The Company plans to adopt the new standard in its first quarter of fiscal 2019 and does not expect it to have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements. Reclassifications Certain reclassifications to fiscal 2016 balances were made to conform to the current period presentation in the Balance Sheet. These reclassifications include short-term marketable securities, marketable securities, noncurrent capitalized software, net, intangible assets acquired from business combinations, net and other assets, net. 2. Investments Marketable Securities The Company considers all its marketable debt securities as available for use in current operations, including those with maturity dates beyond one year, and therefore classifies these securities within current assets on the consolidated balance sheets. Marketable securities are carried at fair value, with the unrealized gains and losses, net of income taxes, reflected in accumulated other comprehensive income until realized. For the purposes of computing realized and unrealized gains and losses, cost is determined on a specific identification basis. At January 31, 2017 , marketable securities consisted of the following (in thousands):  ##TABLE_START Investments classified as Marketable Securities Amortized Cost  Unrealized Gains  Unrealized Losses  Fair Value Corporate notes and obligations $ 321,284  $  $ (1,531 )  $ 320,640 U.S. treasury securities 62,429   (674 )  61,823 Mortgage backed obligations 74,882   (669 )  74,252 Asset backed securities 101,913   (197 )  101,790 Municipal securities 33,523   (183 )  33,375 Foreign government obligations 10,491   (36 )  10,458 Total marketable securities $ 604,522 $ 1,106 $ (3,290 ) $ 602,338 ##TABLE_ENDAt January 31, 2016 , marketable securities consisted of the following (in thousands):  ##TABLE_START Investments classified as Marketable Securities Amortized Cost  Unrealized Gains  Unrealized Losses  Fair Value Corporate notes and obligations $ 949,266  $ 1,398  $ (2,983 )  $ 947,681 U.S. treasury securities 157,625   (56 )  157,944 Mortgage backed obligations 104,242   (323 )  104,025 Asset backed securities 271,292   (226 )  271,252 Municipal securities 44,934   (6 )  45,137 Foreign government obligations 18,014   (5 )  18,051 U.S. agency obligations 16,076   (6 )  16,086 Covered bonds 6,690    6,838 Total marketable securities $ 1,568,139 $ 2,480 $ (3,605 ) $ 1,567,014 ##TABLE_ENDThe contractual maturities of the investments classified as marketable securities is as follows (in thousands):  ##TABLE_START  As of January 31,       Due within 1 year $ 104,631  $ 309,944 Due in 1 year through 5 years 494,127  1,240,711 Due in 5 years through 10 years 3,580  16,359  $ 602,338  $ 1,567,014 ##TABLE_ENDAs of January 31, 2017 , the following marketable securities were in an unrealized loss position (in thousands):  ##TABLE_START  Less than 12 Months  12 Months or Greater  Total  Fair Value  Unrealized Losses  Fair Value  Unrealized Losses  Fair Value  Unrealized Losses Corporate notes and obligations $ 121,810  $ (1,528 )  $ 1,997  $ (3 )  $ 123,807  $ (1,531 ) U.S. treasury securities 49,945  (674 )    49,945  (674 ) Mortgage backed obligations 60,187  (669 )    60,187  (669 ) Asset backed securities 51,420  (187 )  1,193  (10 )  52,613  (197 ) Municipal securities 20,457  (183 )    20,457  (183 ) Foreign government obligations 8,280  (36 )    8,280  (36 )  $ 312,099  $ (3,277 )  $ 3,190  $ (13 )  $ 315,289  $ (3,290 ) ##TABLE_ENDThe unrealized loss for each individual fixed rate marketable securities was less than $0.2 million . The Company does not believe any of the unrealized losses represent an other-than-temporary impairment based on its evaluation of available evidence as of January 31, 2017 , such as the Company's intent to hold and whether it is more likely than not that the Company will be required to sell the investment before recovery of the investment's amortized basis. The Company expects to receive the full principal and interest on all of these marketable securities. Investment Income Investment income consists of interest income, realized gains, and realized losses on the Companys cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities. The components of investment income are presented below (in thousands):  ##TABLE_START   Fiscal Year Ended January 31,     Interest income  $ 21,901  $ 14,146  $ 10,129 Realized gains  7,858  3,287  Realized losses  (2,385 )  (2,092 )  (608 ) Total investment income  $ 27,374  $ 15,341  $ 10,038 ##TABLE_ENDReclassification adjustments out of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) into net income (loss) were immaterial for fiscal 2017 , 2016 and 2015 , respectively. Strategic Investments As of January 31, 2017 , the Company had six investments in marketable equity securities with a fair value of $41.0 million , which include an unrealized gain of $24.5 million . As of January 31, 2016 , the Company had six investments in marketable equity securities with a fair value of $16.2 million , which included an unrealized gain of $8.5 million . The change in the fair value of the investments in publicly held companies is recorded in the consolidated balance sheets within strategic investments and accumulated other comprehensive loss. The Companys interest in non-marketable debt and equity securities consists of noncontrolling equity investments in privately held companies. The Companys investments in these privately held companies are reported at cost or marked down to fair value when an event or circumstance indicates an other-than-temporary decline in value has occurred. These investments are valued using significant unobservable inputs or data in an inactive market and the valuation requires the Company's judgment due to the absence of market prices and inherent lack of liquidity. Fair value is not estimated if there are no identified events or changes in circumstances that may have an effect on the fair value of the investment. As of January 31, 2017 and 2016 , the carrying value of the Companys non-marketable debt and equity securities was $526.0 million and $504.5 million , respectively. The estimated fair value of the non-marketable debt and equity securities was approximately $758.3 million and $714.1 million as of January 31, 2017 and January 31, 2016 , respectively. These investments are measured using the cost method of accounting, therefore the unrealized gains of $232.3 million and $209.6 million as of January 31, 2017 and January 31, 2016 , respectively, are not recorded in the consolidated financial statements. Strategic investments consisted of the following (in thousands): ##TABLE_START Description  Balance at beginning of year  Additions  Sales, dispositions and fair market value adjustments (1)  Balance at end of year Fiscal year ended January 31, 2017  $ 520,721  110,329  (64,097 )  $ 566,953 Fiscal year ended January 31, 2016  $ 175,774  386,219  (41,272 )  $ 520,721 ##TABLE_END(1) Amounts include the release of the cost-basis and the current unrealized gain or loss balance recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss when shares of a publicly-held investment are sold, disposition-related reductions of a cost-basis investment if a privately-held company within the portfolio is acquired by another company, fair market value adjustments such as cost basis reductions related to impairments that are other-than-temporary and unrealized gains or losses related to investments held in publicly traded companies. The carrying value of the Companys strategic investments is affected by various events such as entering into new investments, disposition-related reductions of a cost-basis investment if a privately-held company within the portfolio is acquired by another company, fair market value adjustments including impairments or initial public offerings. The cash inflows from exits and cash outflows from new investments are disclosed as Strategic investments, net, within the investing activities section of the Statement of Cash Flows and any gains or losses or fair market value adjustments are recorded within the operating activities of the Statement of Cash Flows for each of the respective fiscal year periods. 3. Derivatives Derivative Financial Instruments The Company enters into foreign currency derivative contracts with financial institutions to reduce the risk that its cash flows and earnings will be adversely affected by foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. The Company uses forward currency derivative contracts to minimize the Companys exposure to balances primarily denominated in British Pound Sterling, the Euro and Japanese Yen. The Companys foreign currency derivative contracts, which are not designated as hedging instruments, are used to reduce the exchange rate risk associated primarily with intercompany receivables and payables. The Companys derivative financial instruments program is not designated for trading or speculative purposes. As of January 31, 2017 and 2016 , the foreign currency derivative contracts that were not settled were recorded at fair value on the consolidated balance sheets. Foreign currency derivative contracts are marked-to-market at the end of each reporting period with gains and losses recognized as other expense to offset the gains or losses resulting from the settlement or remeasurement of the underlying foreign currency denominated receivables and payables. While the contract or notional amount is often used to express the volume of foreign currency derivative contracts, the amounts potentially subject to credit risk are generally limited to the amounts, if any, by which the counterparties obligations under the agreements exceed the obligations of the Company to the counterparties. Details on outstanding foreign currency derivative contracts related primarily to intercompany receivables and payables are presented below (in thousands):  ##TABLE_START  As of January 31,   Notional amount of foreign currency derivative contracts $ 1,280,953  $ 1,274,515 Fair value of foreign currency derivative contracts $ 10,205  $ (9,294 ) ##TABLE_ENDThe fair value of the Companys outstanding derivative instruments are summarized below (in thousands):  ##TABLE_START   Fair Value of Derivative Instruments   As of January 31,   Balance Sheet Location  Derivative Assets     Derivatives not designated as hedging instruments:     Foreign currency derivative contracts Prepaid expenses and other current assets $ 13,238  $ 4,731 Derivative Liabilities     Derivatives not designated as hedging instruments:     Foreign currency derivative contracts Accounts payable, accrued expenses and other liabilities $ 3,033  $ 14,025 ##TABLE_ENDThe effect of the derivative instruments not designated as hedging instruments on the consolidated statements of operations during fiscal 2017 , 2016 and 2015 , respectively, are summarized below (in thousands):  ##TABLE_START         Derivatives Not Designated as Hedging Instruments Gains (losses) on Derivative Instruments Recognized in Other income (expense)     Fiscal Year Ended January 31,  Location    Foreign currency derivative contracts Other expense  $ (86,239 )  $ (25,786 )  $ (1,186 ) ##TABLE_END4. Fair Value Measurement All of the Companys cash equivalents, marketable securities and foreign currency derivative contracts are classified within Level 1 or Level 2 because the Companys cash equivalents, marketable securities and foreign currency derivative contracts are valued using quoted market prices or alternative pricing sources and models utilizing observable market inputs. The Company uses a three-tier fair value hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used in the valuation methodologies in measuring fair value:  Level 1. Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. Level 2. Other inputs that are directly or indirectly observable in the marketplace. Level 3.

The unaudited pro forma financial information was as follows (in thousands): ##TABLE_START  Fiscal Year Ended January 31,   Total revenues $ 8,470,154  $ 6,813,535 Pretax loss (167,950 )  (362,882 ) Net loss (239,169 )  (212,342 ) ##TABLE_ENDThe pro forma financial information for all periods presented has been calculated after adjusting the results of Demandware and other acquisitions to reflect the business combination accounting effects resulting from these acquisitions including the amortization expense from acquired intangible assets and the stock-based compensation expense for unvested stock options and restricted stock awards assumed as though the acquisition occurred as of the beginning of the Companys fiscal year 2016. The historical financial information has been adjusted to give effect to pro forma events that are directly attributable to the business combinations and factually supportable. The pro forma financial information is for informational purposes only and is not indicative of the results of operations that would have been achieved if the acquisitions had taken place at the beginning of the Companys fiscal 2016. The pro forma financial information for fiscal 2017 and 2016 combines the historical results of the Company, the adjusted historical results of Demandware and other acquisitions for fiscal 2017 and 2016, due to differences in reporting periods and considering the date the Company acquired Demandware and other acquisitions, and the effects of the pro forma adjustments described above. 7.

Debt Convertible Senior Notes ##TABLE_START   Par Value Outstanding  Equity Component Recorded at Issuance  Liability Component of Par Value as of January 31, (in thousands)  0.25% Convertible Senior Notes due April 1, 2018 $ 1,150,000  $ 122,421 (1) $ 1,116,360  $ 1,088,097 ##TABLE_END___________ (1) This amount represents the equity component recorded at the initial issuance of the 0.25% convertible senior notes. In March 2013, the Company issued at par value $1.15 billion of 0.25% convertible senior notes (the  0.25% Senior Notes) due April 1, 2018 , unless earlier purchased by the Company or converted. Interest is payable semi-annually, in arrears on April 1 and October 1 of each year. The 0.25% Senior Notes are governed by an indenture between the Company, as issuer, and U.S. Bank National Association, as trustee. The 0.25% Senior Notes are unsecured and do not contain any financial covenants or any restrictions on the payment of dividends, the incurrence of senior debt or other indebtedness, or the issuance or repurchase of securities by the Company. If converted, holders of the 0.25% Senior Notes will receive cash equal to the principal amount, and at the Companys election, cash, shares of the Companys common stock, or a combination of cash and shares, for any amounts in excess of the principal amounts. Certain terms of the conversion features of the 0.25% Senior Notes are as follows: ##TABLE_START  Conversion Rate per $1,000 Par Value  Initial Conversion Price per Share  Convertible Date 0.25% Senior Notes 15.0512  $ 66.44  January 1, 2018 ##TABLE_ENDThroughout the term of the 0.25% Senior Notes, the conversion rate may be adjusted upon the occurrence of certain events, including any cash dividends. Holders of the 0.25% Senior Notes will not receive any cash payment representing accrued and unpaid interest upon conversion of a Note. Accrued but unpaid interest will be deemed to be paid in full upon conversion rather than canceled, extinguished or forfeited. Holders may convert the 0.25% Senior Notes under the following circumstances: ##TABLE_START  during any fiscal quarter, if, for at least 20 trading days during the 30 consecutive trading day period ending on the last trading day of the immediately preceding fiscal quarter, the last reported sales price of the Companys common stock for such trading day is greater than or equal to 130% of the applicable conversion price on such trading day share of common stock on such last trading day; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  in certain situations, when the trading price of the 0.25% Senior Notes is less than 98% of the product of the sale price of the Companys common stock and the conversion rate; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  upon the occurrence of specified corporate transactions described under the 0.25% Senior Notes indenture, such as a consolidation, merger or binding share exchange; or ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  at any time on or after the convertible date noted above (as described in the indenture). ##TABLE_END Holders of the 0.25% Senior Notes have the right to require the Company to purchase with cash all or a portion of the Notes upon the occurrence of a fundamental change, such as a change of control, at a purchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the 0.25% Senior Notes plus accrued and unpaid interest. Following certain corporate transactions that constitute a change of control, the Company will increase the conversion rate for a holder who elects to convert the 0.25% Senior Notes in connection with such change of control. In accounting for the issuances of the 0.25% Senior Notes, the Company separated the 0.25% Senior Notes into liability and equity components. The carrying amount of the liability component was calculated by measuring the fair value of a similar liability that does not have an associated convertible feature. The carrying amount of the equity component representing the conversion option was determined by deducting the fair value of the liability component from the par value of the 0.25% Senior Notes as a whole. The excess of the principal amount of the liability component over its carrying amount (debt discount) is amortized to interest expense over the term of the 0.25% Senior Notes. The equity component is not remeasured as long as it continues to meet the conditions for equity classification. In accounting for the transaction costs related to the 0.25% Senior Notes issuance, the Company allocated the total amount incurred to the liability and equity components based on its relative values. Transaction costs attributable to the liability component are being amortized to expense over the terms of the 0.25% Senior Notes, and transaction costs attributable to the equity component were netted with the equity component in stockholders equity. The 0.25% Senior Notes consisted of the following (in thousands):  ##TABLE_START  As of January 31,   Liability component :    Principal (1) $ 1,150,000  $ 1,150,000 Less: debt discount, net (2) (29,954 )  (54,941 ) Less: debt issuance cost (3) (3,686 )  (6,962 ) Net carrying amount $ 1,116,360  $ 1,088,097 ##TABLE_END(1) The effective interest rates of the 0.25% Senior Notes is 2.53% . These interest rates were based on the interest rates of a similar liability at the time of issuance that did not have an associated convertible feature. (2) Included in the consolidated balance sheets within Convertible 0.25% Senior Notes (which is classified as a noncurrent liability) and is amortized over the life of the 0.25% Senior Notes using the effective interest rate method. (3) In April 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-03 which simplifies the presentation of debt issuance costs by requiring debt issuance costs to be presented as a deduction from the corresponding debt liability rather than an asset that is amortized. The Company retrospectively adopted this standard for the prior period presented. The total estimated fair values of the Companys 0.25% Senior Notes at January 31, 2017 was $1.5 billion . The fair value was determined based on the closing trading price per $100 of the 0.25% Senior Notes as of the last day of trading for fiscal 2017 . Based on the closing price of the Companys common stock of $79.10 on January 31, 2017, the if-converted value of the 0.25% Senior Notes exceeded their principal amount by approximately $219.1 million . Based on the terms of the 0.25% Senior Notes, the Senior Notes were not convertible at any time during the fiscal year ended January 31, 2017 . Note Hedges To minimize the impact of potential economic dilution upon conversion of the Notes, the Company entered into convertible note hedge transactions with respect to its common stock (the Note Hedges).  ##TABLE_START (in thousands, except for shares) Date  Purchase  Shares 0.25% Note Hedges March 2013  $ 153,800  17,308,880 ##TABLE_ENDThe Note Hedges cover shares of the Companys common stock at a strike price that corresponds to the initial conversion price of the respective Notes, also subject to adjustment, and are exercisable upon conversion of the Notes. The Note Hedges will expire upon the maturity of the Notes. The Note Hedges are intended to reduce the potential economic dilution upon conversion of the Notes in the event that the market value per share of the Companys common stock, as measured under the Notes, at the time of exercise is greater than the conversion price of the Notes. The Note Hedges are separate transactions and are not part of the terms of the Notes. Holders of the Notes will not have any rights with respect to the Note Hedges. The Note Hedges do not impact earnings per share. Warrants ##TABLE_START  Date  Proceeds (in thousands)  Shares  Strike Price 0.25% Warrants March 2013  $ 84,800  17,308,880  $ 90.40 ##TABLE_ENDIn March 2013, the Company also entered into a warrants transaction (the  0.25% Warrants), whereby the Company sold warrants to acquire, subject to anti-dilution adjustments, shares of the Companys common stock. The 0.25% Warrants were anti-dilutive for the periods presented. The 0.25% Warrants are separate transactions entered into by the Company and are not part of the terms of the 0.25% Senior Notes or the 0.25% Note Hedges. Holders of the 0.25% Senior Notes and 0.25% Note Hedges will not have any rights with respect to the 0.25% Warrants. Term Loan In July 2016, the Company entered into a credit agreement (the Term Loan Credit Agreement) with Bank of America, N.A. and certain other institutional lenders for a $500.0 million term loan facility (the Term Loan) that matures on July 11, 2019. The Term Loan will bear interest, at the Companys option, at either a base rate plus a spread of 0.00% to 0.75% or an adjusted LIBOR rate plus a spread of 1.00% to 1.75% , in each case with such spread being determined based on the Companys consolidated leverage ratio for the preceding four fiscal quarter period. In July 2016, the Company borrowed the full $500.0 million under the Term Loan. All of the net proceeds of the Term Loan were for the purposes of partially funding the acquisition of Demandware. Interest on the Term Loan is due and payable in arrears quarterly for loans bearing interest at a rate based on the base rate and at the end of an interest period in the case of loans bearing interest at the adjusted LIBOR rate. All outstanding amounts under the Term Loan Credit Agreement will be due and payable on July 11, 2019. The Company may prepay the Term Loan, in whole or in part, at any time without premium or penalty, subject to certain conditions, and amounts repaid or prepaid may not be reborrowed. The Companys obligations under the Term Loan Credit Agreement are required to be guaranteed by certain of its subsidiaries meeting certain thresholds set forth in the Term Loan Credit Agreement. The Term Loan Credit Agreement contains customary affirmative and negative covenants, including covenants that limit or restrict the Company and its subsidiaries ability to, among other things, incur indebtedness, grant liens, merge or consolidate, dispose of assets, make investments, make acquisitions, enter into transactions with affiliates, pay dividends or make distributions and repurchase stock. The Company is also required to maintain compliance with a consolidated leverage ratio and a consolidated interest coverage ratio. The Term Loan Credit Agreement includes customary events of default. Under certain circumstances, a default interest rate will apply on all obligations during the existence of an event of default under the Term Loan Credit Agreement at a per annum rate equal to 2.00% above the applicable interest rate for any overdue principal and 2.00% above the rate applicable for base rate loans for any other overdue amounts. The occurrence of an event of default could result in the acceleration of obligations under the Term Loan Credit Agreement. The Company was in compliance with the Term Loan Credit Agreements covenants as of January 31, 2017 . The weighted average interest rate on the Term Loan was 1.8% for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2017 . Accrued interest on the Term Loan was $5.2 million as of January 31, 2017 . As of January 31, 2017 , the outstanding principal portion was $500.0 million , all of which was classified as noncurrent. Revolving Credit Facility In July 2016, the Company entered into an Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (the Revolving Loan Credit Agreement ) with Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, and certain other institutional lenders that provides for $1.0 billion unsecured revolving credit facility (the Credit Facility) that matures in July 2021. The Revolving Loan Credit Agreement amended and restated the Companys existing revolving credit facility dated October 2014. The Company may use the proceeds of future borrowings under the Credit Facility for refinancing other indebtedness, working capital, capital expenditures and other general corporate purposes, including permitted acquisitions. The borrowings under the Credit Facility bear interest, at the Companys option, at a base rate plus a spread of 0.00% to 0.75% or an adjusted LIBOR rate plus a spread of 1.00% to 1.75% , in each case with such spread being determined based on the Companys consolidated leverage ratio for the preceding four fiscal quarter period. Interest is due and payable in arrears quarterly for loans bearing interest at a rate based on the base rate and at the end of an interest period in the case of loans bearing interest at the adjusted LIBOR rate. Regardless of what amounts, if any, are outstanding under the Credit Facility, the Company is also obligated to pay an ongoing commitment fee at a rate of 0.125% to 0.25% , with such rate being based on the Companys consolidated leverage ratio for the preceding four fiscal quarter period, payable in arrears quarterly. The Revolving Loan Credit Agreement contains customary affirmative and negative covenants, including covenants that limit or restrict the Company and its subsidiaries ability to, among other things, incur indebtedness, grant liens, merge or consolidate, dispose of assets, make investments, make acquisitions, enter into transactions with affiliates, pay dividends or make distributions and repurchase stock. The Company is also required to maintain compliance with a consolidated leverage ratio and a consolidated interest coverage ratio. The Revolving Loan Credit Agreement includes customary events of default. Under certain circumstances, a default interest rate will apply on all obligations during the existence of an event of default under the Revolving Loan Credit Agreement at a per annum rate equal to 2.00% above the applicable interest rate for any overdue principal and 2.00% above the rate applicable for base rate loans for any other overdue amounts. The occurrence of an event of default could result in the acceleration of obligations under the Revolving Loan Credit Agreement. The Company was in compliance with the Revolving Loan Credit Agreements covenants as of January 31, 2017 . In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017, the Company drew upon $750.0 million of the Credit Facility and subsequently paid down $550.0 million of outstanding borrowings under the Credit Facility. There were $200.0 million outstanding borrowings under the Credit Facility as of January 31, 2017 . The weighted average interest rate on the borrowings under the Credit Facility was 1.9% for fiscal 2017. The Company continues to pay a fee on the undrawn amount of the Credit Facility. Loan Assumed on 50 Fremont The Company assumed a $200.0 million loan with the acquisition of 50 Fremont (the Loan). The Loan bears an interest rate of 3.75% per annum and is due in June 2023. The Loan initially requires interest only payments. Beginning in fiscal year 2019, principal and interest payments are required, with the remaining principal due at maturity. For the fiscal year 2017 and 2016, total interest expense recognized was $7.5 million and $7.3 million , respectively. The Loan can be prepaid at any time subject to a yield maintenance fee. The agreement governing the Loan contains certain customary affirmative and negative covenants that the Company was in compliance with as of January 31, 2017 .

Stockholders Equity The Company maintains the following stock plans: the ESPP, the 2013 Equity Incentive Plan and the 2014 Inducement Equity Incentive Plan (the 2014 Inducement Plan). The expiration of the 1999 Stock Option Plan (1999 Plan) in fiscal 2010 did not affect awards outstanding, which continue to be governed by the terms and conditions of the 1999 Plan. On July 10, 2014, the Company adopted the 2014 Inducement Plan with a reserve of 335,000 shares of common stock for future issuance solely for the granting of inducement stock options and equity awards to new employees, including employees of acquired companies. In addition, approximately 319,000 shares of common stock that remained available for grant under the 2006 Inducement Equity Incentive Plan (the Prior Inducement Plan) as of July 9, 2014 were added to the 2014 Inducement Plan share reserve and the Prior Inducement Plan was terminated. Further, any shares of common stock subject to outstanding awards under the Prior Inducement Plan that expire, are forfeited, or are repurchased by the Company will also become available for future grant under the 2014 Inducement Plan. Termination of the Prior Inducement Plan did not affect the outstanding awards previously issued thereunder. The 2014 Inducement Plan was adopted without stockholder approval in reliance on the employment inducement exemption provided under the New York Stock Exchange Listed Company Manual. In September 2011, the Companys Board of Directors amended and restated the ESPP. In conjunction with the amendment of the ESPP, the Companys Board of Directors determined that the offerings under the ESPP would commence, beginning with a twelve month offering period starting in December 2011. As of January 31, 2017 , $48.4 million has been withheld on behalf of employees for future purchases under the ESPP and is recorded in accounts payable, accrued expenses and other liabilities. Employees purchased 3.2 million shares for $126.1 million and 3.0 million shares for $155.0 million , in fiscal 2017 and 2016 , respectively, under the ESPP. Prior to February 1, 2006, options issued under the Companys stock option plans generally had a term of 10 years . From February 1, 2006 through July 3, 2013, options issued had a term of five years. After July 3, 2013, options issued have a term of seven years years. The fair value of each stock option grant was estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model with the following assumptions and fair value per share:  ##TABLE_START   Fiscal Year Ended January 31,   Stock Options        Volatility  31.4 -32.3 %  32-37 %  %  Estimated life  3.5 years   3.5 years   3.6 years   Risk-free interest rate  0.89-1.55% %  1.09-1.42 %  1.12-1.53 %  Weighted-average fair value per share of grants  $ 19.13   $ 20.22   $ 17.20   ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START              Fiscal Year Ended January 31,   ESPP        Volatility  28.2-35.2 %  30-34 %  32-35 %  Estimated life  0.75 years   0.75 years   0.75 years   Risk-free interest rate  0.47-0.98 %  0.06-0.76 %  0.07-0.23 %  Weighted-average fair value per share of grants  $ 20.18   $ 19.49   $ 14.56   ##TABLE_ENDThe Company estimated its future stock price volatility considering both its observed option-implied volatilities and its historical volatility calculations. Management believes this is the best estimate of the expected volatility over the expected life of its stock options and stock purchase rights. The estimated life for the stock options was based on an analysis of historical exercise activity. The estimated life of the ESPP was based on the two purchase periods within each offering period. The risk-free interest rate is based on the rate for a U.S. government security with the same estimated life at the time of the option grant and the stock purchase rights. The estimated forfeiture rate applied is based on historical forfeiture rates. The Company does not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future and therefore uses an expected dividend yield of zero in the option pricing model. During fiscal 2017 and 2016, the Company granted performance-based restricted stock unit awards to the Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer as well as to other executive officers subject to vesting based on a performance-based condition and a service-based condition. These performance-based restricted stock units will vest simultaneously if the performance condition is achieved.

The intrinsic value is the difference between the current market value of the stock and the exercise price of the stock option. The weighted-average remaining contractual life of vested and expected to vest options is approximately 5.2 years. As of January 31, 2017 , options to purchase 12,180,819 shares were vested at a weighted average exercise price of $49.82 per share and had a remaining weighted-average contractual life of approximately 4.1 years . The total intrinsic value of these vested options as of January 31, 2017 was $359.6 million . During fiscal 2017 , the Company recognized stock-based expense of $820.4 million . As of January 31, 2017 , the aggregate stock compensation remaining to be amortized to costs and expenses was $2.6 billion . It is expected that this stock compensation balance will be amortized as follows: $980.5 million during fiscal 2018 ; $762.9 million during fiscal 2019 ; $540.5 million during fiscal 2020 ; $249.7 million during fiscal 2021 ; $17.4 million during fiscal 2022 ; $17.2 million during fiscal 2023 ; $8.0 million during fiscal 2024 . The expected amortization reflects only outstanding stock awards as of January 31, 2017 and assumes no forfeiture activity.

The expense related to these awards, which was expensed immediately at the time of the issuance, totaled $4.7 million , $4.8 million and $5.0 million for fiscal 2017 , 2016 and 2015 , respectively. Preferred Stock The Companys board of directors has the authority, without further action by stockholders, to issue up to 5,000,000 shares of preferred stock in one or more series. The Companys board of directors may designate the rights, preferences, privileges and restrictions of the preferred stock, including dividend rights, conversion rights, voting rights, terms of redemption, liquidation preference, sinking fund terms, and number of shares constituting any series or the designation of any series. The issuance of preferred stock could have the effect of restricting dividends on the Companys common stock, diluting the voting power of its common stock, impairing the liquidation rights of its common stock, or delaying or preventing a change in control. The ability to issue preferred stock could delay or impede a change in control. As of January 31, 2017 and 2016 , no shares of preferred stock were outstanding. 11.

The excess tax benefits resulted from the vesting or the settlement of the stock awards recorded in the consolidated statement of operations during fiscal 2017 were immaterial, after considering the change in the Company's valuation allowance. Prior to the adoption of ASU 2016-09, the Company recorded the excess tax benefits of $59.5 million and $7.7 million directly to stockholders' equity, in fiscal 2016 and 2015 respectively. In fiscal 2017, the Company recorded a net tax benefit of $154.2 million . The most significant component of this tax amount was the benefit of $210.3 million resulting from a partial release of its valuation allowance in connection with the acquisition of Demandware. The net deferred tax liability from acquisitions provided an additional source of income to support the realizability of the Company's pre-existing deferred tax assets and as a result, the Company released a portion of its valuation allowance. The tax benefit associated with the release of the valuation allowance was partially offset by income taxes in profitable jurisdictions outside the United States. In addition, as a result of adopting ASU 2016-09 and the Company's valuation allowance position, it did not record significant current tax expense for the United States. In fiscal 2016, the Company recorded income taxes in profitable jurisdictions outside the United States and current tax expense in the United States. The Company had U.S. current tax expense as a result of taxable income before considering certain excess tax benefits from stock options and vesting of restricted stock. In fiscal 2015 , the Company recorded income taxes in profitable jurisdictions outside the United States, which was partially offset by tax benefits from losses incurred by ExactTarget in certain state jurisdictions. A reconciliation of income taxes at the statutory federal income tax rate to the provision for (benefit from) income taxes included in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations is as follows (in thousands): ##TABLE_START   Fiscal Year Ended January 31,     U.S. federal taxes at statutory rate  $ 8,884  $ 22,498  $ (74,580 ) State, net of the federal benefit   (5,260 )  (5,332 ) Foreign taxes in excess of the U.S. statutory rate (1)  61,912  (25,780 )  29,880 Change in valuation allowance  (128,797 )  139,565  100,143 Tax credits  (50,216 )  (48,943 )  (28,056 ) Non-deductible expenses  47,836  26,841  26,224 Tax expense from acquisitions   1,584  2,341 Excess tax benefits related to shared based compensation (2)  (95,030 )   Other, net  (244 )  1,200  (1,017 ) Provision for (benefit from) income taxes  $ (154,249 )  $ 111,705  $ 49,603 ##TABLE_END (1) In fiscal 2016, most of the Altera related tax benefits was reflected in the foreign taxes in excess of the U.S. statutory rate, which was partially offset by a change in valuation allowance. (2) In fiscal 2017, due to the early adoption of ASU 2016-09, the excess tax benefits resulted from the vesting or the settlement of the stock awards were recorded in the tax provision, which was offset by the valuation allowance in the U.S. jurisdiction. The Company received certain tax incentives in Switzerland and Singapore in the form of reduced tax rates. The tax reduction program in Switzerland expired in fiscal 2015, and the program in Singapore expired in fiscal 2016. Deferred Income Taxes Deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effect of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes. Significant components of the Companys deferred tax assets and liabilities were as follows (in thousands): ##TABLE_START   As of January 31,    Deferred tax assets:     Net operating loss carryforwards  $ 1,018,080  $ 260,015 Deferred stock-based expense  133,921  89,532 Tax credits  240,925  211,997 Deferred rent expense  65,779  49,790 Accrued liabilities  141,008  122,950 Deferred revenue   14,261 Basis difference on strategic and other investments  42,034  26,202 Financing obligation  140,539  127,198 Deferred cost sharing adjustment  30,351  30,351 Non-cash equity liability  26,155  Other  21,432  22,845 Total deferred tax assets  1,860,224  955,141 Less valuation allowance  (948,386 )  (439,971 ) Deferred tax assets, net of valuation allowance  911,838  515,170 Deferred tax liabilities:     Deferred commissions  (139,641 )  (121,071 ) Purchased intangibles  (408,203 )  (160,200 ) Unrealized gains on investments  (8,547 )  (2,858 ) Depreciation and amortization  (251,782 )  (224,435 ) Deferred revenue  (98,997 )  Other   (2,207 ) Total deferred tax liabilities  (907,170 )  (510,771 ) Net deferred tax assets  $ 4,668  $ 4,399 ##TABLE_ENDAt January 31, 2017 , for federal income tax purposes, the Company had net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $2.7 billion , which expire in fiscal 2021 through fiscal 2038, federal research and development tax credits of approximately $196.1 million , which expire in fiscal 2020 through fiscal 2037, foreign tax credits of approximately $42.8 million , which expire in fiscal 2019 through fiscal 2027, and minimum tax credits of $0.7 million , which have no expiration date. For California income tax purposes, the Company had net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $890.2 million which expire beginning in fiscal 2018 through fiscal 2038, California research and development tax credits of approximately $157.3 million , which do not expire, and $9.5 million of enterprise zone tax credits, which expire in fiscal 2025. For other states income tax purposes, the Company had net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $1.1 billion which expire beginning in fiscal 2018 through fiscal 2037 and tax credits of approximately $17.1 million , which expire beginning in fiscal 2021 through fiscal 2027. Utilization of the Companys net operating loss carryforwards may be subject to substantial annual limitation due to the ownership change limitations provided by the Internal Revenue Code and similar state provisions. Such an annual limitation could result in the expiration of the net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards before utilization. The Company regularly assesses the realizability of its deferred tax assets and establishes a valuation allowance if it is more-likely-than-not that some or all of its deferred tax assets will not be realized. The Company evaluates and weighs all available positive and negative evidence such as historic results, future reversals of existing deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income, as well as prudent and feasible tax-planning strategies. Generally, more weight is given to objectively verifiable evidence, such as the cumulative loss in recent years. During fiscal 2017, the valuation allowance increased by $508.4 million . The net increase was primarily a result of the early adoption of ASU 2016-09, which was offset by the partial release of the valuation allowance in connection with the acquisitions. The Company will continue to assess the realizability of the deferred tax assets in each of the applicable jurisdictions going forward. The Company will adjust its valuation allowance in the event sufficient positive evidence overcomes the negative evidence of losses in recent years, for example, if the trend in increasing taxable income continues. Tax Benefits Related to Stock-Based Expense The total income tax benefit related to stock-based awards was $228.8 million , $180.2 million and $170.8 million for fiscal 2017 , 2016 and 2015 , respectively, the majority of which was not recognized as a result of the valuation allowance. Unrecognized Tax Benefits and Other Considerations The Company records liabilities related to its uncertain tax positions. Tax positions for the Company and its subsidiaries are subject to income tax audits by multiple tax jurisdictions throughout the world. Certain prior year tax returns are currently being examined by various taxing authorities in countries including the United States and France. The Company recognizes the tax benefit of an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the position is sustainable upon examination by the taxing authority, based on the technical merits. The tax benefit recognized is measured as the largest amount of benefit which is greater than 50 percent likely to be realized upon settlement with the taxing authority. The Company had gross unrecognized tax benefits of $231.3 million , $172.7 million , and $146.2 million as of January 31, 2017 , 2016 and 2015 respectively. A reconciliation of the beginning and ending balance of total unrecognized tax benefits for fiscal years 2017 , 2016 and 2015 is as follows (in thousands): ##TABLE_START   Fiscal Year Ended January 31,     Balance as of February 1, 2016  $ 172,741  $ 146,188  $ 102,275 Tax positions taken in prior period:      Gross increases  18,254  7,456  17,938 Gross decreases  (1,131 )  (7,264 )  (1,967 ) Tax positions taken in current period:      Gross increases  57,872  38,978  34,226 Settlements  (15,598 )  (8,684 )  Lapse of statute of limitations  (1,261 )  (781 )  (1,224 ) Currency translation effect   (3,152 )  (5,060 ) Balance as of January 31, 2017  $ 231,317  $ 172,741  $ 146,188 ##TABLE_ENDFor fiscal 2017 , 2016 and 2015 total unrecognized tax benefits in an amount of $73.0 million , $56.2 million and $44.6 million , respectively, if recognized, would reduce income tax expense and the Companys effective tax rate after considering the impact of the change in valuation allowance in the U.S. The Company recognizes accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in the income tax provision. The Company accrued penalties and interest in the amount of $0.2 million , $1.3 million and $1.3 million in income tax expense during fiscal 2017 , 2016 and 2015 , respectively. The balance in the non-current income tax payable related to penalties and interest was $6.7 million , $6.3 million and $4.6 million as of January 31, 2017 , 2016 and 2015 , respectively. The Company has operations and taxable presence in multiple jurisdictions in the U.S. and outside of the U.S. Tax positions for the Company and its subsidiaries are subject to income tax audits by multiple tax jurisdictions around the world. The Company currently considers U.S. federal and state, Canada, Japan, Australia, Germany, France and the United Kingdom to be major tax jurisdictions. The Companys U.S. federal and state tax returns since February 1999, which was the inception of the Company, remain open to examination. With some exceptions, tax years prior to fiscal 2011 in jurisdictions outside of U.S. are generally closed. However, in Japan and United Kingdom, the Company is no longer subject to examinations for years prior to fiscal 2014 and fiscal 2015, respectively. The Company is currently under audit by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service for fiscal 2011 to 2012. Additionally, examinations are conducted in other international jurisdictions, including France. During fiscal 2017, the Company completed examinations or effectively settled on tax positions with various taxing authorities and accordingly, decreased unrecognized tax benefits by $15.6 million resulting from settlements. The Company regularly evaluates its uncertain tax positions and the likelihood of outcomes from these tax examinations. Significant judgment and estimates are necessary in the determination of income tax reserves. The Company believes that it has provided adequate reserves for its income tax uncertainties. However, the outcome of the tax audits cannot be predicted with certainty. If any issues addressed in the Company's tax audits are resolved in a manner inconsistent with management's expectations, the Company could adjust its provision for income taxes in the future. However, in general, any adjustments resulting from the U.S. audits should not have an impact to the Company's tax provision due to its valuation allowance. In the next twelve months, as some of these ongoing examinations are completed and tax positions in these tax years meet the conditions of being effectively settled, the Company anticipates it is reasonably possible that a decrease of unrecognized tax benefits up to approximately $12.0 million may occur. 12. Earnings/Loss Per Share Basic earnings/loss per share is computed by dividing net income (loss) by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding for the fiscal period. Diluted earnings/loss per share is computed by giving effect to all potential weighted average dilutive common stock, including options, restricted stock units, warrants and the convertible senior notes. The dilutive effect of outstanding awards and convertible securities is reflected in diluted earnings per share by application of the treasury stock method. Diluted loss per share for fiscal 2016 and 2015 are the same as basic loss per share as there is a net loss in these periods and inclusion of potentially issuable shares is anti-dilutive. A reconciliation of the denominator used in the calculation of basic and diluted loss per share is as follows (in thousands):  ##TABLE_START   Fiscal Year Ended January 31,     Numerator:       Net income (loss)  $ 179,632  $ (47,426 )  $ (262,688 ) Denominator:       Weighted-average shares outstanding for basic earnings (loss) per share  687,797  661,647  624,148 Effect of dilutive securities:       Convertible senior notes  1,906   Employee stock awards  10,514   Adjusted weighted-average shares outstanding and assumed conversions for diluted earnings (loss) per share  700,217  661,647  624,148 ##TABLE_ENDThe weighted-average number of shares outstanding used in the computation of basic and diluted earnings/loss per share does not include the effect of the following potential outstanding common stock.

Commitments Letters of Credit As of January 31, 2017 , the Company had a total of $83.3 million in letters of credit outstanding substantially in favor of certain landlords for office space. These letters of credit renew annually and expire at various dates through December 2030. Leases The Company leases facilities space and certain fixed assets under non-cancelable operating and capital leases with various expiration dates. As of January 31, 2017 , the future minimum lease payments under non-cancelable operating and capital leases are as follows (in thousands):  ##TABLE_START  Capital Leases  Operating Leases  Financing Obligation -Leased Facility(1) Fiscal Period:      Fiscal 2018 $ 119,342  $ 463,250  $ 21,437 Fiscal 2019 115,791  413,435  21,881 Fiscal 2020 201,578  332,127  22,325 Fiscal 2021  266,253  22,770 Fiscal 2022  241,266  23,214 Thereafter  1,202,817  210,713 Total minimum lease payments 436,747  $ 2,919,148  $ 322,340 Less: amount representing interest (39,531 )   Present value of capital lease obligations $ 397,216   ##TABLE_END______________ (1) Total Financing Obligation -Leased Facility noted above represents the total obligation on the lease agreement noted in Note 5 Property and Equipment. As of January 31, 2017, $220.3 million of the total $322.3 million obligation noted above was recorded to Financing obligation - leased facility, of which the current portion is included in \"Accounts payable, accrued expenses and other liabilities\" and the non-current portion is included in Other noncurrent liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets. The Companys agreements for the facilities and certain services provide the Company with the option to renew. The Companys future contractual obligations would change if the Company exercised these options. The terms of the lease agreements provide for rental payments on a graduated basis. The Company recognizes rent expense on a straight-line basis over the lease period and has accrued for rent expense incurred but not paid. Of the total operating lease commitment balance of $2.9 billion , approximately $2.5 billion is related to facilities space. The remaining commitment amount is related to computer equipment and furniture and fixtures. Rent expense for fiscal 2017 , 2016 and 2015 was $226.0 million , $174.6 million and $162.8 million , respectively. Other Purchase Commitments In April 2016, the Company entered into an agreement with a third party provider for certain infrastructure services for a period of four years . The agreement provides that the Company will pay $96.0 million in fiscal 2018, $108.0 million in fiscal 2019 and $126.0 million in fiscal 2020. 14. Employee Benefit Plan The Company has a 401(k) plan covering all eligible employees in the United States and a Registered Retirement Savings plan covering all eligible employees in Canada. Since January 1, 2006, the Company has been contributing to the plans. Total Company contributions during fiscal 2017 , 2016 and 2015 , were $56.4 million , $45.6 million and $38.1 million , respectively. 15. Legal Proceedings and Claims In the ordinary course of business, the Company is or may be involved in various legal proceedings and claims related to alleged infringement of third-party patents and other intellectual property rights, commercial, corporate and securities, labor and employment, class actions, wage and hour, and other claims. The Company has been, and may in the future be, put on notice and/or sued by third parties for alleged infringement of their proprietary rights, including patent infringement. In general, the resolution of a legal matter could prevent the Company from offering its service to others, could be material to the Companys financial condition or cash flows, or both, or could otherwise adversely affect the Companys operating results. The Company makes a provision for a liability relating to legal matters when it is both probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. These provisions are reviewed at least quarterly and adjusted to reflect the impacts of negotiations, estimated settlements, legal rulings, advice of legal counsel and other information and events pertaining to a particular matter. In managements opinion, resolution of all current matters is not expected to have a material adverse impact on the Companys consolidated results of operations, cash flows or financial position. However, depending on the nature and timing of any such dispute, an unfavorable resolution of a matter could materially affect the Companys current or future results of operations or cash flows in a particular quarter. 16. Related-Party Transactions In January 1999, the Salesforce.com Foundation, also referred to as the Foundation, was chartered on an idea of leveraging the Companys people, technology, and resources to help improve communities around the world. The Company calls this integrated philanthropic approach the 1-1-1 model. Beginning in 2008, Salesforce.org, which is a non-profit public benefit corporation, was established to resell the Company's services to nonprofit organizations and certain higher education organizations. The Companys Chairman is the chairman of both the Foundation and Salesforce.org. The Companys Chairman holds one of the three Foundation board seats. The Companys Chairman, one of the Companys employees and one of the Companys board members hold three of Salesforce.orgs nine board seats. The Company does not control the Foundations or Salesforce.org's activities, and accordingly, the Company does not consolidate either of the related entities' statement of activities with its financial results. Since the Foundations and Salesforce.orgs inception, the Company has provided at no charge certain resources to those entities' employees such as office space, furniture, equipment, facilities, services, and other resources. The value of these items was approximately $3.3 million for the fiscal year 2017. The resource sharing agreement was amended in August 2015 to include resources outside of the United States and is more explicit about the types of resources that the Company will provide. Additionally, the Company has donated subscriptions of the Companys services to other qualified non-profit organizations. The Company also allows Salesforce.org to resell the Companys service to non-profit organizations and certain higher education entities. The Company does not charge Salesforce.org for these subscriptions, therefore revenue from subscriptions provided to non-profit organizations is donated back to the community through charitable grants made by the Foundation and Salesforce.org. For instance, the reseller agreement was amended in August 2015 to include additional customer segments and certain customers outside the U.S. and was amended in October 2015 to add an addendum with model clauses for the processing of personal data transferred from the European Economic Area. The value of the subscriptions pursuant to reseller agreements, as amended, was approximately $112.4 million for the fiscal year 2017. The Company plans to continue these programs. As described in Note 6 Business Combinations, the Company's Chairman held an ownership interest in an acquisition that was completed by the Company in April 2016. 17. Subsequent Events In February 2017, the Company paid down the remaining $200.0 million of outstanding borrowings under the Credit Facility. As of the filing date, there were no outstanding borrowings under the Credit Facility. In February 2017, the Company acquired the outstanding stock of Sequence, Inc. (Sequence), a consulting firm that helps lead design-driven transformation by creating connected customer experiences. The Company acquired Sequence for its employees and product offerings. Beginning with the fiscal quarter ended April 30, 2017, the Company will include the financial results of Sequence in its condensed consolidated financial statements from the date of the acquisition. The total estimated consideration for Sequence was approximately $18.0 million . 18.

CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES ##TABLE_END (a) Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act), as of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K. In designing and evaluating our disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any disclosure controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. In addition, the design of disclosure controls and procedures must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and that management is required to apply its judgment in evaluating the benefits of possible controls and procedures relative to their costs. Based on managements evaluation, our chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are designed to, and are effective to, provide assurance at a reasonable level that the information we are required to disclose in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in Securities and Exchange Commission rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. (b) Managements Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f). Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of January 31, 2017 based on the guidelines established in the Internal ControlIntegrated Framework (2013 framework) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). Our internal control over financial reporting includes policies and procedures that provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external reporting purposes in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. In accordance with guidance issued by the Securities and Exchange Commission, companies are permitted to exclude acquisitions from their final assessment of internal control over financial reporting for the first fiscal year in which the acquisition occurred. Our managements evaluation of internal control over financial reporting excluded the internal control activities of Demandware, Inc. (Demandware), which we acquired in July 2016, as discussed in Note 6, Business Combinations, of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. We have included the financial results of Demandware in the consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisition. Total revenues subject to Demandwares internal control over financial reporting represented approximately one percent of our consolidated total revenues for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2017. Total assets subject to Demandware's internal control over financial reporting represented approximately two percent of our consolidated total asset, excluding acquisition method fair value adjustments, as of January 31, 2017 . Total net assets subject to Demandware's internal control over financial reporting represented approximately two percent of our consolidated net assets, excluding acquisition method fair value adjustments, as of January 31, 2017 . Based on the results of our evaluation, our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of January 31, 2017 . We reviewed the results of managements assessment with our Audit Committee. The effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of January 31, 2017 has been audited by Ernst  Young LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in its report which is included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. (c) Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting There was no change in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended January 31, 2017 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. (d) Inherent Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls Our management, including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, do not expect that our disclosure controls or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the Company have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty, and that breakdowns can occur because of a simple error or mistake. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people or by management override of the controls. The design of any system of controls is also based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions; over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or the degree of compliance with policies or procedures may deteriorate. Because of the inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected. ##TABLE_START ", "9B": " ITEM 9B.

BUSINESS Overview Salesforce is a global leader in customer relationship management, or CRM, software. We deliver our cloud-based software through the internet as a service. We introduced our first CRM solution in 2000, and have since expanded our service offerings into new areas and industries, as well as introduced new features and platform capabilities. Our core mission is to empower our customers to connect with their customers in entirely new ways through cloud, mobile, social, Internet of Things (IoT) and artificial intelligence (AI) technologies. Our service offerings are designed to be intuitive and easy to use. They can be deployed rapidly via mobile devices and major internet browsers, configured easily and integrated with other platforms and enterprise applications. We sell to businesses of all sizes and in almost every industry worldwide on a subscription basis, primarily through our direct sales efforts and also indirectly through partners. Through our platform and other developer tools, we also enable third parties to develop additional functionality and new applications, or apps, that run on our platform, which are sold separately from, or in conjunction with, our service offerings. We deliver a comprehensive portfolio of service offerings including sales force automation, customer service and support, marketing automation, digital commerce, community management, collaboration, industry-specific solutions and the Salesforce Platform, also referred to as the Customer Success Platform, which includes Trailhead, Einstein AI, Lightning, IoT, Heroku, Analytics and the AppExchange. Salesforce operates with a set of core values: trust, growth, innovation and equality. At Salesforce, we believe nothing is more important than the trust of our customers. Customers trust our technology to deliver the highest levels of security, reliability and availability at scale. Our continuous innovation and the democratization of both technology and innovation drives customer success, which in turn drives mutual growth. Salesforce also believes in giving back. We pioneered, and have inspired other companies to adopt, an integrated philanthropy model called the 1-1-1 model, which leverages 1% of a company's equity, employee time and product to help improve communities around the world. In addition, we have spearheaded initiatives to create a world where equal pay, equal advancement, equal opportunity and equal rights become a reality for our employees and the broader world. W e also strive to play a meaningful role in creating a sustainable, low-carbon future by delivering a carbon neutral cloud, operating as a net-zero greenhouse gas emissions company and by working to achieve our goal of 100 percent renewable energy for our global operations. We were incorporated in Delaware in February 1999, and our principal executive offices are located in San Francisco, California. Our principal website address is www.salesforce.com and our office address is The Landmark @ One Market, Suite 300, San Francisco, California 94105.

In addition, Service Cloud also offers a field service solution that enables companies to connect agents, dispatchers and mobile employees through one centralized platform, on which they can schedule and dispatch work intelligently, and track and manage jobs in real-time. Marketing Cloud. The Marketing Cloud enables companies to plan, personalize and optimize one-to-one customer marketing journeys, including interactions across email, mobile, social, web and connected products. In addition, companies can segment and target audiences to power precise digital marketing at scale.

Built mobile-first, Quip breaks down communication barriers and silos to enable every business to collaborate online, offline and from any device. Industry Offerings. To meet the needs of our customers in certain industries, we also provide solutions for Financial Services, Healthcare and Government. Financial Services Cloud enables retail banking and wealth management institutions to bring together disparate lines of business, geographies and channels to put customers at the center of every interaction. For example, Health Cloud is a patient and member relationship platform that harnesses our cloud, social and mobile technologies to deliver more personalized engagement by providing a complete view of the patient, intelligent care collaboration and a connected patient engagement experience. Government Cloud provides departments and agencies with a group of connected cloud services and solutions enabling any agency to build modern, connected app experiences that empower them to work faster, smarter and the way they want. Salesforce Platform. The Salesforce Platform includes tools customers can leverage to build intelligent and connected enterprise apps. Thousands of partner-built apps and millions of custom apps built by customers have been developed on the Salesforce Platform. The Salesforce Platform also offers a full continuum of AI, no-code, low-code and code development and integration services, including Trailhead, Einstein AI, Lightning, IoT, Heroku, Analytics and the AppExchange. ##TABLE_START  Trailhead is our free, gamified, interactive online learning platform, where anyone can become a Trailblazer by learning in-demand skills, including administering our services and developing on the Salesforce Platform. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Einstein AI  is a set  of advanced AI capabilities embedded across the entire Salesforce Platform that  automatically discovers relevant insights, predicts future behavior, proactively recommends best next actions and automates tasks. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Salesforce Lightning  is a component-based experience, platform and ecosystem that allows customers to create apps fast with clicks, not code.  ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  IoT is a platform service that allows businesses to use IoT data at scale with tools to create rules-based automation to deliver proactive sales, service and marketing. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Heroku is an app development Platform-as-a-Service for building mobile and web customer apps. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Analytics delivers complete, intelligent analytics so customers can explore their business data, uncover new insights, make smarter decisions and take action from any device. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  AppExchange is an enterprise cloud marketplace that allows customers to extend the Salesforce Platform to every department and every industry with more than 5,000 solutions, 5,000,000 customer installs and 70,000 peer reviews. ##TABLE_END Success Cloud. We offer professional services to help customers achieve business results faster with Salesforce solutions. Our architects and innovation program teams act as advisors to plan and execute digital transformations for our customers. We provide best-practices based support and adoption programs globally. In addition, we provide more advanced education, including instructor-led and online courses to certify our customers and partners on architecting, administering, deploying and developing our service offerings. Business Benefits of Using Our Solution The key advantages of our solution include, but are not limited to the following: Secure, private, scalable and reliable. Our services have been designed to provide our customers with high levels of performance, reliability and security. We have built, and continue to invest in, a comprehensive security infrastructure, including firewalls, intrusion detection systems and encryption for transmission over the Internet, which we monitor, test and update on an ongoing basis. We built and maintain a multi-tenant application architecture that has been designed to enable our services to scale securely, reliably and cost effectively considering, among other things, the Framework for Improving Critical Infrastructure Cybersecurity issued by the National Institute of Standards and Technology, which assembles standards, guidelines and practices. Our multi-tenant application architecture maintains the integrity and separation of customer data while still permitting all customers to use the same application functionality simultaneously. Our cloud services have received an extensive set of third-party data protection compliance certifications and attestations across geographical regions and industries, demonstrating our unwavering commitment to customer trust. Rapid deployment and lower total cost of ownership. Our services can be deployed rapidly since our customers do not have to spend time procuring, installing or maintaining the servers, storage, networking equipment, security products or other hardware and software. We enable customers to achieve up-front savings relative to the traditional enterprise software model. Customers benefit from the predictability of their future costs since they generally pay for the service on a per subscriber basis for the term of the subscription contract. We further reduce the total cost of ownership of our cloud services over the subscription term by delivering multiple releases per year which automatically introduce new features and functionality, while preserving previous customizations and integrations that minimize additional customer engineering investment for compatibility. Ease of integration and configuration. Our customers and partners are able to integrate and configure our solutions with existing applications quickly and seamlessly. We provide a set of application programming interfaces (APIs) that enable customers and independent software developers to both integrate our solutions with existing third-party, custom and legacy apps and write their own application services that integrate with our solutions. For example, many of our customers use our Salesforce Platform API to move customer-related data from custom-developed and packaged applications into our services on a periodic basis to provide greater visibility into their activities. Administrators, developers and business users can also take advantage of our custom-branded tool sets with point-and-click ease to develop reusable components to tailor and extend the CRM experience with AI, IoT data and content. Ease of use. We have designed our solutions to be intuitive and easy to use. Our solutions contain many modern and recognizable tools and features that are similar to popular consumer websites, which provide a more familiar user experience than traditional enterprise software. As a result, our users can often use and gain benefit from our solutions with minimal training. Rapid development of apps. Our customers and third-party developers can create apps rapidly because of the ease of use and the benefits of a multi-tenant platform. We provide the capability for business users to configure our applications to suit their specific needs and also support a variety of programming languages so developers can code complex apps spanning multiple business processes. By providing infrastructure and development environments on demand, we provide developers the opportunity to create new and innovative apps without having to invest in hardware. Developers can create, test and support their apps on the Salesforce Platform and make their apps accessible for a subscription fee to customers. With millions of installations of third-party developed apps, the AppExchange demonstrates the growing Salesforce ecosystem. Continuous innovation. We release hundreds of new features to all of our customers multiple times a year. Our metadata-driven, multi-tenant cloud enables every customer to run their business on the latest release without disruption. We readily embrace the ideas and opinions of our Trailblazer community, comprised of customers, innovators, technology disruptors and global shapers, through our Ideas Exchange, which is a forum to provide feedback and suggest new features for future service releases. Because we deploy all upgrades on our servers, new features and functionality automatically become part of our service on the upgrade release date, benefiting all of our customers immediately. Positive environmental impact. Our multi-tenant cloud computing model has a much smaller environmental footprint than traditional Information Technology (\"IT\") hardware and software. When organizations move business applications to Salesforce, they can significantly reduce their energy use and carbon footprint compared to traditional on-premises solutions. Our Growth Strategy We invest for future growth by focusing on the following key priorities: Cross selling and upselling. We see significant opportunity to deepen our relationships with our existing customers. As our customers realize the benefits of our services, we aim to upgrade the customer experience with premium editions and additional subscriptions by targeting new functional areas and business units, ultimately becoming our customers' trusted advisors, inspiring enterprise-wide digital transformation and accelerating strategic engagements through direct discussions with the highest levels of our customers' executive management. Extending existing service offerings. We offer multiple editions of our service offerings at different price points to meet the needs of customers of different sizes and we have designed our solutions to accommodate new features and functionality. We intend to continue to extend all editions of our service offerings with new features, functions and increased security through our own development, acquisitions and partnerships. Over the past year, for example, we have invested heavily in the AI capabilities of Einstein, which allows users of our products to deliver more predictive customer experiences, as well as innovations like Lightning and Trailhead that elevate the entire platform. Reducing customer attrition. Our goal is to have all of our customers renew their subscriptions prior to the end of their contractual terms. We run customer success and other related programs in an effort to secure renewals of existing customers. Expanding and strengthening the partner ecosystem. We continue to work with strategic system integrators (SIs) and independent software vendors (ISVs) to reach new markets and industries, offer a variety of solutions and apps through the AppExchange, and address the business requirements of both current and future customers. International expansion. We continue to increase our investment in our international go-to-market resources, operations and infrastructure to deliver the highest quality service to our customers around the world. Targeting vertical industries. To meet the needs of our customers in certain industries, we also provide solutions specifically built for certain vertical industries, such as financial services, healthcare and public sector. Expanding into new horizontal markets. As part of our growth strategy, which is driven both organically and through acquisitions, we are delivering innovative solutions in new categories, including analytics, commerce and IoT. Extending go-to-market capabilities. We believe that our offerings provide significant value for businesses of any size. We will continue to pursue businesses of all sizes in top industries and major regions globally, primarily through our direct sales force. We have steadily increased and plan to continue to increase the number of direct sales professionals we employ, and we intend to develop additional distribution channels for our solutions around the globe. Ensuring strong customer adoption. We believe that we have the people, processes and proven innovation to help companies transform successfully. We have free, curated resources such as Trailhead to help companies of every size get up to speed, as well as advisory services, technical architects and business strategists to enable and accelerate digital transformation. Encouraging the development of third-party applications on our cloud computing platform. The Salesforce Platform enables customers, ISVs and third-party developers to create and deliver cloud-based apps. It is a platform on which apps can be created, tested, published and run. In addition, these apps can be marketed and sold on the AppExchange or sold directly by software vendors. We believe our ecosystem of developers and software vendors will address the business requirements of both current and future customers. In addition to the key elements of our business strategy described above, from time to time, we evaluate opportunities to acquire or invest in complementary businesses, services, technologies and intellectual property rights. This evaluation resulted in our acquisition of several companies in the past few years. Technology, Development and Operations We deliver our Salesforce solutions as highly scalable, cloud computing application and platform services on a multi-tenant technology architecture. Multi-tenancy is an architectural approach that allows us to operate a single application instance for multiple organizations, treating all customers as separate tenants who run in virtual isolation from each other. This approach allows us to spread the cost of delivering our services across our user base and scale our business faster than traditional software vendors while focusing our resources on building new functionality. We provide the majority of our services to our customers from infrastructure designed and operated by us but secured within third-party data center facilities located in the United States, United Kingdom, Germany, France, Japan and other countries. These third-party data center operators provide space, physical security, continuous power and cooling. In combination with these third-party data center facilities, we also provide our services via cloud computing platform partners who offer Infrastructure as a Service, including servers, storage, databases and networking. The use of cloud computing platform partners provides us flexibility to service customers in new and emerging regions and those with in-country data privacy requirements, as well as to support acquired companies. Our technology and product efforts are focused on improving and enhancing the features, functionality, performance, availability and security of our existing service offerings as well as developing new features, functionality and services. Performance, functional depth, security and the usability of our solutions influence our technology decisions and product direction. Sources of Revenue For revenue reporting purposes, we group all of our service offerings into four major categories: Sales Cloud, Service Cloud, Salesforce Platform and Other, and Marketing and Commerce Cloud. Our subscription and support revenues are disaggregated into these four core offerings. For a more detailed discussion, see the Revenue by Cloud Service Offering discussion in Managements Discussion and Analysis. We derive our revenues primarily from subscription and support fees for our services. We also derive revenues from related professional services via the Success Cloud. We recognize subscription and support revenue ratably over the contract term, beginning on the commencement date of each contract. We enter into professional services contracts that are on a time and materials, fixed fee or subscription basis. We recognize revenue as the services are rendered for time and materials contracts, when the milestones are achieved and accepted by the customer or on a proportional performance basis for fixed price contracts or ratably over the contract term for subscription professional services. Amounts that have been invoiced are recorded in accounts receivable and in deferred revenue or revenue, depending on whether the revenue recognition criteria have been met. Deferred revenue primarily consists of billings or payments received in advance of revenue recognition from subscription services described above and is recognized as the revenue recognition criteria are met. Unbilled deferred revenue represents future billings under our subscription agreements that have not been invoiced and, accordingly, are not recorded in deferred revenue. We generally invoice customers in annual installments. Deferred revenue and unbilled deferred revenue are influenced by several factors, including new business seasonality within the year, the specific timing, size and duration of large customer subscription agreements, the timing and compounding effects of customer renewals, varying billing cycles of subscription agreements, invoice timing, foreign currency fluctuations and new business linearity. Our fourth quarter has historically been our strongest quarter for new business and renewals, and our first quarter is generally our largest collections and operating cash flow quarter. For a more detailed discussion, see the Seasonal Nature of Deferred Revenue, Accounts Receivable and Operating Cash Flow discussion in Managements Discussion and Analysis. Customers We sell to businesses of all sizes and in almost every industry worldwide. The number of paying subscriptions at each of our customers ranges from one to hundreds of thousands. None of our customers accounted for more than five percent of our revenues in fiscal 2018, 2017 or 2016. Customer Service and Support Our global customer support group responds to both business and technical inquiries about the use of our products via the web, telephone, email, social networks and other channels. We provide standard customer support during regular business hours at no charge to customers who purchase any of our paying subscription editions. We also offer premier customer support that is either included in a premium offering or sold for an additional fee, which can include services such as priority access to technical resources, developer support, and system administration. In addition, we offer a mission critical support add-on that is designed to provide customers with responses for incidents from a dedicated team knowledgeable about the customer's specific enterprise architecture, and which offers instruction to optimize their usage of our products. Sales and Marketing We sell our services primarily through our direct sales force, which is comprised of telephone sales personnel based in regional hubs, and field sales personnel based in territories close to their customers. Both our telephone sales and field sales personnel are supported by sales representatives, who are primarily responsible for generating qualified sales leads. We have a network of partners who refer sales leads to us and who then assist in selling to these prospects. This network includes global consulting firms, systems integrators and other partners. In return, we typically pay these partners a fee based on the first-year subscription revenue generated by the customers whom they refer. We continue to invest in developing additional distribution channels for our subscription service. Our marketing strategy is to promote our brand and generate demand for our offerings. We use a variety of marketing programs across traditional and social channels to target our prospective and current customers, partners and developers. We focus our marketing activities on the cities and countries with the largest market opportunity. Our primary marketing activities include: ##TABLE_START  Multi-channel marketing campaigns that span email, social, web and more, which align to a broader customer journey; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Customer events of all sizes to create customer and prospect awareness, including proprietary events such as Dreamforce and World Tours, as well as participation in trade shows and industry events; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Press and industry analyst relations to garner third-party validation and generate positive coverage for our company, offerings and value proposition; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Content marketing and engagement on all of the major social channels; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Search engine marketing and advertising to drive traffic to our web properties; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Partner co-marketing activities with global and regional implementation partners; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Web site development to engage and educate prospects and generate interest through product information and demonstrations, case studies, white papers and marketing collateral; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Customer testimonials; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Cultivating a community of Trailblazers who embrace our Company values and evangelize our offerings; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Tools that enable our sales organization to more effectively convert leads into customers; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Event sponsorships; and ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Primary real estate signage. ##TABLE_END We organize our sales and marketing programs by geographic regions, such as the Americas, Europe and Asia Pacific, which includes Japan. The majority of our revenue from the Americas is attributable to customers in the United States. Approximately 28 percent of our revenue for fiscal 2018 comes from customers outside of the Americas. Competition The market for our service offerings is highly competitive, rapidly evolving and fragmented, and subject to changing technology, shifting customer needs and frequent introductions of new products and services. Our current competitors include: ##TABLE_START  Vendors of packaged business software, as well as companies offering enterprise apps delivered through on-premises offerings from enterprise software application vendors and cloud computing application service providers, either individually or with others; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Software companies that provide their product or service free of charge, and only charge a premium for advanced features and functionality; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Internally developed enterprise applications (by our potential customers IT departments); ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Marketing vendors, which may be specialized in advertising, targeting, messaging, or campaign automation; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  E-commerce solutions from emerging cloud-only vendors and established on-premises vendors; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Traditional platform development environment companies and cloud computing development platform companies who may develop toolsets and products that allow customers to build new apps that run on the customers current infrastructure or as hosted services; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  IoT platforms from large companies that have existing relationships with hardware and software companies; and ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  AI solutions from new startups and established companies. ##TABLE_ENDWe believe that as traditional enterprise software application and platform vendors shift more of their focus to cloud computing, they may become a greater competitive threat. Strategic Investments Since 2009, we have been investing in early- to late-stage technology and professional cloud service companies across the globe to support our key business initiatives, which include, among other things, extending the capabilities of our platform and service offerings, increasing the ecosystem of enterprise cloud companies and partners, accelerating the adoption of cloud technologies and creating the next-generation of mobile applications and connected products. Our minority investments in over 200 companies as of January 31, 2018 also help us stay connected with the rapid pace of innovation that is currently occurring within the technology industry. In some cases, we have acquired companies in which we have previously invested. Due to the inherent risk in investing, our individual investments are subject to a risk of partial or total loss of investment capital. Intellectual Property We rely on a combination of trademarks, copyrights, trade secrets and patents, as well as contractual provisions, to protect our proprietary technology and our brands. We also enter into confidentiality and proprietary rights agreements with our employees, consultants and other third parties and control access to software, services, documentation and other proprietary information. We believe the duration of our patents is adequate relative to the expected lives of our service offerings. We also purchase or license technology that we incorporate into our products or services. At times, we make select intellectual property broadly available at no or low cost to achieve a strategic objective, such as promoting industry standards, advancing interoperability, fostering open source software or attracting and enabling our external development community. While it may be necessary in the future to seek or renew licenses relating to various aspects of our products and business methods, we believe, based upon past experience and industry practice, such licenses generally could be obtained on commercially reasonable terms. We believe our continuing research and product development are not materially dependent on any single license or other agreement with a third party relating to the development of our products. Employees As of January 31, 2018, we had more than 29,000 employees. None of our employees in the United States are represented by a labor union, however, for certain foreign subsidiaries, works councils represent our employees.

RISK FACTORS ##TABLE_END The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones facing us. Other events that we do not currently anticipate or that we currently deem immaterial also may affect our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. Risks Related to Our Business and Industry If our security measures or those of our third-party data center hosting facilities, cloud computing platform providers, or third-party service partners, are breached, and unauthorized access is obtained to a customers data, our data or our IT systems, or authorized access is blocked or disabled, our services may be perceived as not being secure, customers may curtail or stop using our services, and we may incur significant legal and financial exposure and liabilities. Our services involve the storage and transmission of our customers and our customers' customers' proprietary and other sensitive data, including financial information and other personally identifiable information. While we have security measures in place, they may be breached as a result of efforts by individuals or groups of hackers and sophisticated organizations, including state-sponsored organizations or nation-states. Our security measures could also be compromised by employee error or malfeasance, which could result in someone obtaining unauthorized access to, or denying authorized access to our IT systems, our customers data or our data, including our intellectual property and other confidential business information. Additionally, third parties may attempt to fraudulently induce employees or customers into disclosing sensitive information such as user names, passwords or other information to gain access to our customers data, our data or our IT systems. Because the techniques used to breach, obtain unauthorized access to, or sabotage IT systems change frequently, grow more complex over time, and generally are not recognized until launched against a target, we may be unable to anticipate or implement adequate measures to prevent against such techniques. Our services operate in conjunction with and are dependent on products and components across a broad ecosystem and, as illustrated by the recent Spectre and Meltdown threats, if there is a security vulnerability in one of these components, a security breach could occur. In addition, our internal IT systems continue to evolve and we are often early adapters of new technologies and new ways of sharing data and communicating internally and with partners and customers, which increases the complexity of our IT systems. These risks are mitigated by our ability to maintain and improve business and data governance policies and processes and internal security controls, including our ability to escalate and respond to known and potential risks. In addition, our customers may authorize third-party technology providers to access their customer data, and some of our customers may not have adequate security measures in place to protect their data that is stored on our servers. Because we do not control our customers or third-party technology providers, or the processing of such data by third-party technology providers, we cannot ensure the integrity or security of such transmissions or processing. Malicious third parties may also conduct attacks designed to temporarily deny customers access to our services. A security breach could expose us to a risk of loss or inappropriate use of proprietary and sensitive data, or the denial of access to this data. A security breach could also result in a loss of confidence in the security of our services, damage our reputation, negatively impact our future sales, disrupt our business and lead to legal liability. Finally, the detection, prevention and remediation of known or potential security vulnerabilities, including those arising from third-party hardware or software may result in additional direct and indirect costs, for example additional infrastructure capacity to mitigate any system degradation that could result from remediation efforts. Defects or disruptions in our services could diminish demand for our services and subject us to substantial liability. Because our services are complex and incorporate a variety of hardware, proprietary software and third-party software, our services may have errors or defects that could result in unanticipated downtime for our subscribers and harm to our reputation and our business. Cloud services frequently contain undetected errors when first introduced or when new versions or enhancements are released. We have from time to time found defects in, and experienced disruptions to, our services and new defects or disruptions may occur in the future. In addition, our customers may use our services in unanticipated ways that may cause a disruption in services for other customers attempting to access their data. As we acquire companies, we may encounter difficulty in incorporating the acquired technologies into our services and in augmenting the technologies to meet the quality standards that are consistent with our brand and reputation. Since our customers use our services for important aspects of their business, any errors, defects, disruptions in service or other performance problems could hurt our reputation and may damage our customers businesses. As a result, customers could elect to not renew our services or delay or withhold payment to us. We could also lose future sales or customers may make warranty or other claims against us, which could result in an increase in our allowance for doubtful accounts, an increase in collection cycles for accounts receivable or the expense and risk of litigation. Any interruptions or delays in services from third-parties, including data center hosting facilities, cloud computing platform providers and other hardware and software vendors, or from our inability to adequately plan for and manage service interruptions or infrastructure capacity requirements, could impair the delivery of our services and harm our business. We currently serve our customers from third-party data center hosting facilities and cloud computing platform providers located in the United States and other countries. We also rely on computer hardware purchased or leased from, software licensed from, and cloud computing platforms provided by, third parties in order to offer our services, including database software, hardware and data from a variety of vendors. Any damage to, or failure of our systems generally, including the systems of our third-party platform providers, could result in interruptions in our services. We have from time to time experienced interruptions in our services and such interruptions may occur in the future. Interruptions in our services may cause us to issue credits or pay penalties, cause customers to make warranty or other claims against us or to terminate their subscriptions and adversely affect our attrition rates and our ability to attract new customers, all of which would reduce our revenue. Our business would also be harmed if our customers and potential customers believe our services are unreliable. We use a range of disaster recovery and business continuity arrangements. For many of our offerings, our production environment and customers data are replicated in near real-time in a separate facility located elsewhere. Certain offerings, including some offerings of companies added through acquisitions, may be served through alternate facilities or arrangements. We do not control the operation of any of these facilities, and they may be vulnerable to damage or interruption from earthquakes, floods, fires, power loss, telecommunications failures and similar events. They may also be subject to break-ins, sabotage, intentional acts of vandalism and similar misconduct, as well as local administrative actions, changes to legal or permitting requirements and litigation to stop, limit or delay operation. Despite precautions taken at these facilities, such as disaster recovery and business continuity arrangements, the occurrence of a natural disaster or an act of terrorism, a decision to close the facilities without adequate notice or other unanticipated problems at these facilities could result in lengthy interruptions in our services. These hardware, software, data and cloud computing platforms may not continue to be available at reasonable prices, on commercially reasonable terms or at all. Any loss of the right to use any of these hardware, software or cloud computing platforms could significantly increase our expenses and otherwise result in delays in the provisioning of our services until equivalent technology is either developed by us, or, if available, is identified, obtained through purchase or license and integrated into our services. If we do not accurately plan for our infrastructure capacity requirements and we experience significant strains on our data center capacity, our customers could experience performance degradation or service outages that may subject us to financial liabilities, result in customer losses and harm our business. When we add data centers and add capacity, we may move or transfer our data and our customers data. Despite precautions taken during this process, any unsuccessful data transfers may impair the delivery of our services, which may damage our business. Privacy concerns and laws such as the European Unions General Data Protection Regulation, evolving regulation of cloud computing, cross-border data transfer restrictions and other domestic or foreign regulations may limit the use and adoption of our services and adversely affect our business. Regulation related to the provision of services over the Internet is evolving, as federal, state and foreign governments continue to adopt new, or modify existing, laws and regulations addressing data privacy and the collection, processing, storage, transfer and use of data. In some cases, new data privacy laws and regulations, such as the European Unions (\"EU\") General Data Protection Regulation that takes effect in May 2018 and an amended Act on the Protection of Personal Information in Japan, impose new obligations directly on Salesforce as both a data controller and a data processor, as well as on many of our customers. These new laws may require us to make changes to our services to enable Salesforce and/or our customers to meet the new legal requirements, and may also increase our potential liability exposure through higher potential penalties for non-compliance. Further, laws such as the European Unions proposed e-Privacy Regulation are increasingly aimed at the use of personal information for marketing purposes, and the tracking of individuals online activities. These new or proposed laws and regulations are subject to differing interpretations and may be inconsistent among jurisdictions. These and other requirements could reduce demand for our services, require us to take on more onerous obligations in our contracts, restrict our ability to store, transfer and process data or, in some cases, impact our ability to offer our services in certain locations or our customers' ability to deploy our solutions globally. For example, ongoing legal challenges in Europe to the mechanisms allowing companies to transfer personal data from the European Economic Area to the United States could result in further limitations on the ability to transfer data across borders, particularly if governments are unable or unwilling to reach new or maintain existing agreements that support cross-border data transfers, such as the EU-U.S. and Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield framework. Additionally, certain countries have passed or are considering passing laws requiring local data residency. The costs of compliance with, and other burdens imposed by, privacy laws, regulations and standards may limit the use and adoption of our services, reduce overall demand for our services, make it more difficult to meet expectations from or commitments to customers, lead to significant fines, penalties or liabilities for noncompliance, or slow the pace at which we close sales transactions, any of which could harm our business. In addition to government activity, privacy advocacy and other industry groups have established or may establish new self-regulatory standards that may place additional burdens on our ability to provide our services globally. Our customers expect us to meet voluntary certification and other standards established by third parties, such as TRUSTe. If we are unable to maintain these certifications or meet these standards, it could adversely affect our ability to provide our solutions to certain customers and could harm our business. Furthermore, concerns regarding data privacy may cause our customers customers to resist providing the data necessary to allow our customers to use our services effectively. Even the perception that the privacy of personal information is not satisfactorily protected or does not meet regulatory requirements could inhibit sales of our products or services and could limit adoption of our cloud-based solutions. Our efforts to expand our services beyond the CRM market and to develop and integrate our existing services in order to keep pace with technological developments may not succeed and may reduce our revenue growth rate and harm our business. We derive a significant portion of our revenue from subscriptions to our CRM enterprise cloud computing application services, and we expect this will continue for the foreseeable future. Our efforts to expand our services beyond the CRM market may not succeed and may reduce our revenue growth rate. The markets for certain of our offerings remain relatively new and it is uncertain whether our efforts, and related investments, will ever result in significant revenue for us. Further, the introduction of significant platform changes and upgrades, including our conversion to our new Lightning platform, and introduction of new services beyond the CRM market, may not be successful, and early stage interest and adoption of such new services may not result in long term success or significant revenue for us. Additionally, if we fail to anticipate or identify significant Internet-related and other technology trends and developments early enough, or if we do not devote appropriate resources to adapting to such trends and developments, our business could be harmed. If we are unable to develop enhancements to and new features for our existing or new services that keep pace with rapid technological developments, our business could be harmed. The success of enhancements, new features and services depends on several factors, including the timely completion, introduction and market acceptance of the feature, service or enhancement by customers, administrators and developers, as well as our ability to seamlessly integrate all of our service offerings. Failure in this regard may significantly impair our revenue growth as well as negatively impact our operating results if the additional costs are not offset by additional revenues. In addition, because our services are designed to operate over various network technologies and on a variety of mobile devices, operating systems and computer hardware and software platforms using a standard browser, we will need to continuously modify and enhance our services to keep pace with changes in Internet-related hardware, software, communication, browser, app development platform and database technologies. We may not be successful in either developing these modifications and enhancements or in bringing them to market timely. Furthermore, uncertainties about the timing and nature of new network platforms or technologies, or modifications to existing platforms or technologies, could increase our research and development or service delivery expenses. Any failure of our services to operate effectively with future network platforms and technologies could reduce the demand for our services, result in customer dissatisfaction and harm our business. As we acquire and invest in companies or technologies, we may not realize the expected business or financial benefits and the acquisitions could prove difficult to integrate, disrupt our business, dilute stockholder value and adversely affect our operating results and the market value of our common stock. As part of our business strategy, we periodically make investments in, or acquisitions of, complementary businesses, joint ventures, services and technologies and intellectual property rights, and we expect that we will continue to make such investments and acquisitions in the future. Acquisitions and investments involve numerous risks, including:  potential failure to achieve the expected benefits of the combination or acquisition;  difficulties in, and the cost of, integrating operations, technologies, services, platforms and personnel;  diversion of financial and managerial resources from existing operations; ##TABLE_START  the potential entry into new markets in which we have little or no experience or where competitors may have stronger market positions; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  potential write-offs of acquired assets or investments, and potential financial and credit risks associated with acquired customers; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  potential loss of key employees of the acquired company; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  inability to generate sufficient revenue to offset acquisition or investment costs; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  inability to maintain relationships with customers and partners of the acquired business; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  difficulty of transitioning the acquired technology onto our existing platforms and customer acceptance of multiple platforms on a temporary or permanent basis; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  augmenting the acquired technologies and platforms to the levels that are consistent with our brand and reputation; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  increasing or maintaining the security standards for acquired technology consistent with our other services; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  potential unknown liabilities associated with the acquired businesses; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  unanticipated expenses related to acquired technology and its integration into our existing technology; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  negative impact to our results of operations because of the depreciation and amortization of amounts related to acquired intangible assets, fixed assets and deferred compensation; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  additional stock based compensation; the loss of acquired deferred revenue and unbilled deferred revenue; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  delays in customer purchases due to uncertainty related to any acquisition; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  ineffective or inadequate controls, procedures and policies at the acquired company may negatively impact our results of operations; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  challenges caused by integrating operations over distance, and across different languages and cultures; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  currency and regulatory risks associated with foreign countries and potential additional cybersecurity and compliance risks resulting from entry into new markets; and ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  the tax effects of any such acquisitions. ##TABLE_END Any of these risks could harm our business. In addition, to facilitate these acquisitions or investments, we may seek additional equity or debt financing, which may not be available on terms favorable to us or at all, which may affect our ability to complete subsequent acquisitions or investments, and which may affect the risks of owning our common stock. For example, if we finance acquisitions by issuing equity or convertible or other debt securities or loans, our existing stockholders may be diluted, or we could face constraints related to the terms of, and repayment obligation related to, the incurrence of indebtedness that could affect the market price of our common stock. Industry-specific regulation and other requirements and standards are evolving and unfavorable industry-specific laws, regulations, interpretive positions or standards could harm our business. Our customers and potential customers conduct business in a variety of industries, including financial services, the public sector, healthcare and telecommunications. Regulators in certain industries have adopted and may in the future adopt regulations or interpretive positions regarding the use of cloud computing and other outsourced services. The costs of compliance with, and other burdens imposed by, industry-specific laws, regulations and interpretive positions may limit our customers use and adoption of our services and reduce overall demand for our services. Compliance with these regulations may also require us to devote greater resources to support certain customers, which may increase costs and lengthen sales cycles. For example, some financial services regulators have imposed guidelines for use of cloud computing services that mandate specific controls or require financial services enterprises to obtain regulatory approval prior to outsourcing certain functions. If we are unable to comply with these guidelines or controls, or if our customers are unable to obtain regulatory approval to use our services where required, our business may be harmed. In addition, an inability to satisfy the standards of certain voluntary third-party certification bodies that our customers may expect, such as an attestation of compliance with the Payment Card Industry (PCI) Data Security Standards, may have an adverse impact on our business and results. If in the future we are unable to achieve or maintain industry-specific certifications or other requirements or standards relevant to our customers, it may harm our business and adversely affect our results. Further, in some cases, industry-specific laws, regulations or interpretive positions may also apply directly to us as a service provider. The interpretation of many of these statutes, regulations, and rulings is evolving in the courts and administrative agencies and an inability to comply may have an adverse impact on our business and results. Any failure or perceived failure by us to comply with such requirements could have an adverse impact on our business. For example, there are various statutes, regulations, and rulings relevant to the direct email marketing and text-messaging industries, including the Telephone Consumer Protection Act (TCPA) and related Federal Communication Commission (FCC) orders, which impose significant restrictions on the ability to utilize telephone calls and text messages to mobile telephone numbers as a means of communication, when the prior consent of the person being contacted has not been obtained. We are, and may in the future be, subject to one or more class-action lawsuits, as well as individual lawsuits, containing allegations that one of our businesses or customers violated the TCPA. A determination that we or our customers violated the TCPA or other communications-based statutes could expose us to significant damage awards that could, individually or in the aggregate, materially harm our business. Supporting our existing and growing customer base could strain our personnel resources and infrastructure, and if we are unable to scale our operations and increase productivity, we may not be able to successfully implement our business plan. We continue to experience significant growth in our customer base and personnel, which has placed a strain on our management, administrative, operational and financial infrastructure. We anticipate that additional investments in our internal infrastructure, data center capacity, research, customer support and development, and real estate spending will be required to scale our operations and increase productivity, to address the needs of our customers, to further develop and enhance our services, to expand into new geographic areas, and to scale with our overall growth. The additional investments we are making will increase our cost base, which will make it more difficult for us to offset any future revenue shortfalls by reducing expenses in the short term. We regularly upgrade or replace our various software systems. If the implementations of these new applications are delayed, or if we encounter unforeseen problems with our new systems or in migrating away from our existing applications and systems, our operations and our ability to manage our business could be negatively impacted. Our success will depend in part upon the ability of our senior management to manage our projected growth effectively. To do so, we must continue to increase the productivity of our existing employees and to hire, train and manage new employees as needed. To manage the expected domestic and international growth of our operations and personnel, we will need to continue to improve our operational, financial and management controls, our reporting systems and procedures, and our utilization of real estate. If we fail to successfully scale our operations and increase productivity, we may be unable to execute our business plan and the fair value of our common stock could decline. The market in which we participate is intensely competitive, and if we do not compete effectively, our operating results could be harmed. The market for enterprise applications and platform services is highly competitive, rapidly evolving and fragmented, and subject to changing technology, shifting customer needs and frequent introductions of new products and services. Many prospective customers have invested substantial personnel and financial resources to implement and integrate their current enterprise software into their businesses and therefore may be reluctant or unwilling to migrate away from their current solution to an enterprise cloud computing application service. Additionally, third-party developers may be reluctant to build application services on our platform since they have invested in other competing technology platforms. Our current competitors include: ##TABLE_START  Vendors of packaged business software, as well as companies offering enterprise apps delivered through on-premises offerings from enterprise software application vendors and cloud computing application service providers, either individually or with others; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Software companies that provide their product or service free of charge, and only charge a premium for advanced features and functionality; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Internally developed enterprise applications (by our potential customers IT departments); ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Marketing vendors, which may be specialized in advertising, targeting, messaging, or campaign automation; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  E-commerce solutions from emerging cloud-only vendors and established on-premises vendors; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Traditional platform development environment companies and cloud computing development platform companies who may develop toolsets and products that allow customers to build new apps that run on the customers current infrastructure or as hosted services; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  IoT platforms from large companies that have existing relationships with hardware and software companies; and ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Artificial intelligence solutions from new startups and established companies. ##TABLE_END Some of our current and potential competitors may have competitive advantages, such as greater name recognition, longer operating histories, significant installed bases, broader geographic scope, and larger marketing budgets, as well as substantially greater financial, technical, and other resources. In addition, many of our current and potential competitors have established marketing relationships and access to larger customer bases, and have major distribution agreements with consultants, system integrators and resellers. We also experience competition from smaller, younger competitors that may be more agile in responding to customers' demands. As a result, our competitors may be able to respond more quickly and effectively than we can to new or changing opportunities, technologies, standards or customer requirements. Furthermore, because of these advantages, even if our services are more effective than the products and services that our competitors offer, potential customers might select competitive products and services in lieu of purchasing our services. For all of these reasons, we may not be able to compete successfully against our current and future competitors, which could negatively impact our future sales and harm our business. Our ability to deliver our services is dependent on the development and maintenance of the infrastructure of the Internet by third parties. The Internets infrastructure is comprised of many different networks and services that are highly fragmented and distributed by design. This infrastructure is run by a series of independent third-party organizations that work together to provide the infrastructure and supporting services of the Internet under the governance of the Internet Corporation for Assigned Numbers and Names (ICANN) and the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA), now under the stewardship of ICANN. The Internet has experienced a variety of outages and other delays as a result of damages to portions of its infrastructure, denial-of-service attacks or related cyber incidents, and it could face outages and delays in the future. These outages and delays could reduce the level of Internet usage or result in fragmentation of the Internet, resulting in multiple separate Internets. These scenarios are not under our control and could reduce the availability of the Internet to us or our customers for delivery of our Internet-based services. Any resulting interruptions in our services or the ability of our customers to access our services could result in a loss of potential or existing customers and harm our business. In addition, certain countries have implemented (or may implement) legislative and technological actions that either do or can effectively regulate access to the Internet, including the ability of Internet Service Providers to limit access to specific websites or content. These actions could potentially limit or interrupt access to our services from certain countries or Internet Service Providers, impede our growth, result in the loss of potential or existing customers and harm our business. We are subject to risks associated with our strategic investments. Other-than-temporary impairments in the value of our investments could negatively impact our financial results. We invest in early-to-late stage companies for strategic reasons and to support key business initiatives, and may not realize a return on our strategic investments. Many such companies generate net losses and the market for their products, services or technologies may be slow to develop, and, therefore, are dependent on the availability of later rounds of financing from banks or investors on favorable terms to continue their operations. The financial success of our investment in any company is typically dependent on a liquidity event, such as a public offering, acquisition or other favorable market event reflecting appreciation to the cost of our initial investment. The capital markets for public offerings and acquisitions are dynamic and the likelihood of liquidity events for the companies we have invested in could significantly worsen. Further, valuations of privately-held companies are inherently complex due to the lack of readily available market data. If we determine that any of our investments in such companies have experienced a decline in value, we may be required to record an other-than-temporary impairment, which could be material. We have in the past written off the full value of specific investments. Similar situations could occur in the future and negatively impact our financial results and may harm our business and cause our stock price to decline. All of our investments are subject to a risk of a partial or total loss of investment capital. Our quarterly results are likely to fluctuate, which may cause the value of our common stock to decline substantially. Our quarterly results are likely to fluctuate. For example, our fiscal fourth quarter has historically been our strongest quarter for new business and renewals. The year-over-year compounding effect of this seasonality in billing patterns and overall new business and renewal activity causes the value of invoices that we generate in the fourth quarter to continually increase in proportion to our billings in the other three quarters of our fiscal year. As a result, our fiscal first quarter is our largest collections and operating cash flow quarter. Additionally, some of the important factors that may cause our revenues, operating results and cash flows to fluctuate from quarter to quarter include: ##TABLE_START  our ability to retain and increase sales to existing customers, attract new customers and satisfy our customers requirements; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  the attrition rates for our services; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  the rate of expansion and productivity of our sales force; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  the length of the sales cycle for our services; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  new product and service introductions by our competitors; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  our success in selling our services to large enterprises; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  our ability to realize benefits from strategic partnerships, acquisitions or investments; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  general economic conditions, which may adversely affect either our customers ability or willingness to purchase additional subscriptions or upgrade their services, or delay a prospective customer's purchasing decision, reduce the value of new subscription contracts, or affect attrition rates; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  variations in the revenue mix of our services and growth rates of our cloud subscription and support offerings; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  changes in our pricing policies and terms of contracts, whether initiated by us or as a result of competition; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  changes in payment terms and the timing of customer payments and payment defaults by customers; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  changes in deferred revenue and unbilled deferred revenue balances, which are not reflected in the balance sheet, due to seasonality, the compounding effects of renewals, invoice duration, size and timing, new business linearity between quarters and within a quarter and fluctuations due to foreign currency movements, all of which may impact implied growth rates; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  the seasonality of our customers businesses, especially Commerce Cloud customers, including retailers and branded manufacturers; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  changes in foreign currency exchange rates such as with respect to the British Pound; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  the amount and timing of operating costs and capital expenditures related to the operations and expansion of our business; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  the number of new employees; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  the timing of commission, bonus, and other compensation payments to employees; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  the cost, timing and management effort for the introduction of new features to our services; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  the costs associated with acquiring new businesses and technologies and the follow-on costs of integration and consolidating the results of acquired businesses; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  expenses related to our real estate, our office leases and our data center capacity and expansion; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  timing of additional investments in our enterprise cloud computing application and platform services and in our consulting services; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  expenses related to significant, unusual or discrete events, which are recorded in the period in which the events occur; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  extraordinary expenses such as litigation or other dispute-related settlement payments; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  income tax effects, including the impact of changes in U.S. federal and state and international tax laws applicable to corporate multinationals; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  the timing of payroll and other withholding tax expenses, which are triggered by the payment of bonuses and when employees exercise their vested stock awards; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  technical difficulties or interruptions in our services; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  changes in interest rates and our mix of investments, which would impact the return on our investments in cash and marketable securities; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  conditions, particularly sudden changes, in the financial markets, which have impacted and may continue to impact the value of and liquidity of our investment portfolio; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  changes in the fair value of our strategic investments in early-to-late stage public and privately held companies, which could be material in a particular quarter; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  equity issuances, including as consideration in acquisitions or due to the conversion of our outstanding convertible notes at the election of the note holders; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  the timing of stock awards to employees and the related adverse financial statement impact of having to expense those stock awards on a straight-line basis over their vesting schedules; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  evolving regulations of cloud computing and cross-border data transfer restrictions and similar regulations; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  regulatory compliance costs; and ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  the impact of new accounting pronouncements and associated system implementations, for example, the adoption of Accounting Standards Update No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) (ASU 2014-09), which includes the accounting for revenue recognized and capitalized costs. ##TABLE_END Many of these factors are outside of our control, and the occurrence of one or more of them might cause our operating results to vary widely. If we fail to meet or exceed operating results expectations or if securities analysts and investors have estimates and forecasts of our future performance that are unrealistic or that we do not meet, the market price of our common stock could decline. In addition, if one or more of the securities analysts who cover us adversely change their recommendation regarding our stock, the market price of our common stock could decline. If we experience significant fluctuations in our rate of anticipated growth and fail to balance our expenses with our revenue forecasts, our business could be harmed and the market price of our common stock could decline. Due to the pace of change and innovation in enterprise cloud computing services, the unpredictability of future general economic and financial market conditions, the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, the growing complexity of our business, including the use of multiple pricing and packaging models, and our increasing focus on enterprise cloud computing services, we may not be able to realize our projected revenue growth plans. We plan our expense levels and investment on estimates of future revenue and future anticipated rate of growth. We may not be able to adjust our spending appropriately if the addition of new subscriptions or the renewals of existing subscriptions fall short of our expectations. A portion of our expenses may also be fixed in nature for some minimum amount of time, such as with deferred commissions, data center contracts or office leases, so it may not be possible to reduce costs in a timely manner, or at all, without the payment of fees to exit certain obligations early. As a result, we expect that our revenues, operating results and cash flows may fluctuate significantly on a quarterly basis and revenue growth rates may not be sustainable and may decline in the future, and we may not be able to provide continued operating margin expansion, which could harm our business and cause the market price of our common stock to decline. Sales to customers outside the United States expose us to risks inherent in international operations. We sell our services throughout the world and are subject to risks and challenges associated with international business. We intend to continue to expand our international sales efforts. The risks and challenges associated with sales to customers outside the United States or those that can affect international operations generally, include: ##TABLE_START  localization of our services, including translation into foreign languages and associated expenses; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  regulatory frameworks or business practices favoring local competitors; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  pressure on the creditworthiness of sovereign nations, particularly in Europe, where we have customers and a balance of our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  evolving domestic and international tax environments; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  liquidity issues or political actions by sovereign nations, which could result in decreased values of these balances or potential difficulties protecting our foreign assets or satisfying local obligations; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  foreign currency fluctuations and controls, which may make our services more expensive for international customers and could add volatility to our operating results; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  compliance with multiple, conflicting, ambiguous or evolving governmental laws and regulations, including employment, tax, privacy, anti-corruption, import/export, antitrust, data transfer, storage and protection, and industry-specific laws and regulations, including rules related to compliance by our third-party resellers; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  regional data privacy laws and other regulatory requirements that apply to outsourced service providers and to the transmission of our customers data across international borders; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  treatment of revenue from international sources and changes to tax codes, including being subject to foreign tax laws and being liable for paying withholding income or other taxes in foreign jurisdictions; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  different pricing environments; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  different or lesser protection of our intellectual property; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  longer accounts receivable payment cycles and other collection difficulties; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  natural disasters, acts of war, terrorism, pandemics or security breaches; and ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  regional economic and political conditions. ##TABLE_END Any of these factors could negatively impact our business and results of operations. The above factors may also negatively impact our ability to successfully expand into emerging market countries, where we have little or no operating experience, where it can be costly and challenging to establish and maintain operations, including hiring and managing required personnel, and difficult to promote our brand, and where we may not benefit from any first-to-market advantage or otherwise succeed. Because we recognize revenue from subscriptions for our services over the term of the subscription, downturns or upturns in new business may not be immediately reflected in our operating results. We generally recognize revenue from customers ratably over the terms of their subscription agreements, which are typically 12 to 36 months. As a result, most of the revenue we report in each quarter is the result of subscription agreements entered into during previous quarters. Consequently, a decline in new or renewed subscriptions in any one quarter may not be reflected in our revenue results for that quarter. Any such decline, however, will negatively impact our revenue in future quarters. Accordingly, the effect of significant downturns in sales and market acceptance of our services, and potential changes in our attrition rate, may not be fully reflected in our results of operations until future periods. Our subscription model also makes it difficult for us to rapidly increase our revenue through additional sales in any period, as revenue from new customers must be recognized over the applicable subscription term. If our customers do not renew their subscriptions for our services or reduce the number of paying subscriptions at the time of renewal, our revenue could decline and our business may suffer. If we cannot accurately predict subscription renewals or upgrade rates, we may not meet our revenue targets, which may adversely affect the market price of our common stock. Our customers have no obligation to renew their subscriptions for our services after the expiration of their contractual subscription period, which is typically 12 to 36 months, and in the normal course of business, some customers have elected not to renew. In addition, our customers may renew for fewer subscriptions, renew for shorter contract lengths, or switch to lower cost offerings of our services. It is difficult to predict attrition rates given our varied customer base of enterprise and small and medium size business customers and the number of multi-year subscription contracts. Our attrition rates may increase or fluctuate as a result of a number of factors, including customer dissatisfaction with our services, customers spending levels, mix of customer base, decreases in the number of users at our customers, competition, pricing increases or changes and deteriorating general economic conditions. Our future success also depends in part on our ability to sell additional features and services, more subscriptions or enhanced editions of our services to our current customers. This may also require increasingly sophisticated and costly sales efforts that are targeted at senior management. Similarly, the rate at which our customers purchase new or enhanced services depends on a number of factors, including general economic conditions and that our customers do not react negatively to any price changes related to these additional features and services. If customers do not renew their subscriptions, do not purchase additional features or enhanced subscriptions or if attrition rates increase, our business could be harmed. If third-party developers and providers do not continue to embrace our technology delivery model and enterprise cloud computing services, or if our customers seek warranties from us for third-party applications, integrations, data and content, our business could be harmed. Our success depends on the willingness of a growing community of third-party developers and technology providers to build applications and provide integrations, data and content that are complementary to our services. Without the continued development of these applications and provision of such integrations, data and content, both current and potential customers may not find our services sufficiently attractive, which could impact future sales. In addition, for those customers who authorize a third-party technology partner access to their data, we do not provide any warranty related to the functionality, security and integrity of the data transmission or processing. Despite contract provisions to protect us, customers may look to us to support and provide warranties for the third-party applications, integrations, data and content, even though not developed or sold by us, which may expose us to potential claims, liabilities and obligations, all of which could harm our business. We are exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates that could negatively impact our financial results and cash flows from changes in the value of the U.S. Dollar versus local currencies and the Euro versus the Pound Sterling. We conduct our business in the following regions: the Americas, Europe, and Asia Pacific. The expanding global scope of our business exposes us to risk of fluctuations in foreign currency markets. This exposure is the result of selling in multiple currencies, growth in our international investments, including data center expansion, additional headcount in foreign locations, and operating in countries where the functional currency is the local currency. Specifically, our results of operations and cash flows are subject to fluctuations primarily in British Pound Sterling, Euro, Japanese Yen, Canadian Dollar and Australian Dollar against the U.S. Dollar as well as the Euro against the Pound Sterling. These exposures may change over time as business practices evolve, economic conditions change and evolving tax regulations come into effect. The fluctuations of currencies in which we conduct business can both increase and decrease our overall revenue and expenses for any given fiscal period. Additionally, global political events, including the United Kingdoms 2016 vote in favor of exiting the European Union, or Brexit, and similar geopolitical developments, have caused global economic uncertainty, which could amplify the volatility of currency fluctuations. Such volatility, even when it increases our revenues or decreases our expenses, impacts our ability to accurately predict our future results and earnings. Although we attempt to mitigate some of this volatility and related risks through foreign currency hedging, our hedging activities are limited and may not effectively offset the adverse financial impacts that may result from unfavorable movements in foreign currency exchange rates, which could adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations. As more of our sales efforts are targeted at larger enterprise customers, our sales cycle may become more time-consuming and expensive, we may encounter pricing pressure and implementation and configuration challenges, and we may have to delay revenue recognition for some complex transactions, all of which could harm our business and operating results. As we target more of our sales efforts at larger enterprise customers, including governmental entities, we may face greater costs, longer sales cycles, greater competition and less predictability in completing some of our sales. In this market segment, the customers decision to use our services may be an enterprise-wide decision and, if so, these types of sales would require us to provide greater levels of education regarding the use and benefits of our services, as well as education regarding privacy and data protection laws and regulations to prospective customers with international operations. In addition, larger customers and governmental entities may demand more configuration, integration services and features. As a result of these factors, these sales opportunities may require us to devote greater sales support and professional services resources to individual customers, driving up costs and time required to complete sales and diverting our own sales and professional services resources to a smaller number of larger transactions, while potentially requiring us to delay revenue recognition on some of these transactions until the technical or implementation requirements have been met. Pricing and packaging strategies for enterprise and other customers for subscriptions to our existing and future service offerings may not be widely accepted by other new or existing customers. Our adoption of such new pricing and packaging strategies may harm our business. For large enterprise customers, professional services may also be performed by a third party or a combination of our own staff and a third-party. Our strategy is to work with third parties to increase the breadth of capability and depth of capacity for delivery of these services to our customers. If a customer is not satisfied with the quality of work performed by us or a third-party or with the type of services or solutions delivered, then we could incur additional costs to address the situation, the profitability of that work might be impaired, and the customers dissatisfaction with our services could damage our ability to obtain additional work from that customer. In addition, negative publicity related to our customer relationships, regardless of its accuracy, may further damage our business by affecting our ability to compete for new business with current and prospective customers. We have been and may in the future be sued by third parties for various claims including alleged infringement of proprietary rights. We are involved in various legal matters arising from the normal course of business activities. These may include claims, suits, government investigations and other proceedings involving alleged infringement of third-party patents and other intellectual property rights, commercial, corporate and securities, labor and employment, class actions, wage and hour, and other matters. The software and Internet industries are characterized by the existence of a large number of patents, trademarks and copyrights and by frequent litigation based on allegations of infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights. We have received in the past and may receive in the future communications from third parties, including practicing entities and non-practicing entities, claiming that we have infringed their intellectual property rights. In addition, we have been, and may in the future be, sued by third parties for alleged infringement of their claimed proprietary rights. Our technologies may be subject to injunction if they are found to infringe the rights of a third-party or we may be required to pay damages, or both. Further, many of our subscription agreements require us to indemnify our customers for third-party intellectual property infringement claims, which would increase the cost to us of an adverse ruling on such a claim. Our exposure to risks associated with various claims, including the use of intellectual property, may be increased as a result of acquisitions of other companies. For example, we may have a lower level of visibility into the development process with respect to intellectual property or the care taken to safeguard against infringement risks with respect to the acquired company or technology. In addition, third parties may make infringement and similar or related claims after we have acquired technology that had not been asserted prior to our acquisition. The outcome of any claims or litigation, regardless of the merits, is inherently uncertain. Any claims and lawsuits, and the disposition of such claims and lawsuits, whether through settlement or licensing discussions, or litigation, could be time-consuming and expensive to resolve, divert management attention from executing our business plan, result in efforts to enjoin our activities, lead to attempts on the part of other parties to pursue similar claims and, in the case of intellectual property claims, require us to change our technology, change our business practices, pay monetary damages or enter into short- or long-term royalty or licensing agreements. Any adverse determination related to intellectual property claims or other litigation could prevent us from offering our services to others, could be material to our financial condition or cash flows, or both, or could otherwise adversely affect our operating results. In addition, depending on the nature and timing of any such dispute, an unfavorable resolution of a legal matter could materially affect our current or future results of operations or cash flows in a particular quarter. Any failure to protect our intellectual property rights could impair our ability to protect our proprietary technology and our brand, cause us to incur significant expenses and harm our business. If we fail to protect our intellectual property rights adequately, our competitors may gain access to our technology, affecting our brand, causing us to incur significant expenses and harming our business. Any of our patents, trademarks or other intellectual property rights may be challenged by others or invalidated through administrative process or litigation. While we have many U.S. patents and pending U.S. and international patent applications, we may be unable to obtain patent protection for the technology covered in our patent applications or the patent protection may not be obtained quickly enough to meet our business needs. In addition, our existing patents and any patents issued in the future may not provide us with competitive advantages, or may be successfully challenged by third parties. Furthermore, legal standards relating to the validity, enforceability and scope of protection of intellectual property rights are uncertain, and we also may face proposals to change the scope of protection for some intellectual property rights in the U.S. Effective patent, trademark, copyright and trade secret protection may not be available to us in every country in which our services are available. The laws of some foreign countries may not be as protective of intellectual property rights as those in the U.S., and mechanisms for enforcement of intellectual property rights may be inadequate. Also, our involvement in standard setting activity or the need to obtain licenses from others may require us to license our intellectual property. Accordingly, despite our efforts, we may be unable to prevent third parties from using our intellectual property. We may be required to spend significant resources and expense to monitor and protect our intellectual property rights. We may initiate claims or litigation against third parties for infringement of our proprietary rights or to establish the validity of our proprietary rights. If we fail to protect our intellectual property rights, it could impact our ability to protect our technology and brand. Furthermore, any litigation, whether or not it is resolved in our favor, could result in significant expense to us, cause us to divert time and resources and harm our business. Our continued success depends on our ability to maintain and enhance our brands. We believe that the brand identities we have developed have significantly contributed to the success of our business. Maintaining and enhancing the Salesforce brand and our other brands are critical to expanding our base of customers, partners and employees. Our brand strength will depend largely on our ability to remain a technology leader and continue to provide high-quality innovative products, services, and features securely, reliably and in a manner that enhances our customers' success. In order to maintain and enhance our brands, we may be required to make substantial investments that may later prove to be unsuccessful. In addition, positions we take on social issues may be unpopular with some customers or potential customers, which may impact our ability to attract or retain such customers. Our brand is also associated with our public commitments to sustainability and equality, and any perceived changes in our dedication to these commitments could adversely impact our relationships with our customers. In addition, we have secured the naming rights to facilities controlled by third parties, such as office towers and a transit center, and any negative events or publicity arising from these facilities could adversely impact our brand. If we fail to maintain and enhance our brands, or if we incur excessive expenses in our efforts to do so, our business, operating results and financial condition may be materially and adversely affected. We may lose key members of our management team or development and operations personnel, and may be unable to attract and retain employees we need to support our operations and growth. Our success depends substantially upon the continued services of our executive officers and other key members of management, particularly our Chief Executive Officer. From time to time, there may be changes in our executive management team resulting from the hiring or departure of executives. Such changes in our executive management team may be disruptive to our business. We are also substantially dependent on the continued service of our existing development and operations personnel because of the complexity of our services and technologies. We do not have employment agreements with any of our executive officers, key management, development or operations personnel and they could terminate their employment with us at any time. The loss of one or more of our key employees or groups could seriously harm our business. In the technology industry, there is substantial and continuous competition for engineers with high levels of experience in designing, developing and managing software and Internet-related services, as well as competition for sales executives, data scientists and operations personnel. We may not be successful in attracting and retaining qualified personnel. We have from time to time experienced, and we expect to continue to experience, difficulty in hiring and retaining highly skilled employees with appropriate qualifications. These difficulties may be amplified by evolving restrictions on immigration, travel or availability of visas for skilled technology workers. If we fail to attract new personnel or fail to retain and motivate our current personnel, our business and future growth prospects could be severely harmed. In addition, we believe in the importance of our corporate culture of Ohana, which fosters dialogue, collaboration, recognition and a sense of family. As our organization grows and expands globally, and as employees workplace expectations develop, we may find it increasingly difficult to maintain the beneficial aspects of our corporate culture. This could negatively impact our ability to attract and retain employees and negatively impact our future growth. Any failure in our delivery of high-quality technical support services may adversely affect our relationships with our customers and our financial results. Our customers depend on our support organization to resolve technical issues relating to our applications. We may be unable to respond quickly enough to accommodate short-term increases in customer demand for support services. Increased customer demand for these services, without corresponding revenues, could increase costs and adversely affect our operating results. In addition, our sales process is highly dependent on our applications and business reputation and on positive recommendations from our existing customers. Any failure to maintain high-quality technical support, or a market perception that we do not maintain high-quality support, could adversely affect our reputation, our ability to sell our service offerings to existing and prospective customers, and our business, operating results and financial position. Periodic changes to our sales organization can be disruptive and may reduce our rate of growth. We periodically change and make adjustments to our sales organization in response to market opportunities, competitive threats, management changes, product introductions or enhancements, acquisitions, sales performance, increases in sales headcount, cost levels and other internal and external considerations. Any such future sales organization changes may result in a temporary reduction of productivity, which could negatively impact our rate of growth. In addition, any significant change to the way we structure our compensation of our sales organization may be disruptive and may affect our revenue growth. Unanticipated changes in our effective tax rate and additional tax liabilities may impact our financial results. We are subject to income taxes in the United States and various jurisdictions outside of the United States. Our effective tax rate could fluctuate due to changes in the mix of earnings and losses in countries with differing statutory tax rates. Our tax expense could also be impacted by changes in non-deductible expenses, changes in excess tax benefits of stock-based compensation, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities and our ability to utilize them, the applicability of withholding taxes and effects from acquisitions. We are subject to tax examinations in multiple jurisdictions. While we regularly evaluate new information that may change our judgment resulting in recognition, derecognition or change in measurement of a tax position taken, there can be no assurance that the final determination of any examinations will not have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial position. Our tax provision could also be impacted by changes in accounting principles, and changes in U.S. federal and state or international tax laws applicable to corporate multinationals. For example, the 2017 U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (\"Tax Act\") significantly changed income tax law that affect U.S. corporations. We made significant judgments and assumptions in the interpretation of this new law and in our calculations of the provisional amounts reflected in our financial statements. The U.S. Treasury Department, the Internal Revenue Service (\"IRS\"), and other standard-setting bodies may issue guidance on how the provisions of the Tax Act will be applied or otherwise administered, and additional accounting guidance or interpretations may be issued in the future that is different from our current interpretation. As we further analyze the new law, and collect relevant information to complete our computations of the related accounting impact, we may make adjustments to the provisional amounts that could materially affect our provision for income taxes in the period in which the adjustments are made. In addition, other countries are considering fundamental tax law changes. Any changes in taxing jurisdictions' administrative interpretations, decisions, policies and positions could also impact our tax liabilities. We may also be subject to additional tax liabilities and penalties due to changes in non-income based taxes resulting from changes in federal, state or international tax laws, changes in taxing jurisdictions administrative interpretations, decisions, policies, and positions, results of tax examinations, settlements or judicial decisions, changes in accounting principles, changes to the business operations, including acquisitions, as well as the evaluation of new information that results in a change to a tax position taken in a prior period. Our debt service obligations and operating lease commitments may adversely affect our financial condition and cash flows from operations. We have a substantial level of debt, including the 0.25% convertible senior notes we issued in March 2013 (0.25% Senior Notes) due April 1, 2018, the loan we assumed when we purchased an office building located at 50 Fremont Street in San Francisco, California (50 Fremont), the $500.0 million term loan to finance our acquisition of Demandware, due July 2019 (the term loan) and capital lease arrangements. Additionally, we have significant contractual commitments in operating lease arrangements, which are not reflected on our consolidated balance sheets. In addition, we have a financing obligation for a leased facility of which we are deemed the owner for accounting purposes. In July 2016, we amended and restated our revolving credit facility under which we can draw down up to $1.0 billion. Maintenance of our indebtedness and contractual commitments and any additional issuances of indebtedness could: ##TABLE_START  impair our ability to obtain additional financing in the future for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, general corporate or other purposes; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  cause us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flows from operations towards debt service obligations and principal repayments; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  make us more vulnerable to downturns in our business, our industry or the economy in general; and ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  due to limitations within the revolving credit facility and term loan covenants, restrict our ability to incur additional indebtedness, grant liens, merge or consolidate, dispose of assets, make investments, make acquisitions, enter into transactions with affiliates, pay dividends or make distributions, repurchase stock and enter into restrictive agreements, as defined in the credit agreement. ##TABLE_END Our ability to meet our expenses and debt obligations will depend on our future performance, which will be affected by financial, business, economic, regulatory and other factors. We will not be able to control many of these factors, such as economic conditions and governmental regulations. Further, our operations may not generate sufficient cash to enable us to service our debt or contractual obligations resulting from our leases. If we fail to make a payment on our debt, we could be in default on such debt. If we are at any time unable to generate sufficient cash flows from operations to service our indebtedness when payment is due, we may be required to attempt to renegotiate the terms of the instruments relating to the indebtedness, seek to refinance all or a portion of the indebtedness or obtain additional financing. There can be no assurance that we would be able to successfully renegotiate such terms, that any such refinancing would be possible or that any additional financing could be obtained on terms that are favorable or acceptable to us. A failure to comply with the covenants and other provisions of our outstanding debt could result in events of default under such instruments, which could permit acceleration of all of our notes and borrowings. Any required repayment of our notes or revolving credit facility as a result of a fundamental change or other acceleration would lower our current cash on hand such that we would not have those funds available for use in our business. New lease accounting guidance will require that we record operating lease activity on our consolidated balance sheet no later than fiscal 2020, which will result in an increase in both our assets and financing obligations. The implementation of this guidance may impact our ability to obtain the necessary financing from financial institutions at commercially viable rates or at all as this new guidance will result in a higher financing obligation on our consolidated balance sheet. Weakened global economic conditions may adversely affect our industry, business and results of operations. Our overall performance depends in part on worldwide economic and geopolitical conditions. The United States and other key international economies have experienced cyclical downturns from time to time in which economic activity was impacted by falling demand for a variety of goods and services, restricted credit, poor liquidity, reduced corporate profitability, volatility in credit, equity and foreign exchange markets, bankruptcies and overall uncertainty with respect to the economy. These economic conditions can arise suddenly and the full impact of such conditions can remain uncertain. In addition, geopolitical developments can increase levels of political and economic unpredictability globally and increase the volatility of global financial markets. Moreover, these conditions can affect the rate of information technology spending and could adversely affect our customers ability or willingness to purchase our enterprise cloud computing services, delay prospective customers purchasing decisions, reduce the value or duration of their subscription contracts, or affect attrition rates, all of which could adversely affect our future sales and operating results. Natural disasters and other events beyond our control could materially adversely affect us. Natural disasters or other catastrophic events may cause damage or disruption to our operations, international commerce and the global economy, and thus could have a strong negative effect on us. Our business operations are subject to interruption by natural disasters, fire, power shortages, pandemics and other events beyond our control. Although we maintain crisis management and disaster response plans, such events could make it difficult or impossible for us to deliver our services to our customers, and could decrease demand for our services. Our corporate headquarters, and a significant portion of our research and development activities, information technology systems, and other critical business operations, are located near major seismic faults in the San Francisco Bay Area. Because we do not carry earthquake insurance for direct quake-related losses, with the exception of the building that we own in San Francisco, and significant recovery time could be required to resume operations, our financial condition and operating results could be materially adversely affected in the event of a major earthquake or catastrophic event. Climate change may have a long-term impact on our business. While we seek to partner with organizations that mitigate their business risks associated with climate change, we recognize that there are inherent climate related risks wherever business is conducted. Access to clean water and reliable energy in the communities where we conduct our business, whether for our offices, vendors, customers or other stakeholders, is a priority. Any of our primary locations may be vulnerable to the adverse effects of climate change. Climate related events have the potential to disrupt our business and may cause us to experience losses and additional costs to resume operations. Current and future accounting pronouncements and other financial reporting standards, especially but not only concerning revenue recognition, cost capitalization and lease accounting, may negatively impact our financial results. We regularly monitor our compliance with applicable financial reporting standards and review new pronouncements and drafts thereof that are relevant to us. As a result of new standards, changes to existing standards and changes in their interpretation, we might be required to change our accounting policies, particularly concerning revenue recognition, the capitalized incremental costs to obtain a customer contract and lease accounting, to alter our operational policies and to implement new or enhance existing systems so that they reflect new or amended financial reporting standards, or to restate our published financial statements. Such changes may have an adverse effect on our business, financial position, and operating results, or cause an adverse deviation from our revenue and operating profit target, which may negatively impact our financial results. We may be subject to risks related to government contracts and related procurement regulations. Our contracts with federal, state, local, and foreign government entities are subject to various procurement regulations and other requirements relating to their formation, administration and performance. We may be subject to audits and investigations relating to our government contracts, and any violations could result in various civil and criminal penalties and administrative sanctions, including termination of contract, refunding or suspending of payments, forfeiture of profits, payment of fines, and suspension or debarment from future government business. In addition, such contracts may provide for termination by the government at any time, without cause. Any of these risks related to contracting with governmental entities could adversely impact our future sales and operating results We are subject to governmental export and import controls that could impair our ability to compete in international markets and subject us to liability if we are not in full compliance with applicable laws. Our solutions are subject to export and import controls, including the Commerce Departments Export Administration Regulations, U.S. Customs regulations and various economic and trade sanctions regulations established by the Treasury Departments Office of Foreign Assets Control. If we fail to comply with these U.S. export control laws and import laws we and certain of our employees could be subject to substantial civil or criminal penalties, including the possible loss of export or import privileges; fines, which may be imposed on us and responsible employees or managers; and, in extreme cases, the incarceration of responsible employees or managers. Obtaining the necessary authorizations, including any required license, may be time-consuming, is not guaranteed and may result in the delay or loss of sales opportunities. Furthermore, the U.S. export control laws and economic sanctions laws prohibit the shipment of certain products and services to U.S. embargoed or sanctioned countries, governments and persons. Even though we take precautions to prevent our solutions from being provisioned or provided to U.S. sanctions targets, our solutions could be provisioned to those targets or provided by our resellers despite such precautions. Any such sales could have negative consequences, including government investigations, penalties and reputational harm. Changes in our solutions or changes in export and import regulations may create delays in the introduction, sale and deployment of our solutions in international markets or prevent the export or import of our solutions to certain countries, governments or persons altogether. Any decreased use of our solutions or limitation on our ability to export or sell our solutions would likely adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Risks Relating to Our Convertible Senior Notes and Our Common Stock The market price of our common stock is likely to be volatile and could subject us to litigation. The trading prices of the securities of technology companies have historically been highly volatile. Accordingly, the market price of our notes and common stock has been and is likely to continue to be subject to wide fluctuations. Factors affecting the market price of our notes and common stock include: ##TABLE_START  variations in our operating results, earnings per share, cash flows from operating activities, deferred revenue, both billed and unbilled, year-over-year growth rates for individual core service offerings and other financial metrics and non-financial metrics, such as transaction usage volumes and Einstein predictions, and how those results compare to analyst expectations; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  variations in, and limitations of, the various financial and other metrics and modeling used by analysts in their research and reports about our business; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  forward-looking guidance to industry and financial analysts related to, for example, future revenue and earnings per share; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  changes in the estimates of our operating results or changes in recommendations by securities analysts that elect to follow our common stock; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  announcements of technological innovations, new services or service enhancements, strategic alliances or significant agreements by us or by our competitors; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  announcements by us or by our competitors of mergers or other strategic acquisitions, or rumors of such transactions involving us or our competitors; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  announcements of customer additions and customer cancellations or delays in customer purchases; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  the coverage of our common stock by the financial media, including television, radio and press reports and blogs; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  recruitment or departure of key personnel; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  disruptions in our service due to computer hardware, software, network or data center problems; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  the economy as a whole, market conditions in our industry and the industries of our customers; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  trading activity by a limited number of stockholders who together beneficially own a significant portion of our outstanding common stock; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  the issuance of shares of common stock by us, whether in connection with an acquisition, a capital raising transaction or upon conversion of some or all of our outstanding convertible senior notes; and ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  issuance of debt or other convertible securities. ##TABLE_END In addition, if the market for technology stocks or the stock market in general experiences uneven investor confidence, the market price of our notes and common stock could decline for reasons unrelated to our business, operating results or financial condition. The market price of our notes and common stock might also decline in reaction to events that affect other companies within, or outside, our industry even if these events do not directly affect us. Some companies that have experienced volatility in the trading price of their stock have been the subject of securities class action litigation. If we are the subject of such litigation, it could result in substantial costs and a diversion of managements attention and resources. We may issue additional shares of our common stock or instruments convertible into shares of our common stock, including in connection with the conversion of the notes, and thereby materially and adversely affect the market price of our common stock and the trading price of the notes. We are not restricted from issuing additional shares of our common stock or other instruments convertible into, or exchangeable or exercisable for, shares of our common stock during the life of the notes. If we issue additional shares of our common stock or instruments convertible into shares of our common stock, it may materially and adversely affect the market price of our common stock and, in turn, the trading price of the notes. In addition, the conversion of some or all of the notes may dilute the ownership interests of existing holders of our common stock, and any sales in the public market of any shares of our common stock issuable upon such conversion of the notes could adversely affect the prevailing market price of our common stock. In addition, the potential conversion of the notes could depress the market price of our common stock. We may not have the ability to pay the amount of cash due upon conversion of the notes or the fundamental change purchase price due when a holder submits its notes for purchase upon the occurrence of a fundamental change. Upon the occurrence of a fundamental change, holders of the notes may require us to purchase, for cash, all or a portion of their notes. In addition, if a holder converts its notes, we will generally pay such holder an amount of cash before delivering to such holder any shares of our common stock. There can be no assurance that we will have sufficient financial resources, or will be able to arrange financing, to pay the fundamental change purchase price if holders submit their notes for purchase by us upon the occurrence of a fundamental change or to pay the amount of cash due if holders surrender their notes for conversion. In addition, agreements governing any future debt may restrict our ability to make each of the required cash payments even if we have sufficient funds to make them. Furthermore, our ability to purchase the notes or to pay cash upon the conversion of the notes may be limited by law or regulatory authority. If we fail to purchase the notes, to pay interest due on the notes, or to pay the amount of cash due upon conversion, we will be in default under the indenture, which in turn may result in the acceleration of other indebtedness we may then have. If the repayment of the other indebtedness were to be accelerated, we may not have sufficient funds to repay that indebtedness and to purchase the notes or to pay the amount of cash due upon conversion. Our inability to pay for the notes that are tendered for purchase or upon conversion could result in note holders receiving substantially less than the principal amount of the notes, which could harm our reputation, financing opportunities and our business. The fundamental change provisions of the notes may delay or prevent an otherwise beneficial takeover attempt of us. The fundamental change purchase rights will allow holders of the notes to require us to purchase all or a portion of their notes upon the occurrence of a fundamental change. The provisions requiring an increase to the conversion rate for conversions in connection with a make-whole fundamental change may, in certain circumstances, delay or prevent a takeover of us and the removal of incumbent management that might otherwise be beneficial to investors. The convertible note hedges and warrant transactions may affect the trading price of the notes and the market price of our common stock. We entered into privately negotiated convertible note hedge transactions with certain hedge counterparties concurrently with the pricing of the notes. We also entered into privately negotiated warrant transactions with the hedge counterparties. Taken together, the convertible note hedge transactions and the warrant transactions are expected, but not guaranteed, to reduce the potential dilution with respect to our common stock upon conversion of the notes. If, however, the price of our common stock, as measured under the terms of the warrant transactions, exceeds the exercise price of the warrant transactions, the warrant transactions will have a dilutive effect on our earnings per share to the extent that the price of our common stock as measured under the warrant transactions exceeds the strike price of the warrant transactions. The hedge counterparties and their respective affiliates periodically modify their hedge positions from time to time following the pricing of the notes (and are particularly likely to do so during any observation period relating to a conversion of the notes) by entering into or unwinding various over-the-counter derivative transactions with respect to our common stock, or by purchasing or selling shares of our common stock or the notes in privately negotiated transactions or open market transactions. The effect, if any, of these transactions and activities on the market price of our common stock or the trading price of the notes will depend in part on market conditions and cannot be ascertained at this time. Any of these activities could adversely affect the market price of our common stock and the trading price of the notes. We do not make any representation or prediction as to the direction or magnitude of any potential effect that the transactions described above may have on the price of the notes or our common stock. In addition, we do not make any representation that the counterparties to those transactions will engage in these transactions or activities or that these transactions and activities, once commenced, will not be discontinued without notice; the counterparties or their affiliates may choose to engage in, or discontinue engaging in, any of these transactions or activities with or without notice at any time, and their decisions will be in their sole discretion and not within our control. We are subject to counterparty risk with respect to the convertible note hedge transactions. The hedge counterparties are financial institutions or affiliates of financial institutions, and we will be subject to the risk that these hedge counterparties may default under the convertible note hedge transactions. Our exposure to the credit risk of the hedge counterparties will not be secured by any collateral. If one or more of the hedge counterparties to one or more of our convertible note hedge transactions becomes subject to insolvency proceedings, we will become an unsecured creditor in those proceedings with a claim equal to our exposure at the time under those transactions. Our exposure will depend on many factors but, generally, the increase in our exposure will be correlated to the increase in our stock price and the volatility of our stock. In addition, upon a default by one of the hedge counterparties, we may suffer adverse tax consequences and dilution with respect to our common stock. We can provide no assurances as to the financial stability or viability of any of the hedge counterparties. Provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws and Delaware law might discourage, delay or prevent a change of control of our company or changes in our management and, therefore, depress the market price of our common stock. Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that could depress the market price of our common stock by acting to discourage, delay or prevent a change in control of our company or changes in our management that the stockholders of our company may deem advantageous. These provisions among other things: ##TABLE_START  permit the board of directors to establish the number of directors; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  provide that directors may only be removed with the approval of holders of 66 2/3 percent of our outstanding capital stock; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  require super-majority voting to amend some provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  authorize the issuance of blank check preferred stock that our board could use to implement a stockholder rights plan (also known as a poison pill); ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  prohibit stockholder action by written consent, which requires all stockholder actions to be taken at a meeting of our stockholders; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  provide that the board of directors is expressly authorized to make, alter or repeal our bylaws; and ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  establish advance notice requirements for nominations for election to our board or for proposing matters that can be acted upon by stockholders at annual stockholder meetings. ##TABLE_END In addition, Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law may discourage, delay or prevent a change in control of our company. Section 203 imposes certain restrictions on merger, business combinations and other transactions between us and holders of 15 percent or more of our common stock. In addition, the fundamental change purchase rights applicable to the notes, which will allow note holders to require us to purchase all or a portion of their notes upon the occurrence of a fundamental change, and the provisions requiring an increase to the conversion rate for conversions in connection with a make-whole fundamental change, may in certain circumstances delay or prevent a takeover of us and the removal of incumbent management that might otherwise be beneficial to investors. ", "1B": " ITEM 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS None. ", "2": " ITEM 2. PROPERTIES As of January 31, 2018 , our executive and principal offices for sales, marketing, professional services and development consist of approximately 1.8 million square feet of leased and owned property in San Francisco. Of this total, we lease and occupy approximately 1.1 million square feet and own and occupy a majority of the approximately 820,000 square feet of total owned space at 50 Fremont Street. Of the total space in San Francisco, 1.2 million square feet is concentrated in our urban campus, which includes 50 Fremont Street, 350 Mission Street, and Salesforce Tower located at 415 Mission Street (\"Salesforce Tower\"), collectively defined as our \"Urban Campus\". We also lease space in various locations throughout the United States for local sales and professional services personnel. Our foreign subsidiaries lease office space in a number of countries in Europe, North America, Asia, South America, Africa and Australia for our international operations, primarily for local sales and professional services personnel. In addition, in April 2014, we entered into a lease agreement for approximately 882,000 rentable square feet in Salesforce Tower. The lease payments associated with the lease will be approximately $774.1 million over the 15.5 year term of the lease, beginning in our second quarter of fiscal 2018. We currently occupy 97,000 square feet of this property, and we have included this amount in the total leased space in San Francisco stated above. We operate data centers in the U.S., Europe and Asia pursuant to various co-location lease arrangements. We believe that our existing facilities and offices are adequate to meet our current requirements. If we require additional space, we believe that we will be able to obtain such space on acceptable, commercially reasonable terms. ##TABLE_START ", "3": " ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS ##TABLE_END In the ordinary course of business, we are or may be involved in various legal or regulatory proceedings, claims, or purported class actions related to alleged infringement of third-party patents and other intellectual property rights, or alleged violation of commercial, corporate and securities, labor and employment, wage and hour, or other laws or regulations. We have been, and may in the future be put on notice and/or sued by third parties for alleged infringement of their proprietary rights, including patent infringement. We evaluate all claims and lawsuits with respect to their potential merits, our potential defenses and counterclaims, settlement or litigation potential and the expected effect on us. Our technologies may be subject to injunction if they are found to infringe the rights of a third-party. In addition, many of our subscription agreements require us to indemnify our customers for third-party intellectual property infringement claims, which could increase the cost to us of an adverse ruling on such a claim. The outcome of any claims or litigation, regardless of the merits, is inherently uncertain. Any claims and other lawsuits, and the disposition of such claims and lawsuits, whether through settlement or litigation, could be time-consuming and expensive to resolve, divert our attention from executing our business plan, result in efforts to enjoin our activities, lead to attempts by third parties to seek similar claims and, in the case of intellectual property claims, require us to change our technology, change our business practices, pay monetary damages or enter into short- or long-term royalty or licensing agreements. In general, the resolution of a legal matter could prevent us from offering our service to others, could be material to our financial condition or cash flows, or both, or could otherwise adversely affect our operating results. We make a provision for a liability relating to legal matters when it is both probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. These provisions are reviewed at least quarterly and adjusted to reflect the impacts of negotiations, estimated settlements, legal rulings, advice of legal counsel and other information and events pertaining to a particular matter. The outcomes of our legal proceedings and other contingencies are, however, inherently unpredictable and subject to significant uncertainties. As a result, we may not be able to reasonably estimate the amount or range of possible losses in excess of any amounts accrued, including losses that could arise as a result of application of non-monetary remedies, with respect to any contingencies, and our estimates may not prove to be accurate. In our opinion, resolution of all current matters is not expected to have a material adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations, cash flows or financial position. However, depending on the nature and timing of a given dispute or other contingency, an unfavorable resolution could materially affect our current or future results of operations or cash flows, or both, in a particular quarter.

The consolidated statement of operations data for fiscal 2015 and 2014 and the consolidated balance sheet data as of January 31, 2016 , 2015 and 2014 are derived from audited consolidated financial statements which are not included in this Form 10-K after certain reclassifications were made to conform to the current period presentation described in Note 1 \"Summary of Business and Significant Accounting Policies\" of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, which is incorporated herein by reference. ##TABLE_START  Fiscal Year Ended January 31, (in thousands, except per share data)     Consolidated Statement of Operations          Revenues:          Subscription and support $ 9,710,538  $ 7,756,205  $ 6,205,599  $ 5,013,764  $ 3,824,542 Professional services and other 769,474  635,779  461,617  359,822  246,461 Total revenues 10,480,012  8,391,984  6,667,216  5,373,586  4,071,003 Cost of revenues (1)(2)(3):          Subscription and support 2,033,457  1,617,315  1,241,692  964,608  734,321 Professional services and other 740,065  616,724  412,856  324,662  234,107 Total cost of revenues 2,773,522  2,234,039  1,654,548  1,289,270  968,428 Gross profit 7,706,490  6,157,945  5,012,668  4,084,316  3,102,575 Operating expenses (1)(2):          Research and development 1,553,073  1,208,127  946,300  792,917  623,798 Marketing and sales 4,829,291  3,918,027  3,239,824  2,757,096  2,168,132 General and administrative 1,088,358  967,563  748,238  679,936  596,719 Operating lease termination resulting from purchase of 50 Fremont   (36,617 )   Total operating expenses 7,470,722  6,093,717  4,897,745  4,229,949  3,388,649 Income (loss) from operations 235,768  64,228  114,923  (145,633 )  (286,074 ) Investment income 35,848  27,374  15,341  10,038  10,218 Interest expense (86,943 )  (88,988 )  (72,485 )  (73,237 )  (77,211 ) Other income (expense) (1) 17,435  9,072  (15,292 )  (19,878 )  (4,868 ) Gain on sales of land and building improvements   21,792  15,625  Gains from acquisitions of strategic investments  13,697    Income (loss) before benefit from (provision for) income taxes 202,108  25,383  64,279  (213,085 )  (357,935 ) Benefit from (provision for) income taxes (74,630 )  154,249  (111,705 )  (49,603 )  125,760 Net income (loss) $ 127,478  $ 179,632  $ (47,426 )  $ (262,688 )  $ (232,175 ) Net income (loss) per share-basic and diluted:          Basic net income (loss) per share $ 0.18  $ 0.26  $ (0.07 )  $ (0.42 )  $ (0.39 ) Diluted net income (loss) per share $ 0.17  $ 0.26  $ (0.07 )  $ (0.42 )  $ (0.39 ) Shares used in computing basic net income (loss) per share 714,919  687,797  661,647  624,148  597,613 Shares used in computing diluted net income (loss) per share 734,598  700,217  661,647  624,148  597,613 ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Fiscal Year Ended January 31, (in thousands)     (1) Amounts include amortization of purchased intangibles from business combinations, as follows:          Cost of revenues $ 165,545  $ 127,676  $ 80,918  $ 90,300  $ 109,356 Marketing and sales 121,340  97,601  77,152  64,673  37,179 Other income (expense) 1,433  2,491  3,636   (2) Amounts include stock-based expenses, as follows:          Cost of revenues $ 129,954  $ 107,457  $ 69,443  $ 53,812  $ 45,608 Research and development 259,838  187,487  129,434  121,193  107,420 Marketing and sales 468,553  388,937  289,152  286,410  258,571 General and administrative 138,668  136,486  105,599  103,350  91,681 ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (3) Certain reclassifications to fiscal 2017, 2016 , 2015 and 2014 balances were made to conform to the current period presentation in the consolidated statement of operations, which include cost of revenues-subscription and support and cost of revenues-professional services and other. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  As of January 31, (in thousands)     Consolidated Balance Sheet Data:          Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities (4) $ 4,521,705  $ 2,208,887  $ 2,725,377  $ 1,890,284  $ 1,321,017 (Negative) working capital (5) (839,147 )  (1,298,639 )  90,432  (15,385 )  (915,382 ) Total assets 21,009,802  17,584,923  12,762,920  10,654,053  9,096,124 Long-term obligations (6) 1,487,921  2,789,330  2,119,160  2,254,086  2,002,311 Accumulated deficit (337,432 )  (464,910 )  (653,271 )  (605,845 )  (343,157 ) Total stockholders equity 9,388,496  7,500,127  5,002,869  3,975,183  3,038,510 ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (4) Excludes the restricted cash balance of $115.0 million as of January 31, 2015. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (5) The Company considers all its marketable debt securities to be available to support current liquidity needs including those with maturity dates beyond one year, and therefore classifies these securities within current assets on the consolidated balance sheets. For consistency in presentation, working capital in the table above as of January 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 includes amounts previously reported in Marketable securities, noncurrent. In addition, other reclassifications were made to balances as of January 31, 2017, 2016 , 2015 and 2014 to conform to the current period presentation. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (6) Long-term obligations consists of the 0.75% convertible senior notes issued in January 2010, the 0.25% convertible senior notes issued in March 2013, the term loan entered into in July 2013, which was subsequently paid off in fiscal 2016, the loan assumed on 50 Fremont, the term loan entered into in July 2016, and the revolving credit facility entered into in October 2014 and amended in July 2016. At January 31, 2014, the 0.75% notes were convertible and accordingly were classified as a current liability. At January 31, 2015, the 0.75% notes had matured and were no longer outstanding. At January 31, 2018, the 0.25% notes were due in April 2018 and accordingly were classified as a current liability. As of January 31, 2018, a portion of the loan assumed on 50 Fremont was due within the next 12 months and accordingly was classified as a current liability. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START ", "7": " ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS ##TABLE_ENDThe following discussion contains forward-looking statements, including, without limitation, our expectations and statements regarding our outlook and future revenues, expenses, results of operations, liquidity, plans, strategies and objectives of management and any assumptions underlying any of the foregoing. Our actual results may differ significantly from those projected in the forward-looking statements. Our forward-looking statements and factors that might cause future actual results to differ materially from our recent results or those projected in the forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, those discussed in the section titled Forward-Looking Information and Risk Factors of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Except as required by law, we assume no obligation to update the forward-looking statements or our risk factors for any reason. Overview We are a leading provider of enterprise cloud computing solutions, with a focus on customer relationship management, or CRM. We introduced our first CRM solution in 2000, and we have since expanded our service offerings with new editions, features and platform capabilities. Our core mission is to empower our customers to connect with their customers in entirely new ways through cloud, mobile, social, Internet of Things (IoT) and artificial intelligence technologies. Our Customer Success Platform - including sales force automation, customer service and support, marketing automation, digital commerce, community management, industry-specific solutions, analytics, application development, IoT integration, collaborative productivity tools, our AppExchange, which is our enterprise cloud marketplace, and our professional cloud services - provides the tools customers need to succeed in a digital world. Key elements of our strategy include: ##TABLE_START  cross sell and upsell; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  extend existing service offerings; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  reduce customer attrition; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  expand and strengthen the partner ecosystem; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  expand internationally; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  target vertical industries; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  expand into new horizontal markets; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  extend go-to-market capabilities; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  ensure strong customer adoption; and ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  encourage the development of third-party applications on our cloud computing platform. ##TABLE_END We are also committed to a sustainable, low-carbon future, advancing equality and diversity, and fostering employee success. We try to integrate social good into everything we do. All of these goals align with our long-term growth strategy and financial and operational priorities. We believe the factors that will influence our ability to achieve our objectives include: our prospective customers willingness to migrate to enterprise cloud computing services; our ability to maintain a balanced portfolio of products and customers; the availability, performance and security of our service; our ability to continue to release, and gain customer acceptance of new and improved features; our ability to successfully integrate acquired businesses and technologies; successful customer adoption and utilization of our service; our ability to continue to meet new and evolving privacy laws and regulations, acceptance of our service in markets where we have few customers; the emergence of additional competitors in our market and improved product offerings by existing and new competitors; the location of new data centers that we operate as well as the new locations of services provided by third-party cloud computing platform providers; third-party developers willingness to develop applications on our platforms; our ability to attract new personnel and retain and motivate current personnel; and general economic conditions which could affect our customers ability and willingness to purchase our services, delay the customers purchasing decision or affect attrition rates. To address these factors, we will need to, among other things, continue to add substantial numbers of paying subscriptions, upgrade our customers to fully featured versions or arrangements such as an Enterprise License Agreement, provide high quality technical support to our customers, encourage the development of third-party applications on our platforms, realize the benefits from our strategic partnerships and continue to focus on retaining customers at the time of renewal. Our plans to invest for future growth include the continuation of the expansion of our data center capacity, whether internally or through the use of third parties, the hiring of additional personnel, particularly in direct sales, other customer-related areas and research and development, the expansion of domestic and international selling and marketing activities, specifically in our top markets, the continued development of our brands, the addition of distribution channels, the upgrade of our service offerings, the continued development of services including Community Cloud, Industry Clouds and Success Cloud, the integration of new and acquired technologies such as Commerce Cloud, artificial intelligence technologies and Salesforce Quip, the expansion of our Marketing Cloud and Salesforce Platform core service offerings, and the additions to our global infrastructure to support our growth. We also regularly evaluate acquisitions or investment opportunities in complementary businesses, joint ventures, services and technologies and intellectual property rights in an effort to expand our service offerings. We expect to continue to make such investments and acquisitions in the future and we plan to reinvest a significant portion of our incremental revenue in future periods to grow our business and continue our leadership role in the cloud computing industry. As part of our growth strategy, we are delivering innovative solutions in new categories, including analytics, e-commerce, artificial intelligence, IoT and collaborative productivity tools. We drive innovation organically and to a lesser extent through acquisitions, such as our July 2016 acquisition of Demandware, Inc. (Demandware), a digital commerce leader. We have a disciplined and thoughtful acquisition process where we routinely survey the industry landscape across a wide range of companies. As a result of our aggressive growth plans and integration of our previously acquired businesses, we have incurred significant expenses from equity awards and amortization of purchased intangibles, which have reduced our operating income. We remain focused on improving operating margins in fiscal 2019 and beyond. Our typical subscription contract term is 12 to 36 months, although terms range from one to 60 months, so during any fiscal reporting period only a subset of active subscription contracts is eligible for renewal. We calculate our attrition rate as of the end of each month. Our current attrition rate, which does not include the Marketing and Commerce Cloud service offerings, was between eight and nine percent as of January 31, 2018 . Our attrition rate, including the Marketing Cloud service offering, was less than ten percent as of January 31, 2018 . While it is difficult to predict, we expect our attrition rate to remain consistent as we continue to expand our enterprise business and invest in customer success and related programs. We expect marketing and sales costs, which were 46 percent and 47 percent for fiscal 2018 and 2017, respectively, to continue to represent a substantial portion of total revenues in the future as we seek to grow our customer base, sell more products to existing customers, and continue to build greater brand awareness. Fiscal Year Our fiscal year ends on January 31. References to fiscal 2018 , for example, refer to the fiscal year ending January 31, 2018 . Operating Segments We operate as one operating segment. Operating segments are defined as components of an enterprise for which separate financial information is evaluated regularly by the chief operating decision maker, who in our case is the chief executive officer, in deciding how to allocate resources and assess performance. Over the past few years, we have completed a number of acquisitions. These acquisitions have allowed us to expand our offerings, presence and reach in various market segments of the enterprise cloud computing market. While we have offerings in multiple enterprise cloud computing market segments, including as a result of our acquisitions, our business operates in one operating segment because the majority of our offerings operate on a single platform and are deployed in an identical way, and  our chief operating decision maker evaluates our financial information and resources and assesses the performance of these resources on a consolidated basis. Since we operate as one operating segment, all required financial segment information can be found in the consolidated financial statements. Sources of Revenues We derive our revenues from two sources: (1) subscription revenues, which are comprised of subscription fees from customers accessing our enterprise cloud computing services and from customers paying for additional support beyond the standard support that is included in the basic subscription fees; and (2) related professional services such as process mapping, project management, implementation services and other revenue. Other revenue consists primarily of training fees. Subscription and support revenues accounted for approximately 93 percent of our total revenues for fiscal 2018 . Subscription revenues are driven primarily by the number of paying subscribers, varying service types, the price of our service and renewals. We define a customer as a separate and distinct buying entity (e.g., a company, a distinct business unit of a large corporation, a partnership, etc.) that has entered into a contract to access our enterprise cloud computing services. We define a subscription as a unique user account purchased by a customer for use by its employees or other customer-authorized users, and we refer to each such user as a subscriber. The number of paying subscriptions at each of our customers ranges from one to hundreds of thousands. None of our customers accounted for more than five percent of our revenues during fiscal 2018 and 2017 . Subscription and support revenues are recognized ratably over the contract terms beginning on the commencement dates of each contract. The typical subscription and support term is 12 to 36 months, although terms range from one to 60 months. Our subscription and support contracts are non-cancelable, though customers typically have the right to terminate their contracts for cause if we materially fail to perform. We generally invoice our customers in advance, in annual installments, and typical payment terms provide that our customers pay us within 30 days of invoice. Amounts that have been invoiced are recorded in accounts receivable and in deferred revenue, or in revenue depending on whether the revenue recognition criteria have been met. In general, we collect our billings in advance of the subscription service period. Professional services and other revenues consist of fees associated with consulting and implementation services and training. Our consulting and implementation engagements are billed on a time and materials, fixed fee or subscription basis. We also offer a number of training classes on implementing, using and administering our service that are billed on a per person, per class basis. Our typical professional services payment terms provide that our customers pay us within 30 days of invoice. In determining whether professional services can be accounted for separately from subscription and support revenues, we consider a number of factors, which are described in Note 1 Summary of Business and Significant Accounting Policies. Revenue by Cloud Service Offering The information below is provided on a supplemental basis to give additional insight into the revenue performance of our individual core service offerings. All of the cloud offerings that we offer to customers are grouped into four major cloud service offerings. Subscription and support revenues consisted of the following (in millions): ##TABLE_START  Fiscal Year Ended January 31,         Variance - Percent Fiscal 2017 and 2018  Variance - Percent Fiscal 2016 and 2017 Sales Cloud $ 3,554.3  $ 3,060.6  $ 2,699.0  16%  13% Service Cloud 2,877.1  2,320.7  1,817.8  24%  28% Salesforce Platform and Other 1,929.2  1,441.6  1,034.7  34%  39% Marketing and Commerce Cloud 1,349.9  933.3  654.1  45%  43% Total $ 9,710.5  $ 7,756.2  $ 6,205.6     ##TABLE_ENDSubscription and support revenues from the Community Cloud, Quip and our Industry Offerings were not significant in fiscal 2018 . Quip revenue is included with Salesforce Platform and Other in the table above. Our Industry Offerings and Community Cloud revenue are included in either Sales Cloud, Service Cloud or Salesforce Platform and Other depending on the primary service offering purchased. As required under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (U.S. GAAP\"), we recorded deferred revenue related to acquired contracts from Demandware at fair value on the date of acquisition. As a result, we did not recognize certain revenues related to these acquired contracts that Demandware would have otherwise recorded as an independent entity. Of the $1,349.9 million subscription and support revenue for Marketing and Commerce Cloud for fiscal 2018 , approximately $253.4 million was attributed to Commerce Cloud. In situations where a customer purchases multiple cloud offerings, such as through an Enterprise License Agreement, we allocate the contract value to each core service offering based on the customers estimated product demand plan and the service that was provided at the inception of the contract. We do not update these allocations based on actual product usage during the term of the contract. We have allocated approximately 14 percent , 13 percent and 10 percent  of our total subscription and support revenues for fiscal 2018 , 2017 and 2016, respectively, based on customers estimated product demand plans and these allocated amounts are included in the table above. Additionally, some of our service offerings have similar features and functions. For example, customers may use the Sales Cloud, the Service Cloud or our Salesforce Platform to record account and contact information, which are similar features across these core service offerings. Depending on a customers actual and projected business requirements, more than one core service offering may satisfy the customers current and future needs. We record revenue based on the individual products ordered by a customer, not according to the customers business requirements and usage. In addition, as we introduce new features and functions within each offering and refine our allocation methodology for changes in our business, we do not expect it to be practical to adjust historical revenue results by service offering for comparability. Accordingly, comparisons of revenue performance by core service offering over time may not be meaningful. Our Sales Cloud service offering is our most widely distributed service offering and has historically been the largest contributor of subscription and support revenues. As a result, Sales Cloud has the most international exposure and foreign exchange rate exposure relative to the other cloud service offerings. Conversely, revenue for Marketing and Commerce Cloud is primarily derived from the Americas with little impact from foreign exchange rate movement. The revenue growth rates of each of our core service offerings fluctuate from quarter to quarter and over time. While we are a market leader in each core offering, we manage the total balanced product portfolio to deliver solutions to our customers. Accordingly, the revenue result for each cloud service offering is not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for any subsequent quarter. Seasonal Nature of Deferred Revenue, Accounts Receivable and Operating Cash Flow Deferred revenue primarily consists of billings to customers for our subscription service. Over 90 percent of the value of our billings to customers is for our subscription and support service. We generally invoice our customers in annual cycles. Approximately 80 percent of the value of all subscription and support related invoices, excluding Demandware related invoices, were issued with annual terms during fiscal 2018 , 2017 and 2016 . We typically issue renewal invoices in advance of the renewal service period, and depending on timing, the initial invoice for the subscription and services contract and the subsequent renewal invoice may occur in different quarters. This may result in an increase in deferred revenue and accounts receivable. There is a disproportionate weighting toward annual billings in the fourth quarter, primarily as a result of large enterprise account buying patterns. Our fourth quarter has historically been our strongest quarter for new business and renewals. The year on year compounding effect of this seasonality in both billing patterns and overall new and renewal business causes the value of invoices that we generate in the fourth quarter for both new business and renewals to increase as a proportion of our total annual billings. Accordingly, because of this billing activity, our first quarter is our largest collections and operating cash flow quarter. Unbilled Deferred Revenue, an Operational Measure The deferred revenue balance on our consolidated balance sheets does not represent the total contract value of annual or multi-year, non-cancelable subscription agreements. Unbilled deferred revenue is an operational measure that represents future billings under our subscription agreements that have not been invoiced and, accordingly, are not recorded in deferred revenue. Unbilled deferred revenue amounts by quarter are reflected in the table below. Our typical contract length is between 12 and 36 months. We expect that the amount of unbilled deferred revenue will change from quarter to quarter for several reasons, including the specific timing, duration and size of large customer subscription agreements, varying billing cycles of subscription agreements, the specific timing of customer renewals, foreign currency fluctuations, the timing of when unbilled deferred revenue is to be recognized as revenue, and changes in customer financial circumstances. For multi-year subscription agreements billed annually, the associated unbilled deferred revenue is typically high at the beginning of the contract period, zero just prior to renewal, and increases if the agreement is renewed. Low unbilled deferred revenue attributable to a particular subscription agreement is often associated with an impending renewal and may not be an indicator of the likelihood of renewal or future revenue from such customer. Accordingly, we expect that the amount of aggregate unbilled deferred revenue will change from year-to-year depending in part upon the number and dollar amount of subscription agreements at particular stages in their renewal cycle. Such fluctuations are not a reliable indicator of future revenues. Unbilled deferred revenue does not include minimum revenue commitments from indirect sales channels, as we recognize revenue, deferred revenue, and any unbilled deferred revenue upon sell-through to an end user customer. Unbilled deferred revenue also does not include any estimates for overage billings above a customer's minimum commitment. The sequential quarterly changes in accounts receivable and the related deferred revenue and operating cash flow during the first quarter of our fiscal year are not necessarily indicative of the billing activity that occurs for the following quarters as displayed below (in thousands, except unbilled deferred revenue): ##TABLE_START  January 31, 2018  October 31, 2017  July 31, 2017  April 30, 2017 Fiscal 2018        Accounts receivable, net $ 3,917,401  $ 1,519,916  $ 1,569,322  $ 1,439,875 Deferred revenue 7,094,705  4,392,082  4,818,634  5,042,652 Operating cash flow (1) 1,051,320  125,792  331,269  1,229,584 Unbilled deferred revenue 13.3 bn  11.5 bn  10.4 bn  9.6 bn ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  January 31, 2017  October 31, 2016  July 31, 2016  April 30, 2016 Fiscal 2017        Accounts receivable, net $ 3,196,643  $ 1,281,425  $ 1,323,114  $ 1,192,965 Deferred revenue 5,542,802  3,495,133  3,823,561  4,006,914 Operating cash flow (1) 706,146  154,312  250,678  1,051,062 Unbilled deferred revenue 9.0 bn  8.6 bn  8.0 bn  7.6 bn ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  January 31, 2016  October 31, 2015  July 31, 2015  April 30, 2015 Fiscal 2016        Accounts receivable, net $ 2,496,165  $ 1,060,726  $ 1,067,799  $ 926,381 Deferred revenue 4,291,553  2,846,510  3,034,991  3,056,820 Operating cash flow (1) 470,208  162,514  304,278  735,081 Unbilled deferred revenue 7.1 bn  6.7 bn  6.2 bn  6.0 bn ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (1) Operating cash flow represents net cash provided by operating activities for the three months ended in the periods stated above. ##TABLE_ENDCost of Revenues and Operating Expenses Cost of Revenues Cost of subscription and support revenues primarily consists of expenses related to delivering our service and providing support, the costs of data center capacity, depreciation or operating lease expense associated with computer equipment and software, allocated overhead, amortization expense associated with capitalized software related to our services and acquired developed technologies and certain fees paid to various third parties for the use of their technology, services and data. We allocate overhead such as IT infrastructure, rent and occupancy charges based on headcount. Employee benefit costs and taxes are allocated based upon a percentage of total compensation expense. As such, general overhead expenses are reflected in each cost of revenue and operating expense category. Cost of professional services and other revenues consists primarily of employee-related costs associated with these services, including stock-based expenses, the cost of subcontractors, certain third-party fees and allocated overhead. The cost of providing professional services is higher as a percentage of the related revenue than for our enterprise cloud computing subscription service due to the direct labor costs and costs of subcontractors. We intend to continue to invest additional resources in our enterprise cloud computing services. For example, we have invested in additional database software and hardware and we plan to increase the capacity that we are able to offer globally through data centers and third-party infrastructure providers. As we acquire new businesses and technologies, the majority of the amortization expense associated with this activity will be included in cost of revenues. Additionally, as we enter into new contracts with third parties for the use of their technology, services or data, or as our sales volume grows, the fees paid to use such technology or services may increase. Finally, we expect the cost of professional services to be approximately in line with revenues from professional services as we believe this investment in professional services facilitates the adoption of our service offerings. The timing of these additional expenses will affect our cost of revenues, both in terms of absolute dollars and as a percentage of revenues, in the affected periods. Research and Development Research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries and related expenses, including stock-based expenses, the costs of our development and test data center and allocated overhead. We continue to focus our research and development efforts on adding new features and services, integrating acquired technologies, increasing the functionality and security and enhancing the ease of use of our enterprise cloud computing services. Our proprietary, scalable and secure multi-tenant architecture enables us to provide all of our customers with a service based on a single version of our application. As a result, we do not have to maintain multiple versions, which enables us to have relatively lower research and development expenses as compared to traditional enterprise software companies. We expect that in the future, research and development expenses will increase in absolute dollars and may increase as a percentage of total revenues as we invest in adding employees and building the necessary system infrastructure required to support the development of new, and improve existing, technologies and the integration of acquired businesses, technologies and all of our service offerings. Marketing and Sales  Marketing and sales expenses are our largest cost and consist primarily of salaries and related expenses, including stock-based expenses, for our sales and marketing staff, including commissions, as well as payments to partners, marketing programs and allocated overhead. Marketing programs consist of advertising, events, corporate communications, brand building and product marketing activities. We plan to continue to invest in marketing and sales by expanding our domestic and international selling and marketing activities, building brand awareness, attracting new customers and sponsoring additional marketing events. The timing of these marketing events, such as our annual and largest event, Dreamforce, will affect our marketing costs in a particular quarter. In addition, as we acquire new businesses and technologies, a component of the amortization expense associated with this activity will be included in marketing and sales. We expect that in the future, marketing and sales expenses will increase in absolute dollars and continue to be our largest cost. We expect marketing and sales expenses, excluding sales personnel expenses, to grow in line with or at a slower rate than revenues and sales personnel expenses may increase as a percentage of total revenues as we invest in additional sales personnel to focus on adding new customers and increasing penetration within our existing customer base. General and Administrative  General and administrative expenses consist of salaries and related expenses, including stock-based expenses, for finance and accounting, legal, internal audit, human resources and management information systems personnel, legal costs, professional fees, other corporate expenses and allocated overhead. We expect that in the future, general and administrative expenses will increase in absolute dollars as we invest in our infrastructure and we incur additional employee related costs, professional fees and insurance costs related to the growth of our business and international expansion. We expect general and administrative costs as a percentage of total revenues to either remain flat or decrease for the next several quarters. However, the timing of additional expenses in a particular quarter, both in terms of absolute dollars and as a percentage of revenues, will affect our general and administrative expenses. Stock-Based Expenses  Our cost of revenues and operating expenses include stock-based expenses related to equity plans for employees and non-employee directors. We recognize our stock-based compensation as an expense in the statements of operations based on their fair values and vesting periods. These charges have been significant in the past and we expect that they will increase as our stock price increases, as we acquire more companies, as we hire more employees and seek to retain existing employees. During fiscal 2018 , we recognized stock-based expense related to our equity plans for employees and non-employee directors of $997.0 million . As of January 31, 2018 , the aggregate stock compensation remaining to be amortized to costs and expenses was approximately $1.8 billion . We expect this stock compensation balance to be amortized as follows: $855.4 million during fiscal 2019 ; $582.7 million during fiscal 2020 ; $318.1 million during fiscal 2021 ; $59.5 million during fiscal 2022 ; $17.2 million during fiscal 2023 and $8.0 million thereafter. The expected amortization reflects only outstanding stock awards as of January 31, 2018 and assumes no forfeiture activity. We expect to continue to issue stock-based awards to our employees in future periods. In prior years, we had our annual equity grant cycle for employees in the month of November. During fiscal 2018, we changed our annual equity grant to occur in the month of March, starting in fiscal 2019. Therefore, the stock-based expense timing for fiscal 2018 is not consistent with prior years. We granted 14.9 million shares under the annual equity grant in fiscal 2017 whereas we did not grant any shares under the annual equity grant cycle in fiscal 2018. Amortization of Purchased Intangibles from Business Combinations and the Purchase of 50 Fremont  Our cost of revenues, operating expenses and other expenses include amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets, such as the amortization of the cost associated with an acquired companys developed technology, trade names and trademarks, customer lists, acquired leases and customer relationships. We expect this expense to fluctuate as we acquire more businesses and intangible assets become fully amortized. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, costs and expenses, and related disclosures. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates and assumptions. Our actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. We believe that of our significant accounting policies, which are described in Note 1 Summary of Business and Significant Accounting Policies to our consolidated financial statements, the following accounting policies involve a greater degree of judgment and complexity. Accordingly, these are the policies we believe are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our consolidated financial condition and results of operations. Revenue Recognition . We derive our revenues from two sources: (1) subscription revenues, which are comprised of subscription fees from customers accessing our enterprise cloud computing services and from customers purchasing additional support beyond the standard support that is included in the basic subscription fee; and (2) related professional services such as process mapping, project management, implementation services and other revenue. Other revenue consists primarily of training fees. We commence revenue recognition when all of the following conditions are satisfied: ##TABLE_START  there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  the service has been or is being provided to the customer; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  the collection of the fees is reasonably assured; and ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  the amount of fees to be paid by the customer is fixed or determinable. ##TABLE_END Our subscription service arrangements are non-cancelable and do not contain refund-type provisions. Subscription and Support Revenues Subscription and support revenues are recognized ratably over the contract terms beginning on the commencement date of each contract, which is the date our service is made available to customers. Amounts that have been invoiced are recorded in accounts receivable and in deferred revenue or revenue, depending on whether the revenue recognition criteria have been met. Professional Services and Other Revenues Our professional services contracts are either on a time and materials, fixed-fee or subscription basis. As discussed below, these revenues are recognized as the services are rendered for time and materials contracts, and when the milestones are achieved and accepted by the customer or on a proportional performance basis for fixed price contracts and ratably over the contract term for subscription professional services. The milestone method for revenue recognition is used when there is substantive uncertainty at the date the contract is entered into whether the milestone will be achieved. Training revenues are recognized after the services are performed. Multiple Deliverable Arrangements We enter into arrangements with multiple deliverables that generally include multiple subscriptions, premium support, and professional services. If the deliverables have standalone value at contract inception, we account for each deliverable separately. Subscription services have standalone value as such services are often sold separately. In determining whether professional services have standalone value, we consider the following factors for each professional services agreement: availability of the services from other vendors, the nature of the professional services, the timing of when the professional services contract was signed in comparison to the subscription service start date, and the contractual dependence of the subscription service on the customers satisfaction with the professional services work. To date, we have concluded that all of the professional services included in multiple deliverable arrangements executed have standalone value. Multiple deliverables included in an arrangement are separated into different units of accounting and the arrangement consideration is allocated to the identified separate units based on a relative selling price hierarchy. We determine the relative selling price for a deliverable based on its vendor-specific objective evidence of selling price (VSOE), if available, or our best estimate of selling price (BESP), if VSOE is not available. We have determined that third-party evidence (TPE) is not a practical alternative due to differences in our service offerings compared to other parties and the availability of relevant third-party pricing information. The amount of revenue allocated to delivered items is limited by contingent revenue, if any. For certain professional services, we have established VSOE as a consistent number of standalone sales of this deliverable have been priced within a reasonably narrow range. We have not established VSOE for our subscription services due to lack of pricing consistency, the introduction of new services and other factors. Accordingly, we use our BESP to determine the relative selling price. We determined BESP by considering our overall pricing objectives and market conditions. Significant pricing practices taken into consideration include our discounting practices, the size and volume of our transactions, the customer demographic, the geographic area where our services are sold, our price lists, our go-to-market strategy, historical standalone sales and contract prices. The determination of BESP is made through consultation with and approval by management, taking into consideration the go-to-market strategy. As our go-to-market strategies evolve, we may modify our pricing practices in the future, which could result in changes in relative selling prices, including both VSOE and BESP. Deferred Revenue. The deferred revenue balance does not represent the total contract value of annual or multi-year, non-cancelable subscription agreements. Deferred revenue primarily consists of billings or payments received in advance of revenue recognition from subscription services described above and is recognized as the revenue recognition criteria are met. We generally invoice customers in annual installments. The deferred revenue balance is influenced by several factors, including seasonality, the compounding effects of renewals, invoice duration, invoice timing, dollar size and new business linearity within the quarter. Deferred Commissions. We defer commission payments to our direct sales force. The commissions are deferred and amortized to sales expense over the non-cancelable terms of the related subscription contracts with our customers, which are typically 12 to 36 months. The commission payments, which are paid in full the month after the customers service commences, are a direct and incremental cost of the revenue arrangements. The deferred commission amounts are recoverable through the future revenue streams under the non-cancelable customer contracts. We believe this is the preferable method of accounting as the commission charges are so closely related to the revenue from the non-cancelable customer contracts that they should be recorded as an asset and charged to expense over the same period that the subscription revenue is recognized. During fiscal 2018 , we deferred $799.3 million of commission expenditures and we amortized $464.7 million to sales expense. During fiscal 2017 , we deferred $462.0 million of commission expenditures and we amortized $371.5 million to sales expense. Deferred commissions on our consolidated balance sheets totaled $874.3 million at January 31, 2018 and $539.6 million at January 31, 2017 . Capitalized Internal-Use Software Costs . We are required to follow the guidance of Accounting Standards Codification 350 (ASC 350), Intangibles- Goodwill and Other in accounting for the cost of computer software developed for internal-use and the accounting for web-based product development costs. ASC 350 requires companies to capitalize qualifying computer software costs, which are incurred during the application development stage, and amortize these costs on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the respective asset. We deliver our enterprise cloud computing solutions as a service via all the major Internet browsers and on leading major mobile device operating systems. As a result of this software as a service delivery model, we believe we have larger capitalized costs as compared to traditional enterprise software companies as they are required to use a different accounting standard. Costs related to preliminary project activities and post implementation activities are expensed as incurred. Internal-use software is amortized on a straight-line basis over its estimated useful life. We evaluate the useful lives of these assets on an annual basis and test for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances occur that could impact the recoverability of these assets. Stock-Based Expense. We recognize stock-based expenses related to stock options and restricted stock awards on a straight-line basis, net of estimated forfeitures, over the requisite service period of the awards, which is generally the vesting term of four years. We recognize stock-based expenses related to shares issued pursuant to our 2004 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (ESPP) on a straight-line basis over the offering period, which is 12 months. Stock-based expenses related to performance share grants are measured based on grant date fair value and expensed on a straight-line basis over the service period of the awards, which is generally the vesting term of three years. We, at times, grant unvested restricted shares to employee stockholders of certain acquired companies in lieu of cash consideration. These awards are generally subject to continued post-acquisition employment, and as a result, we have accounted for them as post-acquisition stock-based expense. We recognize stock-based expenses equal to the grant date fair value of the restricted stock awards on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period of the awards. Business Combinations. Accounting for business combinations requires us to make significant estimates and assumptions, especially at the acquisition date with respect to tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed and pre-acquisition contingencies. We use our best estimates and assumptions to accurately assign fair value to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date. Examples of critical estimates in valuing certain of the intangible assets and goodwill we have acquired include but are not limited to: ##TABLE_START  future expected cash flows from subscription and support contracts, professional services contracts, other customer contracts and acquired developed technologies and patents; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  the acquired companys trade name, trademark and existing customer relationship, as well as assumptions about the period of time the acquired trade name and trademark will continue to be used in our offerings; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  uncertain tax positions and tax related valuation allowances assumed; and ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  discount rates. ##TABLE_END Unanticipated events and circumstances may occur that may affect the accuracy or validity of such assumptions, estimates or actual results. In the event that we acquire an entity in which we previously held a strategic investment, the difference between the fair value of the shares as of the date of the acquisition and the carrying value of the strategic investment is recorded as a gain or loss and disclosed separately within the statements of operations. Goodwill and Intangibles. We make estimates, assumptions, and judgments when valuing goodwill and other intangible assets in connection with the initial purchase price allocation of an acquired entity, as well as when evaluating the recoverability of our goodwill and other intangible assets on an ongoing basis. These estimates are based upon a number of factors, including historical experience, market conditions, and information obtained from the management of acquired companies. Critical estimates in valuing certain intangible assets include, but are not limited to, historical and projected attrition rates, discount rates, anticipated growth in revenue from the acquired customers and acquired technology, and the expected use of the acquired assets. These factors are also considered in determining the useful life of acquired intangible assets. The amounts and useful lives assigned to identified intangible assets impact the amount and timing of future amortization expense. Income Taxes. We use the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on temporary differences between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in the consolidated statements of operations in the period that includes the enactment date. Our tax positions are subject to income tax audits by multiple tax jurisdictions throughout the world. We recognize the tax benefit of an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the position is sustainable upon examination by the taxing authority, based on the technical merits. The tax benefit recognized is measured as the largest amount of benefit which is greater than 50 percent likely to be realized upon settlement with the taxing authority. We recognize interest accrued and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in our income tax provision. Valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amounts that are more likely than not expected to be realized based on the weighting of positive and negative evidence. Future realization of deferred tax assets ultimately depends on the existence of sufficient taxable income of the appropriate character (for example, ordinary income or capital gain) within the carryback or carryforward periods available under the applicable tax law. We regularly review the deferred tax assets for recoverability based on historical taxable income, projected future taxable income, the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences and tax planning strategies. Our judgment regarding future profitability may change due to many factors, including future market conditions and the ability to successfully execute our business plans and/or tax planning strategies. Should there be a change in our ability to realize deferred tax assets, our income tax provision would increase or decrease in the period in which the assessment is changed. In December 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (\"Tax Act\") was enacted into law, significantly changing income tax law that affects U.S corporations. Key changes included a corporate tax rate reduction from 35 percent to 21 percent effective January 1, 2018, expensing of certain qualified property, significant changes to the U.S international tax system such as a one-time transition tax on accumulated foreign earnings, and how foreign earnings are subject to U.S. tax. We are required to recognize the effects of the tax law changes in the period of enactment, including the determination of the transition tax and the re-measurement of deferred taxes as well as to re-assess the realizability of our deferred tax assets. Subsequent to the enactment of the Tax Act, the SEC staff issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118, Income Tax Accounting Implications of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (\"SAB 118\"), which allows companies to record provisional amounts related to the effects of the Tax Act during a measurement period not to extend beyond one year of the enactment date. Due to the timing of the Tax Act and additional guidance and interpretations that may be issued by the U.S. Treasury Department, IRS and other standard-setting bodies in the future, we have not completed our analysis of the income tax effects of the Tax Act. Our provisional estimates will be adjusted during the measurement period defined under SAB 118, based upon our ongoing analysis of our data and tax positions along with the new guidance from regulators and interpretations of the law. Strategic Investments. We hold strategic investments in marketable equity securities and non-marketable debt and equity securities in which we do not have a controlling interest or significant influence, as defined in Accounting Standards Codification 323 (ASC 323), Investments - Equity Method and Joint Ventures. Marketable equity securities and non-marketable debt securities, which consist of debt investments in privately held companies, are recorded at fair value with changes in fair value recorded through accumulated other comprehensive income. Equity investments without readily determinable fair values for which the Company does not have the ability to exercise significant influence are accounted for using the cost method of accounting. If, based on the terms of our ownership of these marketable and non-marketable securities, we determine that we exercise significant influence on the entity to which these marketable and non-marketable securities relate, we apply the equity method of accounting for such investments. We determine the fair value of our marketable equity securities and non-marketable debt and equity securities quarterly for impairment and disclosure purposes; however, the non-marketable debt and equity securities are recorded at fair value only if an impairment is recognized. The measurement of fair value requires significant judgment and includes a qualitative and quantitative analysis of events and circumstances that impact the fair value of the investment. Our assessment of the severity and duration of the impairment and qualitative and quantitative analysis includes the investees financial metrics, the investees products and technologies meeting or exceeding predefined milestones, market acceptance of the product or technology, other competitive products or technology in the market, general market conditions, management and governance structure of the investee, investees liquidity, debt ratios and the rate at which the investee is using its cash, and investees receipt of additional funding at a lower valuation. In determining the estimated fair value of our strategic investments in privately held companies, we utilize the most recent data available to us. Valuations of privately held companies are inherently complex due to the lack of readily available market data. If the fair value of an investment is below our cost, we determine whether the investment is other-than-temporarily impaired based on our qualitative and quantitative analysis, which includes the severity and duration of the impairment. If the investment is considered to be other-than-temporarily impaired, we record the investment at fair value by recognizing an impairment through the income statement and establishing a new cost basis for the investment.

Subscription and support revenues were $9.7 billion , or 93 percent of total revenues, for fiscal 2018 , compared to $7.8 billion , or 92 percent of total revenues, during the same period a year ago, an increase of $2.0 billion , or 25 percent . The increase in subscription and support revenues was primarily caused by volume-driven increases from new business, which includes new customers, upgrades and additional subscriptions from existing customers. Our acquisition of Demandware in July 2016 contributed $287.7 million to total revenues in fiscal 2018 as compared to $120.4 million from the date of acquisition to January 31, 2017 . This was offset by a reduction in subscription revenues of approximately $20.0 million as a result of one less day in fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017 . We continue to invest in a variety of customer programs and initiatives which, along with increasing enterprise adoption, have helped keep our attrition rate consistent as compared to the prior year. Consistent attrition rates play a role in our ability to maintain growth in our subscription and support revenues. Changes in the net price per user per month have not been a significant driver of revenue growth for the periods presented. Professional services and other revenues were $769.5 million , or seven percent of total revenues, for fiscal 2018 , compared to $635.8 million , or eight percent of total revenues, for the same period a year ago, an increase of $133.7 million , or 21 percent . The increase in professional services and other revenues was due primarily to the higher demand for services from an increased number of customers. Revenues by geography were as follows (in thousands): ##TABLE_START  Fiscal Year Ended January 31,   As a % of Total Revenues   As a % of Total Revenues Americas $ 7,579,116  %  $ 6,224,971  % Europe 1,903,524   1,373,547  Asia Pacific 997,372   793,466   $ 10,480,012  %  $ 8,391,984  % ##TABLE_ENDRevenues by geography are determined based on the region of the Salesforce contracting entity, which may be different than the region of the customer. Americas revenue attributed to the United States was approximately 96 percent and 96 percent during fiscal 2018 and 2017 , respectively. Revenues in Europe and Asia Pacific accounted for $2.9 billion , or 28 percent of total revenues, for fiscal 2018 , compared to $2.2 billion , or 26 percent of total revenues, during the same period a year ago, an increase of $0.7 billion , or 34 percent . The increase in revenues outside of the Americas was the result of the increasing acceptance of our services, our focus on marketing our services internationally and additional resources. Revenues outside of the Americas increased on a total dollar basis by $97.3 million in fiscal 2018 compared to the same period a year ago as a result of the strengthening British Pound Sterling.

The increase in absolute dollars was primarily due to an increase of $191.5 million in employee-related costs, an increase of $22.5 million in stock-based expenses, an increase of $196.9 million in service delivery costs, primarily due to our efforts to increase data center capacity, an increase of amortization of purchased intangible assets of $37.9 million and an increase of $23.2 million in allocated overhead. We have increased our headcount by 11 percent since January 31, 2017 to meet the higher demand for services from our customers and as a result of our fiscal 2017 acquisitions. We intend to continue to invest additional resources in our enterprise cloud computing services and data center capacity to allow us to scale with our customers and continuously evolve our security measures. We also plan to add additional employees in our professional services group to facilitate the adoption of our services. The timing of these expenses will affect our cost of revenues, both in terms of absolute dollars and as a percentage of revenues in future periods. The cost of professional services and other revenues was $740.1 million during fiscal 2018 resulting in positive gross margin of $29.4 million . The cost of professional services and other revenues was $616.7 million during fiscal 2017 resulting in positive gross margins of $19.1 million . We expect the cost of professional services to be approximately in line with revenues from professional services in future fiscal quarters. We believe that this investment in professional services facilitates the adoption of our service offerings.

The increase in absolute dollars was primarily due to an increase of approximately $211.5 million in employee-related costs, an increase of $72.4 million in stock-based expenses, an increase in our development and test data center costs and allocated overhead. We increased our research and development headcount by 11 percent since January 31, 2017 in order to improve and extend our service offerings, develop new technologies and integrate previously acquired companies, including our fiscal 2017 acquisitions. We expect that research and development expenses will increase in absolute dollars and may increase as a percentage of revenues in future periods as we continue to invest in additional employees and technology to support the development of new, and improve existing, technologies and the integration of acquired technologies. Marketing and sales expenses were $4.8 billion , or 46 percent of total revenues, for fiscal 2018 , compared to $3.9 billion , or 47 percent of total revenues, during the same period a year ago, an increase of $911.3 million . The change was primarily due to an increase of $719.8 million in employee-related costs and amortization of deferred commissions, an increase of $79.6 million in stock-based expenses, an increase in amortization of purchased intangible assets of $23.7 million , and allocated overhead. Our marketing and sales headcount increased by 22 percent since January 31, 2017 . The increase in headcount was primarily attributable to hiring additional sales personnel to focus on adding new customers and increasing penetration within our existing customer base. General and administrative expenses were $1.1 billion , or 10 percent of total revenues, for fiscal 2018 , compared to $1.0 billion , or 11 percent of total revenues, during the same period a year ago, an increase of $120.8 million . The increase was primarily due to an increase in employee-related costs. Our general and administrative headcount increased by 16 percent since January 31, 2017 as we added personnel to support our growth.

The increase was due to higher interest income across our portfolio. Interest expense consists of interest on our convertible senior notes, capital leases, financing obligation related to 350 Mission, the loan assumed on 50 Fremont, revolving credit facility and the $500.0 million term loan that was entered into in connection with our acquisition of Demandware. Interest expense was $86.9 million for fiscal 2018 and was $89.0 million during the same period a year ago. Other income (expense) primarily consists of non-operating transactions such as strategic investment realized gains and losses and other-than-temporary impairments, gains and losses from foreign exchange rate fluctuations and real estate transactions. The Company sold a portion of its publicly-held investments in fiscal 2018, which resulted in a reclassification of previously unrealized gains from the accumulated other comprehensive loss on the balance sheet to other income (expense) in the amount of $58.6 million . This amount was offset by other-than-temporary impairments on strategic investments. Gains from acquisitions of strategic investments represents gains recognized related to strategic investments when we acquire an entity in which we previously held a strategic investment. The difference between the fair value of the shares as of the date of the acquisition and the carrying value of the strategic investment is recorded as a gain or loss and disclosed separately within the statements of operations. Benefit from (provision for) income taxes . ##TABLE_START  Fiscal Year Ended January 31,  Variance Dollars (in thousands)   Benefit from (provision for) income taxes $ (74,630 )  $ 154,249  $ (228,879 ) Effective tax rate %  (608 )%   ##TABLE_ENDWe recognized a tax provision of $74.6 million on a pretax income of $202.1 million for fiscal 2018 . The tax provision recorded was primarily related to income taxes in profitable jurisdictions outside of the United States. In fiscal 2017, we recorded a tax benefit of $154.2 million on a pretax income of $25.4 million for fiscal 2017 . The most significant component of this tax amount was the discrete tax benefit of $210.3 million from a partial release of the valuation allowance in connection with the acquisition of Demandware. The net deferred tax liability from the acquisition of Demandware provided a source of additional income to support the realizability of our preexisting deferred tax assets and, as a result, we released a portion of our valuation allowance. The tax benefit associated with the release of the valuation allowance was partially offset by income taxes in profitable jurisdictions outside of the United States.

Subscription and support revenues were $7.8 billion, or 92 percent of total revenues, for fiscal 2017, compared to $6.2 billion, or 93 percent of total revenues, for fiscal 2016, an increase of $1.6 billion, or 25 percent. The increase in subscription and support revenues in fiscal 2017 was primarily caused by volume-driven increases from new business, which includes new customers, upgrades and additional subscriptions from existing customers. Revenue resulting from our July 2016 acquisition of Demandware contributed $120.4 million to total revenues for fiscal 2017. Revenues from other acquired businesses in fiscal 2017 were not material. We continued to invest in a variety of customer programs and initiatives, which, along with increasing enterprise adoption, have helped keep our attrition rate consistent as compared to fiscal 2016. Our attrition rate also played a role in the increase in subscription and support revenues. Changes in our pricing have not been a significant driver of revenue growth for the periods presented. Professional services and other revenues were $635.8 million, or eight percent of total revenues, for fiscal 2017, compared to $461.6 million, or seven percent of total revenues, for fiscal 2016, an increase of $174.2 million, or 38 percent. The increase was primarily due to the growth in our subscription professional services. Revenues by geography were as follows (in thousands): ##TABLE_START  Fiscal Year Ended January 31,   As a % of Total Revenues   As a % of Total Revenues Americas $ 6,224,971  %  $ 4,910,745  % Europe 1,373,547   1,162,808  Asia Pacific 793,466   593,663   $ 8,391,984  %  $ 6,667,216  % ##TABLE_ENDRevenues in Europe and Asia Pacific accounted for $2.2 billion, or 26 percent of total revenues, for fiscal 2017, compared to $1.8 billion, or 26 percent of total revenues, for fiscal 2016, an increase of $410.5 million, or 23 percent. The increase in revenues on a total dollar basis outside of the Americas was the result of the increasing acceptance of our service, our focus on marketing our services internationally, additional resources and consistent attrition rates as a result of the reasons stated above. Revenues outside of the Americas increased on a total dollar basis in fiscal 2017 despite an overall strengthening of the U.S. dollar, which reduced aggregate international revenues by $103.8 million compared to fiscal 2016. Americas revenue attributed to the United States was approximately 96 percent and 95 percent for fiscal 2017 and 2016, respectively. No other country represented more than ten percent of total revenue during fiscal 2017 or 2016.

The increase in absolute dollars was primarily due to an increase of $240.9 million in employee-related costs, an increase of $38.0 million in stock-based expenses, an increase of $162.4 million in service delivery costs, primarily due to our efforts to increase data center capacity, an increase of $23.5 million in professional and outside services, an increase of amortization of purchased intangibles of $46.8 million, an increase in depreciation of equipment of $16.2 million and an increase in allocated overhead of $35.9 million. We increased our headcount by 34 percent in fiscal 2017 to meet the higher demand for services from our customers and as a result of our fiscal 2017 acquisitions. The cost of professional services and other revenues was $616.7 million during fiscal 2017 resulting in positive gross margin of $19.1 million.

The increase in absolute dollars was primarily due to an increase of $173.2 million in employee-related costs, an increase of $58.1 million in stock-based expense, an increase of $28.1 million in development and test data center expense, and an increase in allocated overhead. We increased our research and development headcount by 35 percent in fiscal 2017 in order to improve and extend our service offerings and develop new technologies as a result of our fiscal 2017 acquisitions. Marketing and sales expenses were $3.9 billion, or 47 percent of total revenues, for fiscal 2017, compared to $3.2 billion, or 49 percent of total revenues, for fiscal 2016, an increase of $678.2 million. The increase in absolute dollars was primarily due to increases of $484.3 million in employee-related costs, including amortization of deferred commissions, $34.7 million in advertising expense, $20.4 million in amortization of purchased intangibles, $99.8 million stock-based expense and $36.5 million in allocated overhead. Our marketing and sales headcount increased by 24 percent in fiscal 2017. The increase in headcount was also attributable to hiring additional sales personnel to focus on adding new customers and increasing penetration within our existing customer base. General and administrative expenses were $967.6 million, or 11 percent of total revenues, for fiscal 2017, compared to $748.2 million, or 11 percent of total revenues, for fiscal 2016, an increase of $219.3 million. The increase was primarily due to an increase of $175.2 million in employee-related costs, an increase of $30.9 million in stock-based expense and an increase in professional and outside services. Our general and administrative headcount increased by 22 percent in fiscal 2017 as we added personnel to support our growth. In connection with the purchase of 50 Fremont, we recognized a net non-cash gain in fiscal 2016 totaling approximately $36.6 million on the termination of the lease signed in January 2012.

Investment income was $27.4 million for fiscal 2017 and was $15.3 million for fiscal 2016. The increase was due to both realized gains resulting from the sales of marketable securities as well as higher interest income across our portfolio. Interest expense consists of interest on our convertible senior notes, capital leases, financing obligation related to 350 Mission, the loan assumed on 50 Fremont, revolving credit facility and the $500.0 million term loan that was entered into in connection with our acquisition of Demandware. Interest expense was $89.0 million for fiscal 2017 and was $72.5 million for fiscal 2016. The increase was primarily due to the term loan in fiscal 2017 associated with the Demandware purchase and our outstanding balance in our revolving facility in in fiscal 2017. Other income (expense) primarily consists of non-operating transactions such as strategic investments fair market value adjustments, gains and losses from foreign exchange rate fluctuations and real estate transactions. Gain on sales of land and building improvements consists of the gain the company recognized from sales of undeveloped real estate and a portion of associated perpetual parking rights in San Francisco, California. Gain on sales of land and building improvements, net of closing costs, was $21.8 million during fiscal 2016. Gains from acquisitions of strategic investments represents gains on sales of strategic investments when we acquire an entity in which we previously held a strategic investment. The difference between the fair value of the shares as of the date of the acquisition and the carrying value of the strategic investment is recorded as a gain or loss and disclosed separately within the statements of operations. Benefit from (provision for) income taxes. ##TABLE_START  Fiscal Year Ended January 31,  Variance Dollars (in thousands)   Benefit from (provision for) income taxes $ 154,249  $ (111,705 )  $ 265,954 Effective tax rate (608 )%  %   ##TABLE_ENDWe reported a tax benefit of $154.2 million on a pretax income of $25.4 million, which resulted in a negative effective tax rate of 608 percent for fiscal 2017. The most significant component of this tax amount was the tax benefit of $210.3 million from a partial release of the valuation allowance in connection with the acquisition of Demandware. The net deferred tax liability from the acquisition of Demandware provided a source of additional income to support the realizability of our preexisting deferred tax assets and as a result, we released a portion of our tax valuation allowance. The tax benefit associated with the release of the valuation allowance was partially offset by income taxes in profitable jurisdictions outside the United States. Additionally, as a result of early adopting Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-09, Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Shared-Based Payment Accounting (ASU 2016-09) and our valuation allowance position, we did not record significant U.S. current income tax expense. We recorded a tax provision of $111.7 million with a pretax income of $64.3 million, which resulted in an effective tax rate of 174 percent for fiscal 2016. We had a tax provision in profitable jurisdictions outside the United States and current tax expense in the United States. We had U.S. current tax expense as a result of taxable income before considering certain excess tax benefits from stock options and vesting of restricted stock. Liquidity and Capital Resources At January 31, 2018 , our principal sources of liquidity were cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaling $4.5 billion and accounts receivable of $3.9 billion . Our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities are comprised primarily of corporate notes and obligations, U.S. treasury securities, asset backed securities, foreign government obligations, mortgage backed obligations, time deposits, money market mutual funds and municipal securities. Net cash provided by operating activities was $2.7 billion during fiscal 2018 and $2.2 billion during the same period a year ago. Net cash provided by operating activities was $2.2 billion during fiscal 2017 and $1.7 billion during fiscal 2016 . Cash provided by operating activities has historically been affected by the amount of net income adjusted for non-cash expense items such as depreciation and amortization; amortization of purchased intangibles from business combinations; amortization of debt discount; the expense associated with stock-based awards; gains on sales of strategic investments; the timing of employee related costs including commissions and bonus payments; the timing of payments against accounts payable, accrued expenses and other current liabilities; the timing of collections from our customers, which is our largest source of operating cash flows; the timing of business combination activity and the related integration and transaction costs; and changes in working capital accounts. Our working capital accounts consist of accounts receivable, deferred commissions, prepaid assets and other current assets. Claims against working capital include accounts payable, accrued expenses, deferred revenue, and other current liabilities and payments related to our debt obligations. Our working capital may be impacted by factors in future periods such as billings to customers for subscriptions and support services and the subsequent collection of those billings, certain amounts and timing of which are seasonal. Our working capital in some quarters may be impacted by adverse foreign currency exchange rate movements and this impact may increase as our working capital balances increase in our foreign subsidiaries. Our billings are also influenced by new business linearity within the quarters and across quarters. As described above in Seasonal Nature of Deferred Revenue, Accounts Receivable and Operating Cash Flow, our fourth quarter has historically been our strongest quarter for new business and renewals and, correspondingly, the first quarter has historically been the strongest for cash collections. The year on year compounding effect of this seasonality in both billing patterns and overall business causes both the value of invoices that we generate in the fourth quarter and cash collections in the first quarter to increase as a proportion of our total annual billings. We generally invoice our customers for our subscription and services contracts in advance in annual installments. We typically issue renewal invoices in advance of the renewal service period, and depending on timing, the initial invoice for the subscription and services contract and the subsequent renewal invoice may occur in different quarters. Such invoice amounts are initially reflected in accounts receivable and deferred revenue, which is reflected on the balance sheets, and as the contract renewal approaches, the corresponding deferred revenue decreases to zero. The operating cash flow benefit of increased billing activity generally occurs in the subsequent quarter when we collect from our customers. As such, our first quarter is our largest collections and operating cash flow quarter. Net cash used in investing activities was $2.0 billion during fiscal 2018 and $2.7 billion during the same period a year ago. The net cash used in investing activities during fiscal 2018 primarily related to purchases of marketable securities of $2.0 billion and new office build outs and capital investments of $534.0 million , which were offset by the cash inflows for the period from the sales of marketable securities of $558.6 million . Net cash used in investing activities was $2.7 billion during fiscal 2017 and $1.5 billion during fiscal 2016 . The net cash used in investing activities during fiscal 2017 primarily related to business combinations with the largest being the acquisition of Demandware in July 2016, purchases of marketable securities of approximately $1.1 billion , new office build-outs and strategic and capital investments, which were offset by the cash inflows for the period from sales and maturities of marketable securities of $2.0 billion . Net cash used in investing activities was $1.5 billion during fiscal 2016 , which primarily related to capital expenditures, strategic investments, business combinations, the purchase of 50 Fremont land and building, new office build-outs, investment of cash balances offset by proceeds from sales and maturities of marketable securities and proceeds from the sale of Mission Bay land and the use of restricted cash to purchase 50 Fremont land and building. Net cash provided by financing activities was $221.2 million during fiscal 2018 as compared to $997.7 million during the same period a year ago. Net cash provided by financing activities during fiscal 2018 consisted primarily of $650.3 million from proceeds from equity plans offset by $200.0 million repayment of the revolving credit facility, $123.2 million of principal payments on conversions of the 0.25% Senior Notes and $105.9 million of principal payments on capital lease obligations. Net cash provided by financing activities was $997.7 million during fiscal 2017 as compared to net cash provided by financing activities of $73.2 million during fiscal 2016 . Net cash provided by financing activities during fiscal 2017 consisted primarily of $748.8 million proceeds from borrowings under our revolving credit facility, $495.6 million of proceeds from the Term Loan, net of loan fees, $401.5 million from proceeds from equity plans offset by $98.2 million of principal payments on capital leases and $550.0 million payment of our revolving credit facility. Net cash provided by financing activities during fiscal 2016 consisted primarily of $455.5 million from proceeds from equity plan offset by $82.3 million of principal payments on capital leases and $300.0 million payment of our revolving credit facility. In March 2013, we issued at par value $1.15 billion of 0.25% convertible senior notes (0.25% Senior Notes), due April 2018, unless earlier purchased by us or converted. The Notes are classified as a current liability on our consolidated balance sheet as of January 31, 2018 as they are due within one year. As of January 31, 2018 the remaining principal balance of the 0.25% Senior Notes outstanding is $1.03 billion . In July 2016, we entered into a credit agreement ( Revolving Loan Credit Agreement ), which provides for a $1.0 billion unsecured revolving credit facility (Credit Facility) that matures in July 2021. We may use any future borrowings under the Credit Facility for refinancing other indebtedness, working capital, capital expenditures and other general corporate purposes, including permitted acquisitions. We may borrow amounts under the Credit Facility at any time during the term of the Revolving Loan Credit Agreement . As of January 31, 2018 , we had no outstanding borrowings under the Credit Facility. We were in compliance with the Revolving Loan Credit Agreement s covenants as of January 31, 2018 . In July 2016, to partially finance the acquisition of Demandware, we entered into a $500.0 million term loan (Term Loan) which matures in July 2019. As of January 31, 2018 , the noncurrent outstanding principal portion of the Term Loan was $500.0 million . All outstanding amounts under the Term Loan Credit Agreement will be due and payable in July 2019. The Company may prepay the Term Loan, in whole or in part, at any time without premium or penalty, subject to certain conditions, and amounts repaid or prepaid may not be reborrowed. The Companys obligations under the Term Loan Credit Agreement are required to be guaranteed by certain of its subsidiaries meeting certain thresholds set forth in the Term Loan Credit Agreement. The Company was in compliance with the Term Loan Credit Agreements covenants as of January 31, 2018 . As of January 31, 2018 , we have a total of $99.9 million in letters of credit outstanding in favor of certain landlords for office space. To date, no amounts have been drawn against the letters of credit, which renew annually and expire at various dates through December 2030. We do not have any special purpose entities, and other than operating leases for office space and computer equipment, we do not engage in off-balance sheet financing arrangements. Our principal commitments consist of obligations under leases for office space, co-location data center facilities and our development and test data center, as well as leases for computer equipment, software, furniture and fixtures. At January 31, 2018 , the future non-cancelable minimum payments under these commitments were as follows (in thousands): ##TABLE_START Contractual Obligations Payments Due by Period  Total  Less than 1 Year  1-3 Years  3-5 Years  More than 5 Years Capital lease obligations, including interest $ 317,645  $ 115,909  $ 201,695  $  $ Operating lease obligations:          Facilities space 2,727,369  335,289  660,807  575,673  1,155,600 Computer equipment and furniture and fixtures 555,958  275,636  280,322   0.25% Convertible Senior Notes 1,026,821  1,026,821    Loan assumed on 50 Fremont 200,000  2,128  7,661  8,257  181,954 Term loan 500,000   500,000   Financing obligation - leased facility 300,903  21,881  45,095  46,872  187,055 Contractual commitments 513,831  185,449  229,132  53,500  45,750  $ 6,142,527  $ 1,963,113  $ 1,924,712  $ 684,343  $ 1,570,359 ##TABLE_ENDThe majority of our operating lease agreements provide us with the option to renew. Our future operating lease obligations would change if we exercised these options and if we entered into additional operating lease agreements as we expand our operations. The financing obligation - leased facility above represents the total obligation for our lease of approximately 445,000 rentable square feet of office space at 350 Mission St. (\"350 Mission\") in San Francisco, California. As of January 31, 2018 , $218.2 million of the total obligation noted above was recorded to Financing obligation - leased facility, of which the current portion is included in Accounts payable, accrued expenses and other liabilities and the noncurrent portion is included in Other noncurrent liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets. Purchase orders are not included in the table above. Our purchase orders represent authorizations to purchase rather than binding agreements. The contractual commitment amounts in the table above are associated with agreements that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms, including: fixed or minimum services to be used; fixed, minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. Obligations under contracts that we can cancel without a significant penalty are not included in the table above. In April 2016, we entered into an agreement with a third-party provider for certain infrastructure services for a period of four years. We paid $96.0 million in connection with this agreement during fiscal 2018 . The agreement further provides that we will pay an additional $108.0 million in fiscal 2019 and $126.0 million in fiscal 2020. This agreement is included in the table above under contractual commitments. In July 2017, we entered into an agreement with a third-party to obtain the exclusive naming rights for the Salesforce Transit Center project in San Francisco for a period of 25 years. We paid a non-refundable fee of $1.0 million upon execution of the agreement and we are obligated to pay approximately $4.4 million each year over the life of the agreement. The agreement may be terminated by us without cause upon satisfaction of certain conditions and is therefore excluded from the table above. During fiscal 2018 and in future fiscal years, we have made and expect to continue to make additional investments in our infrastructure to scale our operations and increase productivity. We plan to upgrade or replace various internal systems to scale with the overall growth of the Company. Additionally, we expect capital expenditures to be higher in absolute dollars and remain consistent as a percentage of total revenues in future periods as a result of continued office build-outs, other leasehold improvements and data center investments. In the future, we may enter into arrangements to acquire or invest in complementary businesses, services and technologies, and intellectual property rights. To facilitate these acquisitions or investments, we may seek additional equity or debt financing, which may not be available on terms favorable to us or at all, which may affect our ability to complete subsequent acquisitions or investments, and which may affect the risks of owning our common stock. We believe our existing cash, cash equivalents, marketable securities, cash provided by operating activities and, if necessary, our borrowing capacity under our Credit Facility will be sufficient to meet our working capital, capital expenditure and debt repayment needs over the next 12 months. We expect our cash tax payments for the next 12 months, primarily from profitable jurisdictions outside of the U.S, to be consistent with those paid in prior years. Additionally, the one-time transition tax under the Tax Act will not have an impact on our cash taxes based on our provisional assessment. New Accounting Pronouncements See Note 1 Summary of Business and Significant Accounting Policies to the consolidated financial statements for our discussion about new accounting pronouncements adopted and those pending. Other Information Environmental, Social and Governance We believe the business of business is improving the state of the world for all of our stakeholders, including our stockholders, customers, employees, community, environment and society. We are committed to creating a sustainable, low-carbon future by delivering a carbon neutral cloud, operating as a net-zero greenhouse gas emissions company and by working to achieve our goal of 100 percent renewable energy for our global operations. In addition, we have spearheaded initiatives to drive equality in four key areas: equal rights, equal pay, equal education and equal opportunity. We also pioneered and have inspired other companies to adopt our 1-1-1 integrated philanthropy model, which leverages 1 percent of a companys equity, employee time and product to help improve communities around the world. Together with the Salesforce Foundation, a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization, and Salesforce.org, a nonprofit social enterprise, which are not included in our consolidated financial statements, we have given approximately $200 million to charitable organizations, logged more than 2.6 million employee volunteer hours around the world and provided more than 34,000 nonprofit and higher education organizations with the use of our service offerings for free or at a discount. Below are some of the key highlights of our environmental, social and governance efforts: ##TABLE_START  In fiscal 2018 we achieved net-zero greenhouse gas emissions and began delivering a carbon neutral cloud for all customers. In addition, we are committed to working toward 100 percent renewable energy for our global operations. To support this goal, in fiscal 2016, we signed two virtual power purchase agreements in West Virginia and Texas and, in fiscal 2018, we began sourcing 100 percent renewable energy for approximately 90 percent of our urban campus in San Francisco. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  As part of our ongoing work to promote equality in employee pay, opportunity and advancement, in fiscal 2017, we initiated our equal pay assessment and subsequently adjusted our pay practices to eliminate statistically significant gender-associated differences in pay, committing approximately $6 million to this end to date. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  In fiscal 2018, we announced that Salesforce Tower will feature the largest on-site water recycling system in a commercial high-rise building in the United States. The system is expected to reduce the building's water consumption and provide water recycling capabilities for all building tenants. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  We strive to integrate sustainability into our corporate events. For example, at Dreamforce 2017, we offset 100 percent of onsite event greenhouse gas emissions, as well as emissions from employee travel, through carbon credits purchased by us. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  We are active in and support organizations that move the United States and the world toward a more sustainable, low-carbon future.

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK ##TABLE_END Foreign Currency Exchange Risk We primarily conduct our business in the following locations: the United States, Europe, Canada, Asia Pacific and Japan. The expanding global scope of our business exposes us to risk of fluctuations in foreign currency markets. This exposure is the result of selling in multiple currencies, growth in our international investments, including data center expansion, additional headcount in foreign countries, and operating in countries where the functional currency is the local currency. Specifically, our results of operations and cash flows are subject to fluctuations in the following currencies: the Euro, British Pound Sterling, Canadian Dollar, Australian Dollar and Japanese Yen against the United States Dollar (USD). These exposures may change over time as business practices evolve and economic conditions change. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates could have an adverse impact on our financial results and cash flows. Our European revenue, operating expenses and significant balance sheet accounts denominated in currencies other than the USD primarily flow through our United Kingdom subsidiary, which has a functional currency of the British Pound. This results in a two-step currency exchange process wherein the currencies in Europe other than the British Pound are first converted into the British Pound and then British Pounds are translated into USD for our Consolidated Financial Statements. As an example, costs incurred in France are translated from the Euro to the British Pound and then into the USD. Our statements of operations and balance sheet accounts are also impacted by the re-measurement of non-functional currency transactions such as USD denominated intercompany loans, cash accounts held by our overseas subsidiaries, accounts receivable denominated in foreign currencies and deferred revenue and accounts payable denominated in foreign currencies. Foreign Currency Transaction Risk Our foreign currency exposures typically arise from selling annual and multi-year subscriptions in multiple currencies, customer account receivables, intercompany transfer pricing arrangements and other intercompany transactions. Our foreign currency management objective is to minimize the effect of fluctuations in foreign exchange rates on selected assets or liabilities without exposing us to additional risk associated with transactions that could be regarded as speculative. We pursue our objective by utilizing foreign currency forward contracts to offset foreign exchange risk. Our foreign currency forward contracts are generally short-term in duration. We neither use these foreign currency forward contracts for trading purposes nor do we currently designate these forward contracts as hedging instruments pursuant to Accounting Standards Codification 815 (ASC 815), Derivatives and Hedging. Accordingly, we record the fair values of these contracts as of the end of our reporting period to our consolidated balance sheets with changes in fair values recorded to our consolidated statements of operations. Given the short duration of the forward contracts, the amount recorded is not significant. Our ultimate realized gain or loss with respect to foreign currency exposures will generally depend on the size and type of cross-currency transactions that we enter into, the currency exchange rates associated with these exposures and changes in those rates, the net realized gain or loss on our foreign currency forward contracts and other factors. Foreign Currency Translation Risk Fluctuations in foreign currencies impact the amount of total assets, liabilities, revenues, operating expenses and cash flows that we report for our foreign subsidiaries upon the translation of these amounts into USD. As the USD fluctuated against certain international currencies over the past several months, the amounts of revenue and deferred revenue that we reported in USD for foreign subsidiaries that transact in international currencies were higher relative to what we would have reported using a constant currency rate. Interest Rate Sensitivity We had cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaling $4.5 billion at January 31, 2018 . This amount was invested primarily in money market funds, time deposits, corporate notes and bonds, government securities and other debt securities with credit ratings of at least BBB or better. The cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities are held for general corporate purposes including possible acquisitions of, or investments in, complementary businesses, services or technologies, working capital and capital expenditures. Our investments are made for capital preservation purposes. We do not enter into investments for trading or speculative purposes. Our cash equivalents and our portfolio of marketable securities are subject to market risk due to changes in interest rates. Fixed rate securities may have their market value adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates, while floating rate securities may produce less income than expected if interest rates fall. Due in part to these factors, our future investment income may fall short of expectation due to changes in interest rates or we may suffer losses in principal if we are forced to sell securities that decline in market value due to changes in interest rates. However because we classify our debt securities as available for sale, no gains or losses are recognized due to changes in interest rates unless such securities are sold prior to maturity or declines in fair value are determined to be other-than-temporary. Our fixed-income portfolio is subject to interest rate risk. An immediate increase or decrease in interest rates of 100-basis points at January 31, 2018 could result in a $33.5 million market value reduction or increase of the same amount. This estimate is based on a sensitivity model that measures market value changes when changes in interest rates occur. Fluctuations in the value of our investment securities caused by a change in interest rates (gains or losses on the carrying value) are recorded in other comprehensive income, and are realized only if we sell the underlying securities. At January 31, 2017 , we had cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaling $2.2 billion . The fixed-income portfolio was also subject to interest rate risk. Changes in interest rates of 100-basis points would have resulted in market value changes of $13.0 million . Market Risk and Market Interest Risk We deposit our cash with multiple financial institutions. In March 2013, we issued at par value $1.15 billion of 0.25% convertible senior notes (Notes) due in April 2018. Holders of the Notes may convert the Notes prior to maturity upon the occurrence of certain circumstances. Upon conversion, we would pay the holder an amount of cash equal to the principal amounts of the Notes. The amounts in excess of the principal amounts, if any, may be paid in cash or stock at our option. Concurrent with the issuance of the Notes, we entered into separate note hedging transactions and the sale of warrants. These separate transactions were completed to reduce the potential economic dilution from the conversion of the Notes. The Notes have a fixed annual interest rate of 0.25% and therefore, we do not have economic interest rate exposure on the Notes. However, the value of the Notes is exposed to interest rate risk. Generally, the fair value of our fixed interest rate Notes will increase as interest rates fall and decrease as interest rates rise. In addition, the fair value of our Notes is affected by our stock price. The principal balance of our Notes was $1.03 billion as of January 31, 2018 . The total estimated fair value of our Notes at January 31, 2018 was $1.8 billion . The fair value was determined based on the closing trading price per $100 of the Notes as of the last day of trading for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018 , which was $170.95 . In July 2016, we amended our credit agreement ( Revolving Loan Credit Agreement ) to provide for a $1.0 billion unsecured revolving credit facility (Credit Facility) that matures in July 2021. The Borrowings under the Credit Facility bear interest, at our option, at a base rate plus a spread of 0.00% to 0.75% or an adjusted LIBOR rate plus a spread of 1.00% to 1.75% , in each case with such spread being determined based on our consolidated leverage ratio for the preceding four fiscal quarter period. Regardless of what amounts, if any, are outstanding under the revolving credit facility, we are also obligated to pay an ongoing commitment fee on undrawn amounts at a rate of 0.125% to 0.25% , with such rate being based on our consolidated leverage ratio for the preceding four fiscal quarter period, payable in arrears quarterly. As of January 31, 2018 there was no outstanding borrowing amount under the Credit Facility. In February 2015, we assumed a $200.0 million loan with the acquisition of 50 Fremont (Loan). The Loan bears an interest rate of 3.75% per annum and is due in June 2023. For the remainder of fiscal 2018, the Loan requires interest only payments. Beginning in fiscal 2019, principal and interest payments are required, with the remaining principal due at maturity. The Loan can be prepaid at any time subject to a yield maintenance fee. The agreement governing the Loan contains certain customary affirmative and negative covenants that we were in compliance with as of January 31, 2018 . In July 2016, we entered into a $500.0 million term loan (Term Loan) which matures in July 2019 and bears interest at our option, at either a base rate plus a spread of 0.00% to 0.75% or an adjusted LIBOR rate plus a spread of 1.00% to 1.75%, in each case with such spread being determined based on the Companys consolidated leverage ratio for the preceding four fiscal quarter period. We entered into the Term Loan for purposes of partially funding the acquisition of Demandware. Interest is due and payable in arrears quarterly for loans bearing interest at a rate based on the base rate and at the end of an interest period in the case of loans bearing interest at the adjusted LIBOR rate. By entering into the Term Loan, we have assumed risks associated with variable interest rates based upon a variable base rate or LIBOR. The weighted average interest rate on the Term Loan was 2.2% as of January 31, 2018 . Changes in the overall level of interest rates affect the interest expense that we recognize in our statements of operations. The bank counterparties to our derivative contracts potentially expose us to credit-related losses in the event of their nonperformance. To mitigate that risk, we only contract with counterparties who meet the minimum requirements under our counterparty risk assessment process. We monitor ratings, credit spreads and potential downgrades on at least a quarterly basis. Based on our on-going assessment of counterparty risk, we adjust our exposure to various counterparties. We generally enter into master netting arrangements, which reduce credit risk by permitting net settlement of transactions with the same counterparty. However, we do not have any master netting arrangements in place with collateral features. We have an investment portfolio that includes strategic investments in public and privately held companies, which range from early-stage companies to more mature companies with established revenue streams and business models. As of January 31, 2018 , our portfolio consists of investments in over 200 privately held companies and two public companies, primarily comprised of independent software vendors and system integrators. Our investments in these companies range from $0.2 million to over $90.0 million , with 16 investments individually equal to or in excess of approximately $10.0 million as of January 31, 2018 . We invest in early-to-late stage enterprise cloud companies for strategic reasons and to support key business initiatives to grow our ecosystem of partners and accelerate the adoption of cloud technologies. We invest in both domestic and international companies and currently hold investments in all of our regions: the Americas, Europe, and Asia Pacific. We plan to continue to invest in these types of strategic investments, including in companies representing targeted geographies and targeted business and technological initiatives, as opportunities arise that we find attractive The primary purpose of our investments is to create an ecosystem of enterprise cloud companies, accelerate the growth of technology startups and system integrators and create the next generation of mobile applications and connected products. Therefore, we continually evaluate our investments in privately held and publicly traded companies. In certain cases, our ability to sell these investments may be impacted by contractual obligations to hold the securities for a set period of time after a public offering. Currently, one of our publicly held investments is subject to such a contractual obligation, which expires in the first quarter of fiscal 2019. Our strategic investments in privately held companies are primarily in preferred stock of the respective investees and therefore provide us with liquidation preferences in the event there are certain liquidation events. When our ownership interests are less than 20 percent and we do not have the ability to exert significant influence, we account for investments in non-marketable debt at their estimated fair value and equity securities of the privately held companies using the cost method of accounting. Otherwise, we account for the investments using the equity method of accounting. As of January 31, 2018 and January 31, 2017 , the carrying value of our investments in privately held companies was $652.8 million and $526.0 million , respectively. The estimated fair value of our investments in privately held companies was $912.0 million and $758.3 million as of January 31, 2018 and January 31, 2017 , respectively. The financial success of our investment in any company is typically dependent on a liquidity event, such as a public offering, acquisition or other favorable market event reflecting appreciation to the cost of our initial investment. If we determine that any of our investments in such companies have experienced a decline in fair value, we may be required to record an impairment that is other-than-temporary, which could be material. We have in the past recorded other than temporary impairments or written off the full value of specific investments. Similar situations could occur in the future and negatively impact our financial results. All of our investments are subject to a risk of partial or total loss of investment capital. ##TABLE_START ", "8": " ITEM 8.

Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting A companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. ##TABLE_START /s/ Ernst  Young LLP ##TABLE_ENDRedwood City, California March 9, 2018  salesforce.com, inc.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements 1. Summary of Business and Significant Accounting Policies Description of Business Salesforce.com, inc. (the \"Company\") is a leading provider of enterprise software, delivered through the cloud, with a focus on customer relationship management, or CRM. The Company introduced its first CRM solution in 2000, and has since expanded its service offerings into new areas and industries with new editions, features and platform capabilities. The Company's core mission is to empower its customers to connect with their customers in entirely new ways through cloud, mobile, social, Internet of Things (IoT) and artificial intelligence technologies. The Company's Customer Success Platform is a comprehensive portfolio of service offerings providing sales force automation, customer service and support, marketing automation, digital commerce, community management, industry-specific solutions, analytics, application development, IoT integration, collaborative productivity tools, an enterprise cloud marketplace which the Company refers to as the AppExchange, and its professional cloud services. Fiscal Year The Companys fiscal year ends on January 31. References to fiscal 2018 , for example, refer to the fiscal year ending January 31, 2018 . Use of Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (U.S. GAAP\") requires management to make estimates and assumptions in the Companys consolidated financial statements and notes thereto. Significant estimates and assumptions made by management include the determination of: ##TABLE_START  the best estimate of selling price of the deliverables included in multiple deliverable revenue arrangements; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed for business combinations; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  the recognition, measurement and valuation of current and deferred income taxes; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  the fair value of certain stock awards issued; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  the useful lives of intangible assets, property and equipment and building and structural components; and ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  the valuation of strategic investments and the determination of other-than-temporary impairments. ##TABLE_END Actual results could differ materially from those estimates. The Company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable, the result of which forms the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities. Principles of Consolidation The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. Segments The Company operates as one operating segment. Operating segments are defined as components of an enterprise for which separate financial information is evaluated regularly by the chief operating decision maker, who is the chief executive officer, in deciding how to allocate resources and assessing performance. Over the past few years, the Company has completed a number of acquisitions. These acquisitions have allowed the Company to expand its offerings, presence and reach in various market segments of the enterprise cloud computing market. While the Company has offerings in multiple enterprise cloud computing market segments, including as a result of the Company's acquisitions, the Companys business operates in one operating segment because the majority of the Company's offerings operate on a single platform and are deployed in an identical way, and  the Companys chief operating decision maker evaluates the Companys financial information and resources and assesses the performance of these resources on a consolidated basis. Since the Company operates in one operating segment, all required financial segment information can be found in the consolidated financial statements. Concentrations of Credit Risk and Significant Customers The Companys financial instruments that are exposed to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities and accounts receivable. In addition, in connection with the Company's Convertible 0.25% Senior Notes (as defined in Note 8 \"Debt\"), which were issued in March 2013, the Company entered into convertible note hedge transactions with respect to its common stock, which are exposed to concentrations of credit risk. Collateral is not required for accounts receivable or the note hedge transactions. The Company maintains an allowance for its doubtful accounts receivable. This allowance is based upon historical loss patterns, the number of days that billings are past due and an evaluation of the potential risk of loss associated with delinquent accounts. Receivables are written-off and charged against its recorded allowance when the Company has exhausted collection efforts without success. No single customer accounted for more than five percent of accounts receivable at January 31, 2018 and January 31, 2017 . No single customer accounted for five percent or more of total revenue during fiscal 2018 , 2017 and 2016 . Geographic Locations As of January 31, 2018 and 2017 , assets located outside the Americas were 16 percent and 12 percent of total assets, respectively. As of January 31, 2018 and 2017 , assets located in the United States were 83 percent and 86 percent of total assets, respectively. Revenues by geographical region are as follows (in thousands): ##TABLE_START  Fiscal Year Ended January 31,    Americas $ 7,579,116  $ 6,224,971  $ 4,910,745 Europe 1,903,524  1,373,547  1,162,808 Asia Pacific 997,372  793,466  593,663  $ 10,480,012  $ 8,391,984  $ 6,667,216 ##TABLE_ENDRevenues by geography are determined based on the region of the Salesforce contracting entity, which may be different than the region of the customer. Americas revenue attributed to the United States was approximately 96 percent , 96 percent and 95 percent during fiscal 2018 , 2017 and 2016 , respectively. No other country represented more than ten percent of total revenue during the fiscal 2018 , 2017 and 2016 . Revenue Recognition The Company derives its revenues from two sources: (1) subscription revenues, which are comprised of subscription fees from customers accessing the Companys enterprise cloud computing services and from customers paying for additional support beyond the standard support that is included in the basic subscription fees; and (2) related professional services such as process mapping, project management, implementation services and other revenue. Other revenue consists primarily of training fees. The Company commences revenue recognition when all of the following conditions are satisfied: ##TABLE_START  there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  the service has been or is being provided to the customer; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  the collection of the fees is reasonably assured; and ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  the amount of fees to be paid by the customer is fixed or determinable. ##TABLE_END The Companys subscription service arrangements are non-cancelable and do not contain refund-type provisions. Subscription and Support Revenues Subscription and support revenues are recognized ratably over the contract terms beginning on the commencement date of each contract, which is the date the Companys service is made available to customers. Amounts that have been invoiced are recorded in accounts receivable and in deferred revenue or revenue, depending on whether the revenue recognition criteria have been met. Professional Services and Other Revenues The Companys professional services contracts are either on a time and materials, fixed fee or subscription basis. These revenues are recognized as the services are rendered for time and materials contracts, when the milestones are achieved and accepted by the customer or on a proportional performance basis for fixed price contracts and ratably over the contract term for subscription professional services contracts. The milestone method for revenue recognition is used when there is substantive uncertainty at the date the contract is entered into whether the milestone will be achieved. Training revenues are recognized as the services are performed. Multiple Deliverable Arrangements The Company enters into arrangements with multiple deliverables that generally include multiple subscriptions, premium support and professional services. If the deliverables have standalone value at contract inception, the Company accounts for each deliverable separately. Subscription services have standalone value as such services are often sold separately. In determining whether professional services have standalone value, the Company considers the following factors for each professional services agreement: availability of the services from other vendors, the nature of the professional services, the timing of when the professional services contract was signed in comparison to the subscription service start date and the contractual dependence of the subscription service on the customers satisfaction with the professional services work. To date, the Company has concluded that all of the professional services included in multiple deliverable arrangements executed have standalone value. Multiple deliverables included in an arrangement are separated into different units of accounting and the arrangement consideration is allocated to the identified separate units based on a relative selling price hierarchy. The Company determines the relative selling price for a deliverable based on its vendor-specific objective evidence of selling price (VSOE), if available, or its best estimate of selling price (BESP), if VSOE is not available. The Company has determined that third-party evidence of selling price (TPE) is not a practical alternative due to differences in its service offerings compared to other parties and the availability of relevant third-party pricing information. The amount of revenue allocated to delivered items is limited by contingent revenue, if any. For certain professional services, the Company has established VSOE as a consistent number of standalone sales of these deliverables have been priced within a reasonably narrow range. The Company has not established VSOE for its subscription services due to lack of pricing consistency, the introduction of new services and other factors. Accordingly, the Company uses its BESP to determine the relative selling price for its subscription services. The Company determines BESP by considering its overall pricing objectives and market conditions. Significant pricing practices taken into consideration include the Companys discounting practices, the size and volume of the Companys transactions, the customer demographic, the geographic area where services are sold, price lists, its go-to-market strategy, historical standalone sales and contract prices. The determination of BESP is made through consultation with and approval by the Companys management, taking into consideration the go-to-market strategy. As the Companys go-to-market strategies evolve, the Company may modify its pricing practices in the future, which could result in changes in relative selling prices, including both VSOE and BESP. Deferred Revenue The deferred revenue balance does not represent the total contract value of annual or multi-year, non-cancelable subscription agreements. Deferred revenue primarily consists of billings or payments received in advance of revenue recognition from subscription services described above and is recognized as the revenue recognition criteria are met. The Company generally invoices customers in annual installments. The deferred revenue balance is influenced by several factors, including seasonality, the compounding effects of renewals, invoice duration, invoice timing, dollar size and new business linearity within the quarter. Deferred Commissions Deferred commissions are the incremental costs that are directly associated with non-cancelable subscription contracts with customers and consist of sales commissions paid to the Companys direct sales force. The commissions are deferred and amortized over the non-cancelable terms of the related customer contracts, which are typically 12 to 36 months . The commission payments are paid in full the month after the customers service commences and are a direct and incremental cost of the revenue arrangements. The deferred commission amounts are recoverable through the future revenue streams under the non-cancelable customer contracts. The Company believes this is the preferable method of accounting as the commission charges are so closely related to the revenue from the non-cancelable customer contracts that they should be recorded as an asset and charged to expense over the same period that the subscription revenue is recognized. Amortization of deferred commissions is included in marketing and sales expense in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations. During fiscal 2018 , the Company deferred $799.3 million of commission expenditures and amortized $464.7 million to marketing and sales expense. During the same period a year ago, the Company deferred $462.0 million of commission expenditures and amortized $371.5 million to marketing and sales expense. Deferred commissions on the Company's consolidated balance sheets totaled $874.3 million at January 31, 2018 and $539.6 million at January 31, 2017 . Cash and Cash Equivalents The Company considers all highly liquid investments purchased with an original maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents. Cash and cash equivalents are stated at fair value. Marketable Securities The Company considers all of its marketable debt securities as available for use in current operations, including those with maturity dates beyond one year, and therefore classifies these securities within current assets on the consolidated balance sheets. Securities are classified as available for sale and are carried at fair value, with the change in unrealized gains and losses, net of tax, reported as a separate component on the consolidated statements of comprehensive income until realized. Fair value is determined based on quoted market rates when observable or utilizing data points that are observable, such as quoted prices, interest rates and yield curves. Declines in fair value judged to be other-than-temporary on securities available for sale are included as a reduction to investment income. To determine whether a decline in value is other-than-temporary, the Company evaluates, among other factors: the duration and extent to which the fair value has been less than the carrying value and its intent and ability to retain the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in fair value. For the purposes of computing realized and unrealized gains and losses, the cost of securities sold is based on the specific-identification method. Interest on securities classified as available for sale is also included as a component of investment income. Strategic Investments The Company holds certain marketable equity and non-marketable debt and equity securities within its strategic investments portfolio. Marketable equity securities are measured using quoted prices in their respective active markets, non-marketable debt securities are recorded at their estimated fair value and the non-marketable equity securities are recorded at cost. Marketable equity securities and non-marketable debt securities, which consist of debt investments in privately held companies, are recorded at fair value with changes in fair value recorded through accumulated other comprehensive income. Equity investments without readily determinable fair values for which the Company does not have the ability to exercise significant influence are accounted for using the cost method of accounting. Under the cost method of accounting, the non-marketable securities are carried at cost and are adjusted only for other-than-temporary impairments, certain distributions and additional investments. These investments are valued using significant unobservable inputs or data in an inactive market and the valuation requires the Company's judgment due to the absence of market prices and inherent lack of liquidity. The estimated fair value is based on quantitative and qualitative factors including, but not limited to, subsequent financing activities by the investee and projected discounted cash flows. The carrying value of the Companys strategic investments is impacted by various events such as entering into new investments, dispositions due to acquisitions, fair market value adjustments or initial public offerings. The cash inflows from exits and cash outflows for new investments are disclosed within the investing activities section of the statement of cash flows and any realized gains or losses are recorded within the operating activities of the statements of cash flows for each of the respective fiscal quarter periods. Derivative Financial Instruments The Company enters into foreign currency derivative contracts with financial institutions to reduce foreign exchange risk. The Company uses forward currency derivative contracts to minimize the Companys exposure to balances primarily denominated in the Euro, British Pound Sterling, Japanese Yen, Canadian Dollar and Australian Dollar. The Companys foreign currency derivative contracts, which are not designated as hedging instruments, are used to reduce the exchange rate risk associated primarily with intercompany receivables and payables. The Companys derivative financial instruments program is not designated for trading or speculative purposes. As of January 31, 2018 and 2017 , the outstanding foreign currency derivative contracts were recorded at fair value on the consolidated balance sheets. Foreign currency derivative contracts are marked-to-market at the end of each reporting period with gains and losses recognized as other expense to offset the gains or losses resulting from the settlement or remeasurement of the underlying foreign currency denominated receivables and payables. While the contract or notional amount is often used to express the volume of foreign currency derivative contracts, the amounts potentially subject to credit risk are generally limited to the amounts, if any, by which the counterparties obligations under the agreements exceed the obligations of the Company to the counterparties. Fair Value Measurement The Company measures its cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities and foreign currency derivative contracts at fair value. The additional disclosures regarding the Companys fair value measurements are included in Note 4 Fair Value Measurement. Property and Equipment Property and equipment are stated at cost. Depreciation is calculated on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of those assets as follows: ##TABLE_START Computers, equipment and software 3 to 9 years Furniture and fixtures 5 years Leasehold improvements Shorter of the estimated lease term or 10 years Building and structural components Average weighted useful life of 32 years Building - leased facility 27 years Building improvements 10 years ##TABLE_ENDWhen assets are retired or otherwise disposed of, the cost and accumulated depreciation and amortization are removed from their respective accounts and any loss on such retirement is reflected in operating expenses. Capitalized Software Costs The Company capitalizes costs related to its enterprise cloud computing services and certain projects for internal use incurred during the application development stage. Costs related to preliminary project activities and post implementation activities are expensed as incurred. Internal-use software is amortized on a straight-line basis over its estimated useful life, which is generally three to five years. Management evaluates the useful lives of these assets on an annual basis and tests for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances occur that could impact the recoverability of these assets. Intangible Assets acquired through Business Combinations Intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives. Each period, the Company evaluates the estimated remaining useful life of its intangible assets and whether events or changes in circumstances warrant a revision to the remaining period of amortization. Impairment Assessment The Company evaluates intangible assets and long-lived assets for possible impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable. This includes but is not limited to significant adverse changes in business climate, market conditions, or other events that indicate an asset's carrying amount may not be recoverable. Recoverability of these assets is measured by comparing the carrying amount of each asset to the future undiscounted cash flows the asset is expected to generate. If the undiscounted cash flows used in the test for recoverability are less than the carrying amount of these assets, the carrying amount of such assets is reduced to fair value. The Company evaluates and tests the recoverability of its goodwill for impairment at least annually during its fourth quarter of each fiscal year or more often if and when circumstances indicate that goodwill may not be recoverable. There was no impairment of intangible assets, long-lived assets or goodwill during fiscal 2018 , 2017 and 2016 . Business Combinations The Company uses its best estimates and assumptions to assign fair value to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date. The Companys estimates are inherently uncertain and subject to refinement. During the measurement period, which may be up to one year from the acquisition date, the Company may record adjustments to the fair value of these tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed, with the corresponding offset to goodwill. In addition, uncertain tax positions and tax-related valuation allowances are initially recorded in connection with a business combination as of the acquisition date. The Company continues to collect information and reevaluates these estimates and assumptions quarterly and records any adjustments to the Companys preliminary estimates to goodwill provided that the Company is within the measurement period. Upon the conclusion of the measurement period or final determination of the fair value of assets acquired or liabilities assumed, whichever comes first, any subsequent adjustments are recorded to the Companys consolidated statements of operations. In the event the Company acquires an entity with which the Company has a preexisting relationship, the Company will recognize a gain or loss to settle that relationship as of the acquisition date, which is recorded in other income (expense) within the statements of operations. In the event that the Company acquires an entity in which the Company previously held a strategic investment, the difference between the fair value of the shares as of the date of the acquisition and the carrying value of the strategic investment is recorded as a gain or loss and disclosed separately within the statements of operations. Leases and Asset Retirement Obligations The Company categorizes leases at their inception as either operating or capital leases. In certain lease agreements, the Company may receive rent holidays and other incentives. The Company recognizes lease costs on a straight-line basis once control of the space is achieved, without regard to deferred payment terms such as rent holidays that defer the commencement date of required payments. Additionally, incentives received are treated as a reduction of costs over the term of the agreement. The Company establishes assets and liabilities for the present value of estimated future costs to retire long-lived assets at the termination or expiration of a lease. Such assets are depreciated over the lease period to operating expense. In the event the Company is the deemed owner for accounting purposes during construction, the Company records assets and liabilities for the estimated construction costs incurred under build-to-suit lease arrangements to the extent it is involved in the construction of structural improvements or takes construction risk prior to commencement of a lease. The Company additionally has entered into subleases for unoccupied leased office space. To the extent there are losses associated with the sublease, they are recognized in the period the sublease is executed. Gains are recognized over the sublease life. Any sublease payments received in excess of the straight-line rent payments for the sublease are recorded in other income (expense). Accounting for Stock-Based Expense The Company recognizes stock-based expenses related to stock options and restricted stock awards on a straight-line basis, net of estimated forfeitures, over the requisite service period of the awards, which is generally the vesting term of four years . The Company recognizes stock-based expenses related to shares issued pursuant to its Amended and Restated 2004 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (ESPP or 2004 Employee Stock Purchase Plan) on a straight-line basis over the offering period, which is 12 months . The ESPP allows employees to purchase shares of the Company's common stock at a 15 percent discount and also allows employees to reduce their percentage election once during a six month purchase period (December 15 and June 15 of each fiscal year), but not increase that election until the next one-year offering period. The ESPP also includes a re-set provision for the purchase price if the stock price on the purchase date is less than the stock price on the offering date. Stock-based expenses related to performance share grants are measured based on grant date fair value and expensed on a straight-line basis over the service period of the awards, which is generally the vesting term of three years. The Company, at times, grants unvested restricted shares to employee stockholders of certain acquired companies in lieu of cash consideration. These awards are generally subject to continued post-acquisition employment. Therefore, the Company accounts for them as post-acquisition stock-based expense. The Company recognizes stock-based expense equal to the grant date fair value of the restricted stock awards on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period of the awards, which is generally four years . Advertising Expenses Advertising is expensed as incurred. Advertising expense was $372.9 million , $350.3 million and $315.6 million for fiscal 2018 , 2017 and 2016 , respectively. Income Taxes The Company uses the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on temporary differences between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax laws is recognized in the consolidated statements of operations in the period that includes the enactment date. The Companys tax positions are subject to income tax audits by multiple tax jurisdictions throughout the world. The Company recognizes the tax benefit of an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the position is sustainable upon examination by the taxing authority, solely based on its technical merits. The tax benefit recognized is measured as the largest amount of benefit which is greater than 50 percent likely to be realized upon settlement with the taxing authority. The Company recognizes interest accrued and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in the income tax provision. Valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amounts that are more likely than not expected to be realized based on the weighting of positive and negative evidence. Future realization of deferred tax assets ultimately depends on the existence of sufficient taxable income of the appropriate character (for example, ordinary income or capital gain) within the carryback or carryforward periods available under the applicable tax law. The Company regularly reviews the deferred tax assets for recoverability based on historical taxable income, projected future taxable income, the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences and tax planning strategies. The Companys judgments regarding future profitability may change due to many factors, including future market conditions and the ability to successfully execute its business plans and/or tax planning strategies. Should there be a change in the ability to recover deferred tax assets, the tax provision would increase or decrease in the period in which the assessment is changed. In December 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (\"Tax Act\") was enacted into law, significantly changing income tax law that affects U.S corporations. Key changes included a corporate tax rate reduction from 35 percent to 21 percent effective January 1, 2018, expensing of certain qualified property, significant changes to the U.S international tax system such as a one-time transition tax on accumulated foreign earnings, and how foreign earnings are subject to U.S. tax. The Company is required to recognize the effects of the tax law changes in the period of enactment, including the determination of the transition tax and the re-measurement of deferred taxes as well as to re-assess the realizability of the deferred tax assets. Subsequent to the enactment of the Tax Act, the SEC staff issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118, Income Tax Accounting Implications of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (\"SAB 118\"), which allows companies to record provisional amounts related to the effects of the Tax Act during a measurement period not to extend beyond one year from the enactment date. Due to the timing of the Tax Act and additional guidance and interpretations that may be issued by the U.S. Treasury Department, the Internal Revenue Service (\"IRS\") and other standard-setting bodies in the future, the Company has not completed its analysis of the income tax effects of the Tax Act. The provisional estimates will be adjusted during the measurement period defined under SAB 118, based upon the Company's ongoing analysis of its data and tax positions along with new guidance from regulators and interpretations of the law. Foreign Currency Translation The functional currency of the Companys major foreign subsidiaries is generally the local currency. Adjustments resulting from translating foreign functional currency financial statements into U.S. dollars are recorded as a separate component on the consolidated statements of comprehensive income. Foreign currency transaction gains and losses are included in Other income (expense) in the consolidated statements of operations for the period. All assets and liabilities denominated in a foreign currency are translated into U.S. dollars at the exchange rate on the balance sheet date. Revenues and expenses are translated at the average exchange rate during the period. Equity transactions are translated using historical exchange rates. Warranties and Indemnification The Companys enterprise cloud computing services are typically warranted to perform in a manner consistent with general industry standards that are reasonably applicable and materially in accordance with the Companys online help documentation under normal use and circumstances. The Companys arrangements generally include certain provisions for indemnifying customers against liabilities if its products or services infringe a third partys intellectual property rights. To date, the Company has not incurred any material costs as a result of such obligations and has not accrued any material liabilities related to such obligations in the accompanying consolidated financial statements. The Company has also agreed to indemnify its directors and executive officers for costs associated with any fees, expenses, judgments, fines and settlement amounts incurred by any of these persons in any action or proceeding to which any of those persons is, or is threatened to be, made a party by reason of the persons service as a director or officer, including any action by the Company, arising out of that persons services as the Companys director or officer or that persons services provided to any other company or enterprise at the Companys request. The Company maintains director and officer insurance coverage that would generally enable the Company to recover a portion of any future amounts paid. The Company may also be subject to indemnification obligations by law with respect to the actions of its employees under certain circumstances and in certain jurisdictions. New Accounting Pronouncements Adopted in Fiscal 2018 In January 2017, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (\"FASB\") issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2017-01, \"Business Combinations (Topic 805) Clarifying the Definition of a Business\" (\"ASU 2017-01\") which amended the existing FASB Accounting Standards Codification. The standard provides additional guidance to assist entities with evaluating whether transactions should be accounted for as acquisitions (or disposals) of assets or businesses. The definition of a business affects many areas of accounting, including acquisitions, disposals, goodwill, and consolidation. ASU 2017-01 is effective for fiscal 2019 with early adoption permitted. The Company early adopted the standard in the first quarter of fiscal 2018 on a prospective basis. Since the Company has not acquired any material businesses since the start of the year, this standard has had no impact on the Company's financial statements. In May 2017, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2017-09, \"CompensationStock Compensation (Topic 718): Scope of Modification Accounting\" (\"ASU 2017-09\") which amended the existing FASB Accounting Standards Codification. The standard provides clarity and reduces the cost and complexity when applying the guidance in Topic 718, CompensationStock Compensation, to a change to the terms or conditions of a share-based payment award. ASU 2017-09 is effective for fiscal 2019 with early adoption permitted. The Company early adopted the standard in the second quarter of fiscal 2018 on a prospective basis and this standard has had no impact on the Company's financial statements. Accounting Pronouncements Pending Adoption In May 2014, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2014-09, \"Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606)\" (\"ASU 2014-09\"), which amended the existing FASB Accounting Standards Codification and replaces the existing revenue recognition guidance with a comprehensive revenue measurement and recognition standard and expanded disclosure requirements. The standard also provides guidance on the recognition of costs related to obtaining customer contracts. ASU 2014-09, as amended, will be effective as of the beginning of fiscal 2019, including interim periods within that reporting period. The Company plans to adopt the standard using the full retrospective method to restate each prior reporting period presented. The Company does not expect the adoption of ASU 2014-09 to have any impact on its total cash flows from operating, investing or financing activities. Revenue pursuant to ASU 2014-09 The Company is continuing to assess the impact of adopting ASU 2014-09 on its financial position, results of operations and related disclosures and believes that the impact is not material. The Company believes that the new standard will impact the following policies and disclosures: ##TABLE_START  removal of the current limitation on contingent revenue will result in revenue being recognized earlier for certain contracts; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  allocation of subscription and support revenue across different clouds and to professional services revenue; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  estimation of variable consideration for arrangements with overage fees; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  required disclosures including disaggregation of revenues, information about the remaining transaction price and when the Company expects to recognize revenue; and ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  accounting for deferred commissions including costs that qualify for deferral and the amortization period. ##TABLE_END Capitalized costs to acquire a contract pursuant to ASU 2014-09 The accounting for capitalized costs to acquire a contract under the new standard is significantly different than the Companys current accounting for deferred commissions. The new guidance results in the capitalization of significantly more costs and longer amortization lives. Under the Companys current accounting, the Company only capitalizes sales commissions that have a direct relationship to a specific new revenue contract. Currently, payments made to those employees not directly related to the sale of a new contract or those related to any renewals, including the associated fringe benefits and payroll taxes, and partner referral fees are not capitalized. Additionally, all amounts capitalized under the Companys current policy are amortized over the specific contract terms of the underlying new revenue arrangements, which were typically 12 to 36 months. Under the new standard, the Company will capitalize incremental costs of acquiring a non-cancelable subscription and support revenue contract. The capitalized amounts will consist primarily of sales commissions paid to the Companys direct sales force. Capitalized amounts will also include (1) amounts paid to employees other than the direct sales force who earn incentive payouts under annual compensation plans that are tied to the value of contracts acquired, (2) commissions paid to employees upon renewals of subscription and support contracts, (3) the associated payroll taxes and fringe benefit costs associated with the payments to the Companys employees, and to a lesser extent (4) success fees paid to partners in emerging markets where the Company has a limited presence. Capitalized costs related to new revenue contracts will be amortized on a straight-line basis over four years, which, although longer than the typical initial contract period, reflects the average period of benefit, including expected contract renewals. In arriving at this average period of benefit, the Company evaluated both qualitative and quantitative factors, including the estimated life cycles of its offerings and its customer attrition. Additionally, the Company will amortize capitalized costs for renewals and success fees paid to partners over two years. While the Company has not yet finalized its assessment of the impact the new commission accounting policy will have on its financial position and results of operations, the Company believes it will be material to both its balance sheet and statement of operations due to the capitalization of additional costs and the longer period of amortization. In January 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-01, \"Financial Instrument-Overall (Subtopic 825-10)\" (\"ASU 2016-01\"), which requires entities to measure equity instruments at fair value and recognize any changes in fair value within the statement of operations. Under the new standard, the Company will record its publicly traded equity investments at fair value on a quarterly basis and record the change within the statement of operations. Previously, such adjustments were recorded in other comprehensive income. The guidance provides for electing the measurement alternative or defaulting to the fair value option for equity investments that do not have readily determinable fair values.  The Company plans to elect the measurement alternative for its equity investments in privately held companies, which are included in strategic investments in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. These investments will be measured at cost, less any impairment, plus or minus adjustments resulting from observable price changes in orderly transactions for the identical or a similar investment of the same issuer, which will be recorded within the statement of operations. The determination of whether a transaction is for a similar investment will require significant management judgment including consideration of the rights and obligations between the investments and the extent to which those differences would affect the fair values of those investments with additional consideration for the stage of development of the investee company. In addition, the determination of fair value for those investments with orderly transactions for similar investments may require significant assumptions and complex valuation models, all of which requires management judgment due to the absence of market prices and lack of liquidity. The new standard is effective as of the beginning of fiscal 2019, including interim periods within that reporting period, on a prospective basis for nonmarketable equity securities and a modified retrospective basis for publicly held equity investments. The adoption of ASU 2016-01 will impact the Company's strategic investments portfolio, which consists of approximately $24.5 million in publicly traded equity investments and $599.3 million in privately held equity investments, as of January 31, 2018 , both of which are recorded in strategic investments within the balance sheet. Upon adoption of ASU 2016-01, the Company will reclassify $13.0 million , excluding the tax impact, from accumulated other comprehensive loss on the balance sheet to accumulated deficit. This amount reflects unrealized gains recorded on the Company's publicly traded equity investments as of January 31, 2018. Refer to Note 2, \"Investments,\" for additional details. The new standard could have a material impact to the Company's consolidated financial statements, including additional volatility to the Company's statements of operations in future periods, due to changes in market prices of the Company's investments in publicly held equity investments and the valuation and timing of observable price changes and impairments of its investments in non-marketable securities. In October 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-16, \"Income Taxes (Topic 740): Intra-Entity Transfers of Assets Other Than Inventory\" (\"ASU 2016-16\"), which requires entities to recognize the income tax consequences of an intra-entity transfer of an asset, other than inventory, when the transfer occurs. The new standard is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017, with early adoption permitted as of the beginning of a fiscal year. The Company plans to adopt the new standard in its first quarter of fiscal 2019. Based on transactions up to January 31, 2018, the Company does not expect the adoption of this standard to have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements. In February 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-02, \"Leases (Topic 842)\" (\"ASU 2016-02\"), which requires lessees to record most leases on their balance sheets but recognize the expenses on their statements of operations in a manner similar to current accounting rules. ASU 2016-02 states that a lessee would recognize a lease liability for the obligation to make lease payments and a right-to-use asset for the right to use the underlying asset for the lease term. The new standard is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2018 on a modified retrospective basis. The Company is in the process of implementing changes to its systems, processes and controls, in conjunction with its review of existing lease agreements, in order to adopt the new standard in its first quarter of fiscal 2020. The Company expects its leases designated as operating leases in Note 13, Commitments, will be reported on the consolidated balance sheets upon adoption. The Company is currently evaluating the impact to its consolidated financial statements as it relates to other aspects of the business. Reclassifications Certain reclassifications to fiscal 2017 and 2016 balances were made to conform to the current period presentation in the consolidated balance sheets, consolidated statement of operations and consolidated statements of cash flows. These reclassifications include cost of revenues-subscription and support, cost of revenues-professional services and other, and purchases and sales of strategic investments. 2.

The Company does not believe any of the unrealized losses represent an other-than-temporary impairment based on its evaluation of available evidence as of January 31, 2018 , such as the Company's intent to hold and whether it is more likely than not that the Company will be required to sell the investment before recovery of the investment's amortized basis. The Company expects to receive the full principal and interest on all of these marketable securities. Investment Income Investment income consists of interest income, realized gains and realized losses on the Companys cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities. The components of investment income are presented below (in thousands): ##TABLE_START  Fiscal Year Ended January 31,    Interest income $ 36,480  $ 21,901  $ 14,146 Realized gains  7,858  3,287 Realized losses (1,572 )  (2,385 )  (2,092 ) Total investment income $ 35,848  $ 27,374  $ 15,341 ##TABLE_ENDReclassification adjustments out of accumulated other comprehensive income into investment income were immaterial for fiscal 2018 , 2017 and 2016 . Strategic Investments As of January 31, 2018 , the Company had two investments in marketable equity securities with a fair value of $24.5 million , which included an unrealized gain of $13.0 million . As of January 31, 2017 , the Company had six investments in marketable equity securities with a fair value of $41.0 million , which included an unrealized gain of $24.5 million . The change in the fair value of the investments in publicly held companies is recorded in the consolidated balance sheets within strategic investments and accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). As of January 31, 2018 and 2017 , the carrying value of the Companys non-marketable debt and equity securities was $652.8 million and $526.0 million , respectively. The estimated fair value of the non-marketable debt and equity securities was approximately $912.0 million and $758.3 million as of January 31, 2018 and 2017 , respectively. The Company sold a portion of its publicly-held investments in fiscal 2018 , which resulted in a reclassification of previously unrealized gains from the statement of comprehensive income (loss) to other income (expense) in the statement of operations in the amount of $58.6 million . This amount was not material in prior periods.

Fair Value Measurement The Company uses a three-tier fair value hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used in the valuation methodologies in measuring fair value: Level 1. Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. Level 2. Significant other inputs that are directly or indirectly observable in the marketplace. Level 3. Significant unobservable inputs which are supported by little or no market activity. All of the Companys cash equivalents, marketable securities and foreign currency derivative contracts are classified within Level 1 or Level 2 because the Companys cash equivalents, marketable securities and foreign currency derivative contracts are valued using quoted market prices or alternative pricing sources and models utilizing observable market inputs. The following table presents information about the Companys assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value as of January 31, 2018 and indicates the fair value hierarchy of the valuation (in thousands): ##TABLE_START Description Quoted Prices in Active Markets for Identical Assets (Level 1)  Significant Other Observable Inputs (Level 2)  Significant Unobservable Inputs (Level 3)  Balances as of January 31, 2018 Cash equivalents (1):        Time deposits $  $ 542,756  $  $ 542,756 Money market mutual funds 1,389,165    1,389,165 Marketable securities:        Corporate notes and obligations  1,216,365   1,216,365 U.S. treasury securities  194,300   194,300 Mortgage backed obligations  98,751   98,751 Asset backed securities  250,029   250,029 Municipal securities  52,317   52,317 Foreign government obligations  85,645   85,645 U.S. agency obligations  19,126   19,126 Commercial Paper  11,429   11,429 Covered bonds  50,259   50,259 Foreign currency derivative contracts (2)  17,949   17,949 Total assets $ 1,389,165  $ 2,538,926  $  $ 3,928,091 Liabilities:        Foreign currency derivative contracts (3)  5,581   5,581 Total liabilities $  $ 5,581  $  $ 5,581 ##TABLE_END___________ (1) Included in cash and cash equivalents in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet as of January 31, 2018 , in addition to $611.6 million of cash.

Certain terms of the conversion features of the 0.25% Senior Notes are as follows: ##TABLE_START  Conversion Rate per $1,000 Par Value  Initial Conversion Price per Share  Convertible Date 0.25% Senior Notes 15.0512  $ 66.44  January 1, 2018 ##TABLE_ENDThroughout the term of the 0.25% Senior Notes, the conversion rate may be adjusted upon the occurrence of certain events, including any cash dividends. Holders of the 0.25% Senior Notes will not receive any cash payment representing accrued and unpaid interest upon conversion of a Note. Accrued but unpaid interest will be deemed to be paid in full upon conversion rather than canceled, extinguished or forfeited. As of January 31, 2018, holders may convert the 0.25% Senior Notes at any time on or after the convertible date noted in the table above and as described in the indenture. Holders of the 0.25% Senior Notes have the right to require the Company to purchase with cash all or a portion of the Notes upon the occurrence of a fundamental change, such as a change of control, at a purchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the 0.25% Senior Notes plus accrued and unpaid interest. Following certain corporate transactions that constitute a change of control, the Company will increase the conversion rate for a holder who elects to convert the 0.25% Senior Notes in connection with such change of control. In accounting for the issuances of the 0.25% Senior Notes, the Company separated the 0.25% Senior Notes into liability and equity components. The carrying amount of the liability component was calculated by measuring the fair value of a similar liability that does not have an associated convertible feature. The carrying amount of the equity component representing the conversion option was determined by deducting the fair value of the liability component from the par value of the 0.25% Senior Notes as a whole. The excess of the principal amount of the liability component over its carrying amount (debt discount) is amortized to interest expense over the term of the 0.25% Senior Notes. The equity component is not remeasured as long as it continues to meet the conditions for equity classification. As holders of the 0.25% Senior Notes are eligible to exercise their conversion option as of January 31, 2018, the equity component related to convertible debt instruments is required to be reclassified from permanent equity to temporary equity. Therefore, the difference between (1) the amount of cash deliverable upon conversion (i.e., par value of debt) and (2) the carrying value of the debt component has been reclassified from permanent equity to temporary equity. In accounting for the transaction costs related to the 0.25% Senior Notes issuance, the Company allocated the total amount incurred to the liability and equity components based on their relative values. Transaction costs attributable to the liability component are being amortized to expense over the terms of the 0.25% Senior Notes, and transaction costs attributable to the equity component were netted with the equity component in stockholders equity. The 0.25% Senior Notes consisted of the following (in thousands): ##TABLE_START  As of  January 31, 2018  January 31, 2017 Liability component:    Principal (1) $ 1,026,821  $ 1,150,000 Less: debt discount, net (2) (3,867 )  (29,954 ) Less: debt issuance cost (366 )  (3,686 ) Net carrying amount $ 1,022,588  $ 1,116,360 ##TABLE_END(1) The effective interest rate of the 0.25% Senior Notes is 2.53% . The interest rate is based on the interest rates of similar liabilities at the time of issuance that did not have an associated convertible feature. (2) Included in the consolidated balance sheets within Convertible 0.25% Senior Notes (which is classified as a current liability as of January 31, 2018 and a noncurrent liability as of January 31, 2017) and is amortized over the life of the 0.25% Senior Notes using the effective interest rate method. The total estimated fair value of the Company's 0.25% Senior Notes at January 31, 2018 was $1.8 billion . The fair value was determined based on the closing trading price per $100 of the 0.25% Senior Notes as of the last day of trading for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018 . Based on the closing price of the Companys common stock of $113.91 on January 31, 2018 , the if-converted value of the 0.25% Senior Notes exceeded their principal amount by approximately $733.6 million . During fiscal 2018 , $123.2 million of the 0.25% Senior Notes outstanding was converted by noteholders. The Company recorded a loss of approximately $0.2 million during fiscal 2018 related to the extinguishment of the 0.25% Senior Notes converted by noteholders, which represents the difference between the fair market value allocated to the liability component on the settlement date and the net carrying amount of the liability component and unamortized debt issuance costs on the settlement date. As of January 31, 2018 the remaining principal balance of the 0.25% Senior Notes outstanding is approximately $1.03 billion . The remaining principal balance of the 0.25% Senior Notes matures in April 2018 unless earlier converted by noteholders. Since January 31, 2018 through the filing date of this Form 10-K, $73.6 million of the remaining principal balance of the 0.25% Senior Notes has been converted or has requested conversion. Note Hedges To minimize the impact of potential economic dilution upon conversion of the Notes, the Company entered into convertible note hedge transactions with respect to its common stock ( 0.25% Note Hedges). ##TABLE_START (in thousands, except for shares) Date  Purchase  Shares 0.25% Note Hedges March 2013  $ 153,800  17,308,880 ##TABLE_ENDThe 0.25% Note Hedges cover shares of the Companys common stock at a strike price that corresponds to the initial conversion price of the 0.25% Senior Notes, also subject to adjustment, and are exercisable upon conversion of the Notes. The 0.25% Note Hedges will expire upon the maturity of the 0.25% Senior Notes. The 0.25% Note Hedges are intended to reduce the potential economic dilution upon conversion of the 0.25% Senior Notes in the event that the market value per share of the Companys common stock, as measured under the 0.25% Senior Notes, at the time of exercise is greater than the conversion price of the 0.25% Senior Notes. The 0.25% Note Hedges are separate transactions and are not part of the terms of the 0.25% Senior Notes. Holders of the 0.25% Senior Notes will not have any rights with respect to the 0.25% Note Hedges. The 0.25% Note Hedges do not impact earnings per share. As a result of the conversions of the 0.25% Senior Notes that were settled during fiscal 2018, the Company exercised its rights on the corresponding portion of the 0.25% Note Hedges and received approximately 675,000 shares of the Company's common stock. Warrants ##TABLE_START  Date  Proceeds (in thousands)  Shares  Strike Price 0.25% Warrants March 2013  $ 84,800  17,308,880  $ 90.40 ##TABLE_ENDIn March 2013, the Company also entered into a warrants transaction ( 0.25% Warrants), whereby the Company sold warrants to acquire, subject to anti-dilution adjustments, shares of the Companys common stock. If the 0.25% Warrants are not exercised on their exercise dates, which are in fiscal 2019, they will expire. For periods in which the market value per share of the Company's common stock exceeds the applicable exercise price of the 0.25% Warrants and the Company is profitable, the 0.25% Warrants have a dilutive effect on the Company's earnings per share. The 0.25% Warrants are separate transactions entered into by the Company and are not part of the terms of the 0.25% Senior Notes or the 0.25% Note Hedges. Holders of the 0.25% Senior Notes and 0.25% Note Hedges will not have any rights with respect to the 0.25% Warrants. Term Loan In July 2016, the Company entered into a credit agreement (Term Loan Credit Agreement) with Bank of America, N.A. and certain other institutional lenders for a $500.0 million term loan facility (Term Loan) that matures in July 2019. The Term Loan will bear interest, at the Companys option, at either a base rate plus a spread of 0.00% to 0.75% or an adjusted LIBOR rate plus a spread of 1.00% to 1.75% , in each case with such spread being determined based on the Companys consolidated leverage ratio for the preceding four fiscal quarter period. In July 2016, the Company borrowed the full $500.0 million under the Term Loan. All of the net proceeds of the Term Loan were for the purpose of partially funding the acquisition of Demandware. Interest on the Term Loan is due and payable in arrears quarterly for loans bearing interest at a rate based on the base rate and at the end of an interest period in the case of loans bearing interest at the adjusted LIBOR rate. All outstanding amounts under the Term Loan Credit Agreement will be due and payable in July 2019. The Company may prepay the Term Loan, in whole or in part, at any time without premium or penalty, subject to certain conditions, and amounts repaid or prepaid may not be reborrowed. The Companys obligations under the Term Loan Credit Agreement are required to be guaranteed by certain of its subsidiaries meeting certain thresholds set forth in the Term Loan Credit Agreement. The weighted average interest rate on the Term Loan was 2.2% for fiscal 2018 . Accrued interest on the Term Loan was $0.3 million as of January 31, 2018 . As of January 31, 2018 , the noncurrent outstanding principal portion was $500.0 million . Revolving Credit Facility In July 2016, the Company entered into an Amended and Restated Credit Agreement ( Revolving Loan Credit Agreement ) with Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, and certain other institutional lenders that provides for $1.0 billion unsecured revolving credit facility (Credit Facility) that matures in July 2021. The Revolving Loan Credit Agreement amended and restated the Companys existing revolving credit facility dated October 2014. The Company may use the proceeds of future borrowings under the Credit Facility for refinancing other indebtedness, working capital, capital expenditures and other general corporate purposes, including permitted acquisitions. The borrowings under the Credit Facility bear interest, at the Companys option, at a base rate plus a spread of 0.00% to 0.75% or an adjusted LIBOR rate plus a spread of 1.00% to 1.75% , in each case with such spread being determined based on the Companys consolidated leverage ratio for the preceding four fiscal quarter period. Interest is due and payable in arrears quarterly for loans bearing interest at a rate based on the base rate and at the end of an interest period in the case of loans bearing interest at the adjusted LIBOR rate. Regardless of what amounts, if any, are outstanding under the Credit Facility, the Company is also obligated to pay an ongoing commitment fee on undrawn amounts at a rate of 0.125% to 0.25% , with such rate being based on the Companys consolidated leverage ratio for the preceding four fiscal quarter period, payable in arrears quarterly. In fiscal 2018, the Company paid down the remaining $200.0 million of outstanding borrowings under the Credit Facility. There were no outstanding borrowings under the Credit Facility as of January 31, 2018 . The Company continues to pay a commitment fee on the available amount of the Credit Facility. Loan Assumed on 50 Fremont The Company assumed a $200.0 million loan with the acquisition of 50 Fremont (Loan). The Loan bears an interest rate of 3.75% per annum and is due in June 2023. Beginning in fiscal 2019, principal and interest payments are required, with the remaining principal due at maturity. For fiscal 2018 and 2017 , total interest expense recognized was $7.5 million and $7.5 million , respectively. The Loan can be prepaid at any time subject to a yield maintenance fee. The agreement governing the Loan contains certain customary affirmative and negative covenants that the Company was in compliance with as of January 31, 2018 .

Stockholders Equity The Company maintains the following stock plans: the ESPP, the 2013 Equity Incentive Plan and the 2014 Inducement Equity Incentive Plan (2014 Inducement Plan). As of January 31, 2018 and 2017, $62.8 million and $48.4 million , respectively, was withheld on behalf of employees for future purchases under the ESPP and is recorded in accounts payable, accrued expenses and other liabilities. Prior to February 2006, options issued under the Companys stock option plans generally had a term of 10 years. From February 1, 2006 through July 2013, options issued had a term of five years. After July 2013, options issued have a term of seven years. The fair value of each stock option grant was estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model with the following assumptions and fair value per share: ##TABLE_START  Fiscal Year Ended January 31, Stock Options    Volatility 28.0 - 31.4 %  31.4 - 32.3 %  32.0 - 37.0 % Estimated life 3.5 years   3.5 years   3.5 years  Risk-free interest rate 1.4 - 2.3 %  0.9 - 1.6 %  1.1 - 1.4 % Weighted-average fair value per share of grants $ 22.71   $ 19.13   $ 20.22  ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Fiscal Year Ended January 31, ESPP   Volatility 21.3- 27.6 %  28.2 - 35.2 %  30.0 - 34.0 % Estimated life 0.75 years   0.75 years   0.75 years  Risk-free interest rate 1.1 - 1.7 %  0.5 - 1.0 %  0.1 - 0.8 % Weighted-average fair value per share of grants $ 23.64   $ 20.18   $ 19.49  ##TABLE_ENDThe Company estimated its future stock price volatility considering both its observed option-implied volatilities and its historical volatility calculations. Management believes this is the best estimate of the expected volatility over the expected life of its stock options and stock purchase rights. The estimated life for the stock options was based on an analysis of historical exercise activity. The risk-free interest rate is based on the rate for a U.S. government security with the same estimated life at the time of the option grant and the stock purchase rights. The estimated forfeiture rate applied is based on historical forfeiture rates. The Company does not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future and therefore uses an expected dividend yield of zero in the option pricing model. During fiscal 2016, the Company granted a performance-based restricted stock unit award to the Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer and during fiscal 2017, the Company granted performance-based restricted stock unit awards to certain executive officers, including the Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer. The performance-based restricted stock unit awards are subject to vesting based on a performance-based condition and a service-based condition. At the end of the three -year service period, based on the Company's share price performance, these performance-based restricted stock units will vest in a percentage of the target number of shares between 0 and 200% , depending on the extent the performance condition is achieved. Stock activity excluding the ESPP is as follows: ##TABLE_START    Options Outstanding  Shares Available for Grant  Outstanding Stock Options  Weighted- Average Exercise Price  Aggregate Intrinsic Value (in thousands) Balance as of January 31, 2017 16,531,822  30,353,076  $ 59.88   Increase in shares authorized:        2013 Equity Incentive Plan 37,009,109   0.00   2014 Inducement Plan 16,198   0.00   Options granted under all plans (1,212,731 )  1,212,731  91.76   Restricted stock activity (3,302,885 )   0.00   Stock grants to board and advisory board members (211,588 )   0.00   Exercised  (8,288,960 )  46.41   Plan shares expired (59,262 )   0.00   Canceled 1,541,850  (1,541,850 )  71.66   Balance as of January 31, 2018 50,312,513  21,734,997  $ 65.96  $ 1,042,149 Vested or expected to vest   20,533,483  $ 65.40  $ 996,145 Exercisable as of January 31, 2018   11,259,046  $ 60.44  $ 601,993 ##TABLE_ENDThe total intrinsic value of the options exercised during fiscal 2018 , 2017 and 2016 was $373.0 million , $224.3 million and $291.3 million , respectively. The intrinsic value is the difference between the current market value of the stock and the exercise price of the stock option. The weighted-average remaining contractual life of vested and expected to vest options is approximately 5 years. As of January 31, 2018 , options to purchase 11,259,046 shares were vested at a weighted average exercise price of $60.44 per share and had a remaining weighted-average contractual life of approximately 4.2 years. The total intrinsic value of these vested options as of January 31, 2018 was $602.0 million . During fiscal 2018 , the Company recognized stock-based expense related to its equity plans for employees and non-employee directors of $997.0 million . As of January 31, 2018 , the aggregate stock compensation remaining to be amortized to costs and expenses was approximately $1.8 billion . The Company will amortize this stock compensation balance as follows: $855.4 million during fiscal 2019 ; $582.7 million during fiscal 2020 ; $318.1 million during fiscal 2021 ; $59.5 million during fiscal 2022 ; $17.2 million during fiscal 2023 and $8.0 million thereafter. The expected amortization reflects only outstanding stock awards as of January 31, 2018 and assumes no forfeiture activity. In prior years, the Company had an annual equity grant cycle for employees in the month of November. During fiscal 2018, the Company changed its annual equity grant to occur in the month of March, starting in fiscal 2019. The Company granted 14.9 million shares under the annual equity grant in fiscal 2017 whereas the Company did not grant any shares under the annual equity grant in fiscal 2018.

Preferred Stock The Companys board of directors has the authority, without further action by stockholders, to issue up to 5,000,000 shares of preferred stock in one or more series. The Companys board of directors may designate the rights, preferences, privileges and restrictions of the preferred stock, including dividend rights, conversion rights, voting rights, terms of redemption, liquidation preference, sinking fund terms, and number of shares constituting any series or the designation of any series. The issuance of preferred stock could have the effect of restricting dividends on the Companys common stock, diluting the voting power of its common stock, impairing the liquidation rights of its common stock, or delaying or preventing a change in control. The ability to issue preferred stock could delay or impede a change in control. As of January 31, 2018 and 2017 , no shares of preferred stock were outstanding. 11.

In fiscal 2016, the Company recorded excess tax benefits of $59.5 million directly to stockholders' equity. In fiscal 2018, the Company recorded tax expense primarily from profitable jurisdictions outside of the United States. In fiscal 2017, the Company recorded a net tax benefit of $154.2 million . The most significant component of this tax amount was the benefit of $210.3 million resulting from a partial release of its valuation allowance in connection with the acquisition of Demandware. The net deferred tax liability from acquisitions provided an additional source of income to support the realizability of the Company's pre-existing deferred tax assets and as a result, the Company released a portion of its valuation allowance. The tax benefit associated with the release of the valuation allowance was partially offset by income taxes in profitable jurisdictions outside the United States. In addition, as a result of adopting ASU 2016-09 and the Company's valuation allowance, it did not record significant current tax expense for the United States. In fiscal 2016, the Company recorded income taxes in profitable jurisdictions outside the United States and current tax expense in the United States. The Company had U.S. current tax expense as a result of taxable income before considering certain excess tax benefits from stock options and vesting of restricted stock prior to the adoption of ASU 2016-09. A reconciliation of income taxes at the statutory federal income tax rate to the provision for (benefit from) income taxes included in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations is as follows (in thousands): ##TABLE_START  Fiscal Year Ended January 31,    U.S. federal taxes at statutory rate (1) $ 68,313  $ 8,884  $ 22,498 State, net of the federal benefit (10,769 )   (5,260 ) Foreign taxes in excess of the U.S. statutory rate (2) (34,809 )  61,912  (25,780 ) Change in valuation allowance 39,317  (128,797 )  139,565 Tax credits (107,260 )  (50,216 )  (48,943 ) Non-deductible expenses 52,636  47,836  26,841 Tax expense from acquisitions 1,137   1,584 Excess tax benefits related to shared based compensation (3) (135,237 )  (95,030 )  Effect of U.S. tax law change 206,885   Other, net (5,583 )  (244 )  1,200 Provision for (benefit from) income taxes $ 74,630  $ (154,249 )  $ 111,705 ##TABLE_END (1) The Company revised its statutory rate from 35.0 percent to 33.8 percent for fiscal 2018 to reflect the corporate tax rate reduction effective January 1, 2018 due to the Tax Act. (2) In fiscal 2016, the Company amended its inter-company cost-sharing arrangement to exclude stock-based compensation as a result of the U.S. Tax Court's opinion in Altera Corporation's (\"Altera\") litigation with the IRS, and accordingly, recorded a tax benefit subject to the valuation allowance. Most of the Altera related tax benefits were reflected in the foreign taxes in excess of the U.S. statutory rate in fiscal 2016, which were partially offset by a change in valuation allowance. In fiscal 2018, the benefit resulted from higher foreign tax credits, which were offset by the valuation allowance. (3) Starting fiscal 2017, the excess tax benefits resulting from the vesting or the settlement of the stock awards were recorded in the tax provision, which were offset by the valuation allowance in the U.S. jurisdiction. In December 2017, the Tax Act was enacted into law, significantly changing income tax law that affects U.S. corporations. Key changes included a corporate tax rate reduction from 35 percent to 21 percent effective January 1, 2018, expensing of certain qualified property, significant changes to the U.S international tax system such as a one-time transition tax on accumulated foreign earnings, and how foreign earnings are subject to U.S. tax. Due to the timing of the Tax Act and additional guidance and interpretations that may be issued in the future, the Company has not completed its analysis of the effects of the Tax Act. However, for the period ended January 31, 2018, the Company recorded a provisional tax expense of $206.9 million associated with the re-measurement of deferred taxes for the corporate rate reduction, which was offset by a reduction in valuation allowance of $216.8 million . Accordingly, an insignificant provisional benefit was recorded. Based on the Company's provisional assessment, the transition tax had no impact to its income tax provision. The provisional estimates will be adjusted during the measurement period defined under SAB 118, based upon the Company's ongoing analysis of its data and tax positions along with new guidance from regulators and interpretations of the law. The Company received certain tax incentives in Singapore in the form of reduced tax rates, which will expire in fiscal 2020. Deferred Income Taxes Deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effect of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes. The Company recorded a provisional adjustment to its U.S. deferred income taxes as of January 31, 2018 to reflect the reduction in the corporate tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent resulting from the Tax Act. Significant components of the Companys deferred tax assets and liabilities were as follows (in thousands): ##TABLE_START  As of January 31,   Deferred tax assets:    Net operating loss carryforwards $ 617,370  $ 1,018,080 Deferred stock-based expense 78,706  133,921 Tax credits 496,695  240,925 Deferred rent expense 59,159  65,779 Accrued liabilities 113,182  141,008 Basis difference on strategic and other investments 41,441  42,034 Financing obligation 96,952  140,539 Deferred cost sharing adjustment 19,511  30,351 Non-cash equity liability  26,155 Other 14,382  21,432 Total deferred tax assets 1,537,398  1,860,224 Less valuation allowance (974,706 )  (948,386 ) Deferred tax assets, net of valuation allowance 562,692  911,838 Deferred tax liabilities:    Deferred commissions (137,479 )  (139,641 ) Purchased intangibles (204,678 )  (408,203 ) Unrealized gains on investments (5,093 )  (8,547 ) Depreciation and amortization (166,382 )  (251,782 ) Deferred revenue (37,435 )  (98,997 ) Total deferred tax liabilities (551,067 )  (907,170 ) Net deferred tax assets $ 11,625  $ 4,668 ##TABLE_ENDAt January 31, 2018 , for federal income tax purposes, the Company had net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $2.7 billion , which expire in fiscal 2021 through fiscal 2038, federal research and development tax credits of approximately $274.5 million , which expire in fiscal 2020 through fiscal 2038, foreign tax credits of approximately $118.5 million , which expire in fiscal 2019 through fiscal 2028, and alternative minimum tax credits of $0.8 million , which the Company expects to receive as a refund under the Tax Act. For California income tax purposes, the Company had net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $847.5 million which expire beginning in fis cal 2019 through fiscal 2039, Ca lifornia research and development tax credits of approximately $215.1 million , which do not expire, and  $8.8 million of enterprise zone tax credits, which expire in fiscal 2025. For other states income tax purposes, the Company had net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $1.2 billion which expire beginning in fiscal 2019 through fiscal 2037 and tax credits of approximately $27.1 million , which expire beginning in fiscal 2021 through fiscal 2033. Utilization of the Companys net operating loss carryforwards may be subject to substantial annual limitation due to the ownership change limitations provided by the Internal Revenue Code and similar state provisions. Such an annual limitation could result in the expiration of the net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards before utilization. The Company regularly assesses the realizability of its deferred tax assets and establishes a valuation allowance if it is more-likely-than-not that some or all of its deferred tax assets will not be realized. The Company evaluates and weighs all available positive and negative evidence such as historic results, future reversals of existing deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income, as well as prudent and feasible tax-planning strategies. The Company will continue to assess the realizability of the deferred tax assets in each of the applicable jurisdictions going forward. The Company may release all or a portion of its valuation allowance if there is sufficient positive evidence that outweighs the negative evidence, for example, if the trend in profitability continues. Tax Benefits Related to Stock-Based Compensation The income tax benefit related to stock-based compensation was $264.9 million , $228.8 million and 180.2 million for fiscal 2018 , 2017 and 2016 , respectively, the majority of which was not recognized as a result of the valuation allowance. Unrecognized Tax Benefits and Other Considerations The Company records liabilities related to its uncertain tax positions. Tax positions for the Company and its subsidiaries are subject to income tax audits by multiple tax jurisdictions throughout the world. The Company recognizes the tax benefit of an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the position is sustainable upon examination by the taxing authority, based on the technical merits. The tax benefit recognized is measured as the largest amount of benefit which is greater than 50 percent likely to be realized upon settlement with the taxing authority. The Company had gross unrecognized tax benefits of $304.0 million , $231.3 million , and $172.7 million as of January 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016 respectively. A reconciliation of the beginning and ending balance of total unrecognized tax benefits for fiscal years 2018 , 2017 and 2016 is as follows (in thousands): ##TABLE_START  Fiscal Year Ended January 31,    Beginning of period $ 231,317  $ 172,741  $ 146,188 Tax positions taken in prior period:      Gross increases 31,347  18,254  7,456 Gross decreases (6,364 )  (1,131 )  (7,264 ) Tax positions taken in current period:      Gross increases 50,405  57,872  38,978 Settlements (615 )  (15,598 )  (8,684 ) Lapse of statute of limitations (8,193 )  (1,261 )  (781 ) Currency translation effect 6,054   (3,152 ) End of period $ 303,951  $ 231,317  $ 172,741 ##TABLE_ENDFor fiscal 2018 , 2017 and 2016 total unrecognized tax benefits in an amount of $77.2 million , $73.0 million and $56.2 million , respectively, if recognized, would reduce income tax expense and the Companys effective tax rate after considering the impact of the change in valuation allowance in the U.S. The Company recognizes accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in the income tax provision. The Company recorded an immaterial amount for penalties and interest for each of fiscal 2018 , 2017 and 2016 . The balance in the non-current income tax payable related to penalties and interest was $6.3 million , $6.7 million and $6.3 million as of January 31, 2018 , 2017 and 2016 , respectively. Certain prior year tax returns are currently being examined by various taxing authorities in countries including the United States, France, United Kingdom and Germany. In March 2017, the Company received the final notice of proposed adjustments primarily related to transfer pricing issues from the IRS for fiscal 2011 and fiscal 2012. Accordingly, the Company re-assessed and adjusted its reserves, which resulted in a net immaterial impact to the tax provision due to its valuation allowance. The Company is currently appealing the IRS proposed adjustments. The Company believes that it has provided adequate reserves for its income tax uncertainties in all open tax years. As the outcome of the tax audits cannot be predicted with certainty, if any issues addressed in the Company's tax audits are resolved in a manner inconsistent with management's expectations, the Company could adjust its provision for income taxes in the future. Generally, any adjustments resulting from the U.S. audits should not have a significant impact to the Company's tax provision due to its valuation allowance. The Company has operations and taxable presence in multiple jurisdictions in the U.S. and outside of the U.S. Tax positions for the Company and its subsidiaries are subject to income tax audits by multiple tax jurisdictions around the world. The Company currently considers U.S. federal and state, Canada, Japan, Australia, Germany, France and the United Kingdom to be major tax jurisdictions. The Companys U.S. federal and state tax returns since February 1999, which was the inception of the Company, remain open to examination. With some exceptions, tax years prior to fiscal 2011 in jurisdictions outside of U.S. are generally closed. However, in Japan and United Kingdom, the Company is no longer subject to examinations for years prior to fiscal 2014 and fiscal 2015, respectively. The Company anticipates it is reasonably possible that a decrease of unrecognized tax benefits up to approximately $7.5 million may occur in the next 12 months, as the applicable statutes of limitations lapse. 12. Earnings (Loss) Per Share Basic earnings/loss per share is computed by dividing net income by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding for the fiscal period. Diluted earnings per share is computed by giving effect to all potential weighted average dilutive common stock, including options, restricted stock units, warrants and the convertible senior notes. The dilutive effect of outstanding awards and convertible securities is reflected in diluted earnings per share by application of the treasury stock method. Diluted loss per share for fiscal 2016 is the same as basic loss per share as there was a net loss in fiscal 2016, and inclusion of potentially issuable shares was anti-dilutive. A reconciliation of the denominator used in the calculation of basic and diluted earnings per share is as follows (in thousands): ##TABLE_START  Fiscal Year Ended January 31,    Numerator:      Net income (loss) $ 127,478  $ 179,632  $ (47,426 ) Denominator:      Weighted-average shares outstanding for basic earnings (loss) per share 714,919  687,797  661,647 Effect of dilutive securities:      Convertible senior notes 4,672  1,906  Employee stock awards 14,163  10,514  Warrants   Adjusted weighted-average shares outstanding and assumed conversions for diluted earnings (loss) per share 734,598  700,217  661,647 ##TABLE_ENDThe weighted-average number of shares outstanding used in the computation of diluted earnings per share does not include the effect of the following potential outstanding common stock. The effects of these potentially outstanding shares were not included in the calculation of diluted earnings per share because the effect would have been anti-dilutive (in thousands): ##TABLE_START  Fiscal Year Ended January 31,    Employee stock awards 7,210  10,527  26,615 Convertible senior notes   17,309 Warrants  17,309  17,309 ##TABLE_END13. Commitments Letters of Credit As of January 31, 2018 , the Company had a total of $99.9 million in letters of credit outstanding substantially in favor of certain landlords for office space. These letters of credit renew annually and expire at various dates through December 2030.  Leases The Company leases facilities space and certain fixed assets under non-cancelable operating and capital leases with various expiration dates. As of January 31, 2018 , the future minimum lease payments under non-cancelable operating and capital leases are as follows (in thousands): ##TABLE_START  Capital Leases  Operating Leases  Financing Obligation -Leased Facility (1) Fiscal Period:      Fiscal 2019 $ 115,909  $ 610,925  $ 21,881 Fiscal 2020 201,618  540,391  22,325 Fiscal 2021  400,738  22,770 Fiscal 2022  298,641  23,214 Fiscal 2023  277,032  23,658 Thereafter  1,155,600  187,055 Total minimum lease payments 317,645  $ 3,283,327  $ 300,903 Less: amount representing interest (22,328 )   Present value of capital lease obligations $ 295,317   ##TABLE_END(1) Total Financing Obligation - Leased Facility noted above represents the total obligation on the lease agreement including amounts allocated to interest and the implied lease for the land as noted in Note 5 Property and Equipment. As of January 31, 2018 , $218.2 million of the total $300.9 million above was recorded to Financing obligation leased facility, of which the current portion is included in \"Accounts payable, accrued expenses and other liabilities\" and the noncurrent portion is included in Other noncurrent liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets. The Companys agreements for the facilities and certain services provide the Company with the option to renew. The Companys future contractual obligations would change if the Company exercised these options. The terms of the lease agreements provide for rental payments on a graduated basis. The Company recognizes rent expense on a straight-line basis over the lease period and has accrued for rent expense incurred but not paid. Of the total operating lease commitment balance of $3.3 billion , approximately $2.7 billion is related to facilities space. The remaining commitment amount is related to computer equipment and furniture and fixtures. Rent expense for fiscal 2018 , 2017 and 2016 was $285.2 million , $226.0 million and $174.6 million , respectively. Other Purchase Commitments In April 2016, the Company entered into an agreement with a third-party provider for certain infrastructure services for a period of four years . The Company paid $96.0 million in connection with this agreement during fiscal 2018 . The agreement further provides that the Company will pay an additional $108.0 million in fiscal 2019 and $126.0 million in fiscal 2020. 14. Employee Benefit Plan The Company has a 401(k) plan covering all eligible employees in the United States and a Registered Retirement Savings plan covering all eligible employees in Canada. Since January 1, 2006, the Company has been contributing to the plans. Total Company contributions during fiscal 2018 , 2017 and 2016 , were $93.2 million , $56.4 million and $45.6 million , respectively. 15. Legal Proceedings and Claims In the ordinary course of business, the Company is or may be involved in various legal proceedings and claims related to alleged infringement of third-party patents and other intellectual property rights, commercial, corporate and securities, labor and employment, class actions, wage and hour, and other claims. The Company has been, and may in the future be put on notice and/or sued by third-parties for alleged infringement of their proprietary rights, including patent infringement. In general, the resolution of a legal matter could prevent the Company from offering its service to others, could be material to the Companys financial condition or cash flows, or both, or could otherwise adversely affect the Companys operating results. The Company makes a provision for a liability relating to legal matters when it is both probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. These provisions are reviewed at least quarterly and adjusted to reflect the impacts of negotiations, estimated settlements, legal rulings, advice of legal counsel and other information and events pertaining to a particular matter. The outcomes of legal proceedings and other contingencies are, however, inherently unpredictable and subject to significant uncertainties. As a result, the Company is not able to reasonably estimate the amount or range of possible losses in excess of any amounts accrued, including losses that could arise as a result of application of non- monetary remedies, with respect to the contingencies it faces, and the Companys estimates may not prove to be accurate. In managements opinion, resolution of all current matters is not expected to have a material adverse impact on the Companys consolidated results of operations, cash flows or financial position. However, depending on the nature and timing of any such dispute, an unfavorable resolution of a matter could materially affect the Companys current or future results of operations or cash flows, or both, in a particular quarter. In September 2013, one of the Companys subsidiaries, ExactTarget, Inc. (ExactTarget), was added as a defendant in a purported class-action lawsuit that alleged that ExactTarget and one of its customers, Simply Fashion Stores, Ltd. (Simply Fashion), violated the Telephone Consumer Protection Act (TCPA) as a result of Simply Fashions text messaging campaigns and alleged failure to opt-out certain Simply Fashion customers from receiving messages. The complaint was subsequently amended to remove Simply Fashion as a defendant and the lawsuit is currently before the United States District Court for the Southern District of Indiana. The complaint seeks statutory damages and injunctive relief. While disputing the allegations of wrongdoing, the Company has reached a settlement of the lawsuit for approximately $6.3 million . The parties submitted the settlement agreement to the Court for approval and the Court entered the preliminary approval order. The Court set the final approval hearing for July 20, 2018. 16. Related-Party Transactions In January 1999, the Salesforce.com Foundation, also referred to as the Foundation, was chartered on an idea of leveraging the Companys people, technology, and resources to help improve communities around the world. The Company calls this integrated philanthropic approach the 1-1-1 model. Beginning in 2008, Salesforce.org, which is a non-profit public benefit corporation, was established to resell the Company's services to nonprofit organizations and certain higher education organizations. The Companys Chairman is the chairman of both the Foundation and Salesforce.org. The Companys Chairman holds one of the three Foundation board seats. The Companys Chairman, one of the Companys employees and one of the Companys board members hold three of Salesforce.orgs nine board seats. The Company does not control the Foundations or Salesforce.org's activities, and accordingly, the Company does not consolidate either of the related entities' statement of activities with its financial results. Since the Foundations and Salesforce.orgs inception, the Company has provided at no charge certain resources to those entities' employees such as office space, furniture, equipment, facilities, services, and other resources. The value of these items was approximately $11.2 million , $3.3 million and $1.2 million for fiscal 2018 , 2017 and 2016 , respectively. Additionally, the Company allows Salesforce.org to donate subscriptions of the Companys services to other qualified non-profit organizations. The Company also allows Salesforce.org to resell the Companys service to non-profit organizations and certain education entities. The Company does not charge Salesforce.org for these subscriptions, therefore income from subscriptions sold to non-profit organizations is donated back to the community through charitable grants made by the Foundation and Salesforce.org. The value of the subscriptions sold by Salesforce.org pursuant to the reseller agreement, as amended, was approximately $182.6 million , $112.4 million and $69.9 million for fiscal 2018 , 2017 and 2016 , respectively. As described in Note 6 Business Combinations, the Company's Chairman held an ownership interest in an acquisition that was completed by the Company in April 2016. 17. Subsequent events In March 2018, Salesforce Ventures, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, entered into an agreement to make a strategic investment, through a private placement, in a late stage technology company. The Company had initially invested $5.0 million in this company in fiscal 2015 and the agreement provides that the Company will invest an additional $100.0 million in this company, subject to certain contingencies. This investment is expected to occur in the Company's first quarter of fiscal 2019, and will be one of the Companys largest strategic investments to date. The Company expects its ownership interest after this investment to be less than five percent of the investee companys outstanding shares. 18.

CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES ##TABLE_END (a) Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act), as of the end of the period covered by this report. In designing and evaluating our disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any disclosure controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. In addition, the design of disclosure controls and procedures must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and that management is required to apply its judgment in evaluating the benefits of possible controls and procedures relative to their costs. Based on managements evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are designed to, and are effective to, provide assurance at a reasonable level that the information we are required to disclose in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in Securities and Exchange Commission rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. (b) Managements Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f). Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of January 31, 2018 based on the guidelines established in the Internal ControlIntegrated Framework (2013 framework) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). Our internal control over financial reporting includes policies and procedures that provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external reporting purposes in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Based on the results of our evaluation, our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of January 31, 2018 . We reviewed the results of managements assessment with our Audit Committee. The effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of January 31, 2018 has been audited by Ernst  Young LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in its report which is included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. (c) Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting There was no change in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended January 31, 2018 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. (d) Inherent Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls Our management, including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, do not expect that our disclosure controls or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the Company have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty, and that breakdowns can occur because of a simple error or mistake. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people or by management override of the controls. The design of any system of controls is also based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions; over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or the degree of compliance with policies or procedures may deteriorate. Because of the inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected. ##TABLE_START ", "9B": " ITEM 9B.

BUSINESS Overview Salesforce is a global leader in customer relationship management (CRM) technology that enables companies to improve their relationships and interactions with customers. Founded in 1999, Salesforce empowers companies of every size and industry to connect with their customers in new ways through existing and emerging technologies, including cloud, mobile, social, Internet of Things (IoT) and artificial intelligence (AI), to grow their business and work more productively. The Salesforce Customer Success Platform delivers services spanning sales, service, marketing, commerce, engagement, integration, analytics, industries, communities, enablement and collaboration, most of which operate on a single trusted cloud platform. Our service offerings are designed to be intuitive and easy to use. They can be deployed quickly via mobile devices and major internet browsers, configured easily, and integrated with other platforms and enterprise applications. We sell to businesses worldwide primarily on a subscription basis, through our direct sales efforts and also indirectly through partners. Through our platform and other developer tools, we also enable third parties to develop additional functionality and new applications, or apps, that run on our platform, which are sold separately fromor in conjunction withour service offerings. Salesforce operates based on a core set of values: trust, customer success, innovation and equality. Foremost among these is trust, which is the foundation for everything we do. Our customers trust our technology to deliver the highest levels of security, reliability and availability at scale. We believe our continuous innovation and the democratization of both technology and innovation drives customer success, which in turn drives mutual growth. In addition, we have spearheaded initiatives that foster a culture of equal pay, equal advancement, equal opportunity and equal rights for our more than 35,000 employees as a leading example for the broader world. We believe the business of business is improving the state of the world for all of our stakeholders, including our stockholders, our customers, our employees, the environment and the communities in which we work and live. Salesforce is committed to transparent environmental, social and governance disclosures and maintaining programs that support the success of these initiatives. Refer to our \"Environmental, Social and Governance\" discussion in Part II, Item 7 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, which is incorporated herein by reference. We were incorporated in Delaware in February 1999. Our principal executive offices are located in San Francisco, California. Our principal address is Salesforce Tower, 415 Mission St, 3rd Floor, San Francisco, California 94105, and our primary website address is www.salesforce.com. Our Service Offerings Our cloud service offerings are as follows: Sales Cloud. Sales Cloud empowers sales teams of companies of every size and industry to sell faster, smarter and in the way they want. Our customers use Sales Cloud to store data, monitor leads and progress, forecast opportunities, gain insights through analytics and relationship intelligence, and deliver quotes, contracts and invoices. Service Cloud. Service Cloud enables companies to deliver smarter, faster and more personalized customer service and support. Our customers use Service Cloud to connect their service agents with customers anytime and anywhere, on popular devices and across multiple channels: phone, email, messaging, chat, live video, SMS, self-service web portals, social networks, online communities and directly within their own products and mobile apps. In addition, Service Cloud offers a field service solution that enables companies to connect agents, dispatchers and mobile employees through one centralized platform, on which they can schedule and dispatch work intelligently, and track and manage jobs in real-time. Marketing and Commerce Cloud. Marketing Cloud enables companies to plan, personalize and optimize one-to-one customer marketing journeys, including interactions across email, mobile, social, web and connected products. In addition, companies can segment and target audiences to power precise digital marketing at scale. With Marketing Cloud, customer data can also be integrated with Sales Cloud and Service Cloud in the form of leads, contacts and customer service cases to give companies a complete view of their customers. Our Commerce Cloud empowers brands to unify the customer experience across all points of commerce, including mobile, web, social and store. With embedded AI that delivers a personalized shopping experience and a robust partner ecosystem, Commerce Cloud helps companies drive increased engagement, conversion, revenue and loyalty from their customers. Salesforce Platform and Other. The Salesforce Platform includes: Lightning Platform.  Lightning Platform empowers Information Technology (IT), developers and business users with the industry's leading no-code to pro-code Platform-as-a-Service tools for building, securing, integrating and managing the business apps that power today's customer experiences. With the Lightning Platform, enterprises drive digital transformation at scale by building applications for any business need. Lightning Platform includes complete, intelligent analytics capabilities so customers can explore their business data, uncover new insights, make smarter decisions and take action from any device. Lightning Platform also includes Trailhead for Enablement, our free, gamified, interactive online learning platform that allows anyone to learn in-demand Salesforce skills, including administering our services and developing on the Salesforce Platform. Lightning Platform also includes our Heroku Engagement Platform, which enables developers to build, run and operate applications entirely in the cloud. Integration.  MuleSoft Anypoint Platform enables our customers to connect any system, application, data or device, whether in the cloud or on-premises, on a unified platform using application networks instead of inflexible custom code. By unlocking data across their enterprise, our customers can create new revenue opportunities, increase operational efficiency and create differentiated customer experiences. Collaboration. Quip Collaboration Platform combines documents, spreadsheets, apps, and chat with live CRM data to deliver a central hub for teams to create, collaborate and get work done. Built mobile-first, Quip breaks down communication barriers and silos to enable every business to collaborate online, offline and from almost any device. Most of our service offerings operate on a single customer success platform and are deployed in an identical way even though we have offerings in multiple enterprise cloud computing markets, including as a result of our acquisitions. Our core offerings are suited to meet the needs of our customers in certain industries, such as solutions for financial services, healthcare and government. Additionally, our core offerings enable companies to quickly create and manage trusted, branded digital destinations for customers, partners and employees, collectively referred to as community management. This allows companies to engage and collaborate directly with groups of people by giving them access to relevant information, apps and experts. Additionally, through Salesforce Customer 360, our new cross-cloud technology initiative that enhances the integration of our Marketing, Commerce, and Service clouds, we will enable companies to connect their customer data across the various offerings and deliver a unified customer experience. Customer 360 is designed to help companies move beyond an app- or department-specific view of each customer by making it easier to create a single, holistic customer profile to inform every interaction. Business Benefits of Using Our Solution The key advantages of our solutions include the following: ##TABLE_START  A multi-tenant application architecture designed to enable our service offerings to scale securely, reliably and cost effectively. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Rapid deployment and lower total cost of ownership with multiple releases per year deployed automatically with new features and functionality. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Ease of integration and configuration with application programming interfaces that enable customers to integrate our solutions with existing third-party, custom and legacy apps, as well as write their own application services that integrate with our solutions. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Solutions designed to be intuitive and easy to use with minimal training. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Rapid development of apps without having to invest in hardware by providing infrastructure and development environments on demand. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Continuous innovation through our Ideas Exchange, which is a forum to provide feedback and suggest new features for future service releases. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Positive environmental impact with our multi-tenant cloud computing model that has a smaller environmental footprint than traditional hardware and software. ##TABLE_END Our Growth Strategy We invest for future growth by focusing on the following key priorities: Cross selling and upselling. We see significant opportunity to deepen our relationships with our existing customers. As our customers realize the benefits of our service offerings, we aim to upgrade the customer experience with premium editions and additional subscriptions by targeting new functional areas and business units, with the goal of ultimately becoming our customers' trusted advisors, inspiring enterprise-wide digital transformation and accelerating strategic engagements through direct discussions with the highest levels of our customers' executive management. Extending existing service offerings. We offer multiple editions of our cloud service offerings at different price points to meet the needs of customers of different sizes and we have designed our solutions to accommodate new features and functionality. We intend to continue to expand all editions of our service offerings with new features, functions and increased security through our own development, acquisitions and partnerships. We have invested heavily in the AI capabilities of Einstein, which allows users of our products to deliver more predictive customer experiences, as well as innovations like Lightning and Trailhead that improve the entire platform. Reducing customer attrition. We strive to reduce attrition and secure renewals of existing customer subscriptions prior to the end of their contractual terms with us through, among other things, customer success and other related programs. Expanding and strengthening the partner ecosystem. We continue to work with and invest in strategic system integrators (SIs) and independent software vendors (ISVs) to accelerate our reach into new markets and industries, offer a variety of solutions natively and through the AppExchange, our enterprise cloud marketplace, and address the business requirements of both current and future customers. International expansion. We continue to increase our investment in our international go-to-market resources, operations and infrastructure to deliver the highest quality service to our customers around the world. Targeting vertical industries. To meet the needs of our customers in certain industries, we provide solutions specifically built for certain vertical industries, such as financial services, healthcare and government. Expanding into new horizontal markets. As part of our growth strategy, which is driven both organically and through acquisitions, we are delivering innovative solutions in new categories, including analytics, commerce, IoT and integration, and expect to continue this type of horizontal expansion in the future. Extending go-to-market capabilities. We believe that our offerings provide significant value for businesses of any size. We will continue to pursue businesses of all sizes in top industries and major regions globally, primarily through our direct sales force. We have steadily increased and plan to continue to increase the number of direct sales professionals we employ, and we intend to develop additional distribution channels for our solutions around the globe. Promoting strong customer adoption. We believe that we have the people, processes and proven innovation to help companies transform successfully. We have free, curated resources such as Trailhead to help companies of every size learn our systems, as well as advisory services, technical architects and business strategists to enable and accelerate digital transformation. Encouraging the development of third-party applications on our cloud computing platform. The Lightning Platform enables customers, ISVs and third-party developers to create and deliver cloud-based apps. It is a platform on which apps can be created, tested, published and run. In addition, these apps can be marketed and sold on the AppExchange or sold directly by software vendors. We believe our ecosystem of developers and software vendors will help address the business requirements of both current and future customers. In addition to the key elements of our growth strategy described above, from time to time, we evaluate opportunities to acquire or invest in complementary businesses, services, technologies and intellectual property rights. These evaluations resulted in our acquisition of several companies in fiscal 2019, including MuleSoft, Inc. (\"MuleSoft\") and Datorama, Inc. (\"Datorama\") which expanded our integration and marketing capabilities. Technology, Development and Operations We deliver our Salesforce solutions as highly scalable, cloud computing application and platform services on a multi-tenant technology architecture. We also offer integration capabilities in the cloud, as well as on-premises, to provide our customers more options to integrate their data. Multi-tenancy is an architectural approach that allows us to operate a single application instance for multiple organizations, treating all customers as separate tenants who run in virtual isolation from each other. This approach allows us to spread the cost of delivering our services across our user base and scale our business faster than traditional software vendors while focusing our resources on building new functionality. We provide the majority of our services to our customers from infrastructure designed and operated by us but secured within third-party data center facilities located in the United States, United Kingdom, Germany, France, Japan and other countries. These third-party data center operators provide space, physical security, and continuous power and cooling. In combination with these third-party data center facilities, we also run our services on cloud computing platform partners who offer Infrastructure-as-a-Service, including servers, storage, databases and networking. The use of cloud computing platform partners provides us flexibility to service customers in new and emerging regions and those with in-country data privacy requirements, as well as to support acquired companies. Our technology and product efforts are focused on improving and enhancing the features, functionality, performance, availability and security of our existing service offerings, as well as developing new features, functionality and services and integrating businesses, services and technologies from acquisitions. Performance, functional depth, security and the usability of our solutions influence our technology decisions and product direction. Competition The market for our service offerings is highly competitive, rapidly evolving and fragmented, and subject to changing technology and low barriers to entry, shifting customer needs and frequent introductions of new products and services. Our current competitors include: ##TABLE_START  Vendors of packaged business software, as well as companies offering enterprise apps delivered through on-premises offerings from enterprise software application vendors and cloud computing application service providers, either individually or with others; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Internally developed enterprise applications (by our potential customers IT departments); ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Software companies that provide their product or service free of charge, and only charge a premium for advanced features and functionality; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Marketing vendors, which may be specialized in advertising, targeting, messaging, or campaign automation; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  E-commerce solutions from established and emerging cloud-only vendors and established on-premises vendors; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Traditional platform development environment companies and cloud computing development platform companies who may develop toolsets and products that allow customers to build new apps that run on the customers current infrastructure or as hosted services; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  IoT platforms from large companies that have existing relationships with hardware and software companies; and ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  AI solutions from new startups and established companies. ##TABLE_END We believe more traditional enterprise software application and platform vendors may become a greater competitive threat as they shift more of their focus to cloud computing. Sources of Revenue For revenue reporting purposes, we group all of our service offerings into four major categories: Sales Cloud, Service Cloud, Salesforce Platform and Other, and Marketing and Commerce Cloud. Our subscription and support revenues are disaggregated into these four core offerings. For a more detailed discussion, see the Revenue by Cloud Service Offering discussion in Managements Discussion and Analysis. We derive our revenues primarily from subscription revenues from our enterprise cloud computing services, software licenses and support fees for our services. We also derive revenues from related professional services via our Customer Success Group. For our subscription and support offerings, we recognize subscription and support revenue ratably over the contract term, beginning on the commencement date of each contract. For software license sales, which resulted from our May 2018 acquisition of MuleSoft, revenues are generally recognized upfront when the software is made available to the customer. We enter into professional services contracts that are on a time and materials, fixed fee or subscription basis. We recognize revenue over time as the services are rendered for time and materials contracts, on a proportional performance basis for fixed price contracts and ratably over the contract term for subscription professional services. Amounts that have been invoiced are recorded in accounts receivable and in either unearned revenue or revenue, depending on whether the revenue recognition criteria have been met. Unearned revenue primarily consists of billings or payments received in advance of revenue recognition from subscription services and is recognized as the revenue recognition criteria are met. Remaining performance obligations, representing future revenues that are under contract but have not yet been recognized, are not recorded in unearned revenue. We generally invoice customers annually. Typical payment terms provide that our customers pay us within 30 days of invoice. Unearned revenue and remaining performance obligation are influenced by several factors, including new business seasonality within the year, the specific timing, size and duration of large customer subscription agreements, the timing and compounding effects of customer renewals, varying billing cycles of subscription agreements, invoice timing, foreign currency fluctuations and new business linearity. Our fourth quarter has historically been our strongest quarter for new business and renewals, and our first quarter is generally our largest collections and operating cash flow quarter. For a more detailed discussion, see the Seasonal Nature of Unearned Revenue, Accounts Receivable and Operating Cash Flow discussion in Managements Discussion and Analysis. Refer to our \"Liquidity and Capital Resources\" discussion in Part II, Item 7 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, which is incorporated herein by reference. Customers We sell to businesses of all sizes and in almost every industry worldwide. The number of paying subscriptions at each of our customers ranges from one to hundreds of thousands. None of our customers accounted for more than five percent of our revenues in fiscal 2019, 2018 or 2017. Customer Service and Support We offer professional services to help customers achieve business results faster with Salesforce solutions. Our architects and innovation program teams act as advisors to plan and execute digital transformations for our customers. We provide best-practices based support and adoption programs globally. In addition, we provide more advanced education, including instructor-led and online courses to certify our customers and partners on architecting, administering, deploying and developing our service offerings. Our global customer support group responds to both business and technical inquiries about the use of our products via the web, telephone, email, social networks and other channels. We provide standard customer support during regular business hours at no charge to customers who purchase any of our paying subscription editions. We also offer premier customer support that is either included in a premium offering or sold for an additional fee, which can include services such as priority access to technical resources, developer support, and system administration. In addition, we offer a mission critical support add-on that is designed to provide customers with responses for incidents from a dedicated team knowledgeable about the customer's specific enterprise architecture, and which offers instruction to optimize their usage of our products. Sales and Marketing We sell our services primarily through our direct sales force, which is comprised of telephone sales personnel based in regional hubs, and field sales personnel based in territories close to their customers. Both our telephone sales and field sales personnel are supported by sales representatives, who are primarily responsible for generating qualified sales leads. To a lesser extent, we also have a network of partners who refer sales leads to us and who then assist in selling to these prospects. This network includes global consulting firms, systems integrators and other partners. In return, we typically pay these partners a fee based on the first-year subscription revenue generated by the customers whom they refer. We continue to invest in developing additional distribution channels for our subscription service. Our marketing strategy is to promote our brand and generate demand for our offerings. We use a variety of marketing programs across traditional and social channels to target our prospective and current customers, partners and developers. We focus our marketing activities on the cities and countries with the largest market opportunity. Our primary marketing activities include:  Multi-channel marketing campaigns that span email, social, web and more, which align to a broader customer journey;  Customer events of all sizes to create customer and prospect awareness, including proprietary events such as Dreamforce and World Tours, as well as participation in trade shows and industry events;  Press and industry analyst relations to garner third-party validation and generate positive coverage for our company, service offerings and value proposition;  Content marketing and engagement on all of the major social channels;  Search engine marketing and advertising to drive traffic to our web properties;  Partner co-marketing activities with global and regional implementation partners;  Web site development to engage and educate prospects and generate interest through product information and demonstrations, case studies, white papers and marketing collateral;  Customer testimonials;  Cultivating a community of Trailblazers who embrace our Company values and evangelize our service offerings. A Trailblazer can be anyone who leverages new technologies to transform their companies, careers and communities;  Tools that enable our sales organization to more effectively convert leads into customers;  Event sponsorships; and  Primary real estate signage. We organize our sales and marketing programs by geographic regions, such as the Americas, Europe and Asia Pacific, which includes Japan. Strategic Investments We invest in early- to late-stage technology and professional cloud service companies across the globe to support our business initiatives, which include, among other things, extending the capabilities of our platform and service offerings, increasing the ecosystem of enterprise cloud companies and partners, accelerating the adoption of cloud technologies and creating the next-generation of AI, mobile applications and connected products. Our minority investments in over 240 companies as of January 31, 2019 also help us stay connected with the rapid pace of innovation that is currently occurring within the technology industry. In some cases, we have acquired companies in which we have previously invested. Due to the inherent risk in investing, our individual investments are subject to a risk of partial or total loss of investment capital. While historically our investment portfolio has had a positive impact on our financial results, that may not be true for future periods, particularly in periods of significant market fluctuations that affect the market price of publicly traded companies within our strategic investment portfolio. Intellectual Property We rely on a combination of trademarks, copyrights, trade secrets and patents, as well as contractual provisions, to protect our proprietary technology and our brands. We also enter into confidentiality and proprietary rights agreements with our employees, consultants and other third parties and control access to software, services, documentation and other proprietary information. We believe the duration of our patents is adequate relative to the expected lives of our service offerings. We also purchase or license technology that we incorporate into our products or services. At times, we make select intellectual property broadly available at no or low cost to achieve a strategic objective, such as promoting industry standards, advancing interoperability, fostering open source software or attracting and enabling our external development community. While it may be necessary in the future to seek or renew licenses relating to various aspects of our products and business methods, we believe, based upon past experience and industry practice, such licenses generally could be obtained on commercially reasonable terms. We believe our continuing research and product development are not materially dependent on any single license or other agreement with a third party relating to the development of our products. Employees As of January 31, 2019, we had more than 35,000 employees. None of our employees in the United States are represented by a labor union. However, for certain foreign subsidiaries, works councils represent our employees.

RISK FACTORS ##TABLE_END The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones facing us. Other events that we do not currently anticipate or that we currently deem immaterial also may affect our results of operations, stockholders' equity, cash flows and financial condition. Risks Related to Our Business and Industry If our security measures or those of our third-party data center hosting facilities, cloud computing platform providers or third-party service partners, or the underlying infrastructure of the internet are breached, and unauthorized access is obtained to a customers data, our data or our IT systems, or authorized access is blocked or disabled, our services may be perceived as not being secure, customers may curtail or stop using our services, and we may incur significant reputational harm, legal exposure and liabilities, or a negative financial impact. Our services involve the storage and transmission of our customers and our customers' customers' proprietary and other sensitive data, including financial information and personally identifiable information. While we have security measures in place to protect our customers and our customers customers' data, our services and underlying infrastructure may in the future be materially breached or compromised as a result of the following: ##TABLE_START  third party attempts to fraudulently induce employees or customers into disclosing sensitive information such as user names, passwords or other information to gain access to our customers data, our data or our IT systems; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  efforts by individuals or groups of hackers and sophisticated organizations, including state-sponsored organizations or nation-states; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  cyber-attacks on our internally built infrastructure on which many of our service offerings operate; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  vulnerabilities resulting from enhancements and updates to our existing service offerings; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  vulnerabilities in the products or components across the broad ecosystem that our services operate in conjunction with and are dependent on; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  vulnerabilities existing within newly acquired or integrated technologies and infrastructures; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  attacks on, or vulnerabilities in, the many different underlying networks and services that power the internet that our products depend on, most of which are not under our control or the control of our vendors, partners, or customers; and ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  employee or contractor errors or intentional acts that compromise our security systems. ##TABLE_END These risks are mitigated, to the extent possible, by our ability to maintain and improve business and data governance policies, enhanced processes and internal security controls, including our ability to escalate and respond to known and potential risks. Our Board of Directors, Audit Committee and executive management are regularly briefed on our cyber-security policies and practices and ongoing efforts to improve security, as well as periodic updates on cyber-security events. Although we have developed systems and processes designed to protect our customers and our customers customers proprietary and other sensitive data, we can provide no assurances that such measures will provide absolute security. For example, our ability to mitigate these risks may be impacted by the following: ##TABLE_START  frequent changes to, and growth in complexity of, the techniques used to breach, obtain unauthorized access to, or sabotage IT systems and infrastructure, which are generally not recognized until launched against a target, possibly resulting in our being unable to anticipate or implement adequate measures to prevent such techniques; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  the continued evolution of our internal IT systems as we early adopt new technologies and new ways of sharing data and communicating internally and with partners and customers, which increases the complexity of our IT systems; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  authorization by our customers to third-party technology providers to access their customer data, which may lead to our customers' inability to protect their data that is stored on our servers; and ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  our limited control over our customers or third-party technology providers, or the processing of data by third-party technology providers, which may not allow us to maintain the integrity or security of such transmissions or processing. ##TABLE_END In the normal course of business, we are and have been the target of malicious cyber-attack attempts and have experienced other security incidents. To date, such identified security events have not been material or significant to us, including to our reputation or business operations, or had a material financial impact, but there can be no assurance that future cyberattacks will not be material or significant. A security breach or incident could result in unauthorized parties obtaining access to, or the denial of authorized access to, our IT systems or data, or our customers' systems or data, including intellectual property, proprietary, sensitive, or other confidential information. A security breach could also result in a loss of confidence in the security of our services, damage our reputation, negatively impact our future sales, disrupt our business and lead to increases in insurance premiums and legal and financial exposure and liability. Finally, the detection, prevention and remediation of known or potential security vulnerabilities, including those arising from third-party hardware or software, may result in additional financial burdens due to additional direct and indirect costs, such as additional infrastructure capacity spending to mitigate any system degradation and the reallocation of resources from development activities. Defects or disruptions in our services could diminish demand for our services and subject us to substantial liability. Because our services are complex and incorporate a variety of hardware, proprietary software and third-party software, our services may have errors or defects that could result in unanticipated downtime for our subscribers and harm to our reputation and our business. Cloud services frequently contain undetected errors when first introduced or when new versions or enhancements are released. We have from time to time found defects in, and experienced disruptions to, our services and new defects or disruptions may occur in the future. Such defects could also create vulnerabilities that could inadvertently permit access to protected customer data. In addition, our customers may use our services in unanticipated ways that may cause a disruption in services for other customers attempting to access their data. As we acquire companies, we may encounter difficulty in incorporating the acquired technologies into our services and in augmenting the technologies to meet the quality standards that are consistent with our brand and reputation. Since our customers use our services for important aspects of their business, any errors, defects, disruptions in service or other performance problems could hurt our reputation and may damage our customers businesses. As a result, customers could elect to not renew our services or delay or withhold payment to us. We could also lose future sales or customers may make warranty or other claims against us, which could result in an increase in our allowance for doubtful accounts, an increase in collection cycles for accounts receivable or the expense and risk of litigation. Any interruptions or delays in services from third-parties, including data center hosting facilities, cloud computing platform providers and other hardware and software vendors, or our inability to adequately plan for and manage service interruptions or infrastructure capacity requirements, could impair the delivery of our services and harm our business. We currently serve our customers from third-party data center hosting facilities and cloud computing platform providers located in the United States and other countries. We also rely on computer hardware purchased or leased from, software licensed from, and cloud computing platforms provided by, third parties in order to offer our services, including database software, hardware and data from a variety of vendors. Any damage to, or failure of our systems generally, including the systems of our third-party platform providers, could result in interruptions in our services. We have from time to time experienced interruptions in our services and such interruptions may occur in the future. As we increase our reliance on these third-party systems, our exposure to damage from service interruptions may increase. Interruptions in our services may cause us to issue credits or pay penalties, cause customers to make warranty or other claims against us or to terminate their subscriptions and adversely affect our attrition rates and our ability to attract new customers, all of which would reduce our revenue. Our business would also be harmed if our customers and potential customers believe our services are unreliable. We use a range of disaster recovery and business continuity arrangements. For many of our offerings, our production environment and customers data are replicated in near real-time in a separate facility located elsewhere. Certain offerings, including some offerings of companies added through acquisitions, may be served through alternate facilities or arrangements. We do not control the operation of any of these facilities, and they may be vulnerable to damage or interruption from earthquakes, floods, fires, power loss, telecommunications failures and similar events. They may also be subject to break-ins, sabotage, intentional acts of vandalism and similar misconduct, as well as local administrative actions, changes to legal or permitting requirements and litigation to stop, limit or delay operation. Despite precautions taken at these facilities, such as disaster recovery and business continuity arrangements, the occurrence of a natural disaster or an act of terrorism, a decision to close the facilities without adequate notice or other unanticipated problems at these facilities could result in lengthy interruptions in our services. These hardware, software, data and cloud computing platforms may not continue to be available at reasonable prices, on commercially reasonable terms or at all. Any loss of the right to use any of these hardware, software or cloud computing platforms could significantly increase our expenses and otherwise result in delays in the provisioning of our services until equivalent technology is either developed by us, or, if available, is identified, obtained through purchase or license and integrated into our services. If we do not accurately plan for our infrastructure capacity requirements and we experience significant strains on our data center capacity, our customers could experience performance degradation or service outages that may subject us to financial liabilities, result in customer losses and harm our business. As we add data centers and capacity and continue to move to cloud computing platform providers, we may move or transfer our data and our customers data. Despite precautions taken during this process, any unsuccessful data transfers may impair the delivery of our services, which may damage our business. Privacy concerns and laws such as the European Unions General Data Protection Regulation, evolving regulation of cloud computing, cross-border data transfer restrictions and other domestic or foreign regulations may limit the use and adoption of our services and adversely affect our business. Regulation related to the provision of services over the Internet is evolving, as federal, state and foreign governments continue to adopt new, or modify existing, laws and regulations addressing data privacy and the collection, processing, storage, transfer and use of data. In some cases, data privacy laws and regulations, such as the European Unions (\"EU\") General Data Protection Regulation that took effect in May 2018, impose new obligations directly on Salesforce as both a data controller and a data processor, as well as on many of our customers. In addition, domestic data privacy laws, such as the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) which will take effect in January 2020, continue to evolve and could expose us to further regulatory burdens. Further, laws such as the European Unions proposed e-Privacy Regulation are increasingly aimed at the use of personal information for marketing purposes, and the tracking of individuals online activities. Although we monitor the regulatory environment and have invested in addressing these developments, such as GDPR and CCPA readiness, these laws may require us to make additional changes to our services to enable Salesforce or our customers to meet the new legal requirements, and may also increase our potential liability exposure through higher potential penalties for non-compliance. These new or proposed laws and regulations are subject to differing interpretations and may be inconsistent among jurisdictions. These and other requirements could reduce demand for our services, require us to take on more onerous obligations in our contracts, restrict our ability to store, transfer and process data or, in some cases, impact our ability or our customers' ability to offer our services in certain locations, to deploy our solutions, to reach current and prospective customers, or to derive insights from customer data globally. For example, ongoing legal challenges in Europe to the mechanisms allowing companies to transfer personal data from the European Economic Area to the United States could result in further limitations on the ability to transfer data across borders, particularly if governments are unable or unwilling to reach new or maintain existing agreements that support cross-border data transfers, such as the EU-U.S. and Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield framework. Additionally, certain countries have passed or are considering passing laws requiring local data residency. The costs of compliance with, and other burdens imposed by, privacy laws, regulations and standards may limit the use and adoption of our services, reduce overall demand for our services, make it more difficult to meet expectations from or commitments to customers, lead to significant fines, penalties or liabilities for noncompliance, impact our reputation, or slow the pace at which we close sales transactions, any of which could harm our business. In addition to government activity, privacy advocacy and other industry groups have established or may establish new self-regulatory standards that may place additional burdens on our ability to provide our services globally. Our customers expect us to meet voluntary certification and other standards established by third parties, such as TRUSTe. If we are unable to maintain these certifications or meet these standards, it could adversely affect our ability to provide our solutions to certain customers and could harm our business. Furthermore, the uncertain and shifting regulatory environment and trust climate may cause concerns regarding data privacy and may cause our customers or our customers customers to resist providing the data necessary to allow our customers to use our services effectively. Even the perception that the privacy of personal information is not satisfactorily protected or does not meet regulatory requirements could inhibit sales of our products or services and could limit adoption of our cloud-based solutions. Our efforts to expand our services beyond the CRM market and to develop and integrate our existing services in order to keep pace with technological developments may not succeed and may reduce our revenue growth rate and harm our business. We derive a significant portion of our revenue from subscriptions to our CRM enterprise cloud computing application services, and we expect this will continue for the foreseeable future. Our efforts to expand our services beyond the CRM market may not succeed and may reduce our revenue growth rate. The markets for certain of our offerings, including our Einstein artificial intelligence and data integration offerings, remain relatively new and it is uncertain whether our efforts, and related investments, will ever result in significant revenue for us. In addition, we may be required to continuously enhance our artificial intelligence offerings so that quality recommendations can be provided to our customers. Further, the introduction of significant platform changes and upgrades, including our Lightning platform and Customer 360 platform, may not succeed and early stage interest and adoption of such new services may not result in long term success or significant revenue for us. Additionally, if we fail to anticipate or identify significant Internet-related and other technology trends and developments early enough, or if we do not devote appropriate resources to adapting to such trends and developments, our business could be harmed. If we are unable to develop enhancements to and new features for our existing or new services that keep pace with rapid technological developments, our business could be harmed. The success of enhancements, new features and services depends on several factors, including the timely completion, introduction and market acceptance of the feature, service or enhancement by customers, administrators and developers, as well as our ability to seamlessly integrate all of our service offerings and develop adequate selling capabilities in new markets. Failure in this regard may significantly impair our revenue growth as well as negatively impact our operating results if the additional costs are not offset by additional revenues. In addition, because our services are designed to operate over various network technologies and on a variety of mobile devices, operating systems and computer hardware and software platforms using a standard browser, we will need to continuously modify and enhance our services to keep pace with changes in Internet-related hardware, software, communication, browser, app development platform and database technologies, as well as continue to maintain and support our services on legacy systems. We may not be successful in either developing these modifications and enhancements or in bringing them to market timely. Furthermore, uncertainties about the timing and nature of new network platforms or technologies, or modifications to existing platforms or technologies, could increase our research and development or service delivery expenses. Any failure of our services to operate effectively with future network platforms and technologies could reduce the demand for our services, result in customer dissatisfaction and harm our business. As we acquire and invest in companies or technologies, we may not realize the expected business or financial benefits and the acquisitions could prove difficult to integrate, disrupt our business, dilute stockholder value and adversely affect our operating results and the market value of our common stock. As part of our business strategy, we periodically make investments in, or acquisitions of, complementary businesses, joint ventures, services and technologies and intellectual property rights, and we expect that we will continue to make such investments and acquisitions in the future. In particular, in May 2018, we completed our largest acquisition to date of MuleSoft, for $6.4 billion, which we are continuing to integrate. Acquisitions and other transactions, arrangements, and investments involve numerous risks and could create unforeseen operating difficulties and expenditures, including: ##TABLE_START  potential failure to achieve the expected benefits on a timely basis or at all; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  difficulties in, and the cost of, integrating operations, technologies, services, platforms and personnel; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  diversion of financial and managerial resources from existing operations; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  the potential entry into new markets in which we have little or no experience or where competitors may have stronger market positions; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  potential write-offs of acquired assets or investments, and potential financial and credit risks associated with acquired customers; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  failure to assimilate acquired employees which may lead to retention risk of both key acquired employees or our existing key employees or disruption to existing teams; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  differences between our values and those of our acquired companies; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  difficulties in re-training key employees of acquired companies and integrating them into our organizational structure and corporate culture; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  difficulties in and financial costs of addressing acquired compensation structures inconsistent with our compensation structure; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  inability to generate sufficient revenue to offset acquisition or investment costs; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  inability to maintain relationships with customers and partners of the acquired business; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  changes to customer relationships or customer perception of the acquired business as a result of the acquisition; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  challenges converting and forecasting the acquired company's revenue recognition policies including subscription-based revenues and revenues based on the transfer of control as well as appropriate allocation of the customer consideration to the individual deliverables; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  difficulty of transitioning the acquired technology onto our existing platforms and customer acceptance of multiple platforms on a temporary or permanent basis; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  augmenting the acquired technologies and platforms to the levels that are consistent with our brand and reputation; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  potential for acquired products to impact the profitability of existing products; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  potential identified or unknown security vulnerabilities in acquired products that expose us to additional security risks or delay our ability to integrate the product into our service offerings or recognize the benefits of our investment; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  increasing or maintaining the security standards for acquired technology consistent with our other services; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  potential unknown liabilities associated with the acquired businesses; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  challenges relating to the structure of an investment, such as governance, accountability and decision-making conflicts that may arise in the context of a joint venture or other majority ownership investments; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  unanticipated expenses related to acquired technology and its integration into our existing technology; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  negative impact to our results of operations because of the depreciation and amortization of amounts related to acquired intangible assets, fixed assets and deferred compensation; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  additional stock-based compensation; the loss of acquired unearned revenue and unbilled unearned revenue; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  delays in customer purchases due to uncertainty related to any acquisition; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  ineffective or inadequate controls, procedures and policies at the acquired company may negatively impact our results of operations; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  in the case of foreign acquisitions, challenges caused by integrating operations over distance, and across different languages, cultures and political environments; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  currency and regulatory risks associated with foreign countries and potential additional cybersecurity and compliance risks resulting from entry into new markets; and ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  the tax effects and costs of any such acquisitions including the related integration into our tax structure and assessment of the impact on the realizability of our future tax assets or liabilities. ##TABLE_END Any of these risks could harm our business. In addition, to facilitate these acquisitions or investments, we may seek additional equity or debt financing, which may not be available on terms favorable to us or at all, which may affect our ability to complete subsequent acquisitions or investments, and which may affect the risks of owning our common stock. For example, if we finance acquisitions by issuing equity or convertible or other debt securities or loans, our existing stockholders may be diluted, or we could face constraints related to the terms of, and repayment obligation related to, the incurrence of indebtedness that could affect the market price of our common stock. Industry-specific regulation and other requirements and standards are evolving and unfavorable industry-specific laws, regulations, interpretive positions or standards could harm our business. Our customers and potential customers conduct business in a variety of industries, including financial services, the public sector, healthcare and telecommunications. Regulators in certain industries have adopted and may in the future adopt regulations or interpretive positions regarding the use of cloud computing and other outsourced services. The costs of compliance with, and other burdens imposed by, industry-specific laws, regulations and interpretive positions may limit our customers use and adoption of our services and reduce overall demand for our services. Compliance with these regulations may also require us to devote greater resources to support certain customers, which may increase costs and lengthen sales cycles. For example, some financial services regulators have imposed guidelines for use of cloud computing services that mandate specific controls or require financial services enterprises to obtain regulatory approval prior to outsourcing certain functions. If we are unable to comply with these guidelines or controls, or if our customers are unable to obtain regulatory approval to use our services where required, our business may be harmed. In addition, an inability to satisfy the standards of certain voluntary third-party certification bodies that our customers may expect, such as an attestation of compliance with the Payment Card Industry (PCI) Data Security Standards, may have an adverse impact on our business and results. If in the future we are unable to achieve or maintain industry-specific certifications or other requirements or standards relevant to our customers, it may harm our business and adversely affect our results. Further, in some cases, industry-specific laws, regionally-specific, or product-specific laws, regulations, or interpretive positions may also apply directly to us as a service provider. The interpretation of many of these statutes, regulations, and rulings is evolving in the courts and administrative agencies and an inability to comply may have an adverse impact on our business and results. Any failure or perceived failure by us to comply with such requirements could have an adverse impact on our business. For example, there are various statutes, regulations, and rulings relevant to the direct email marketing and text-messaging industries, including the Telephone Consumer Protection Act (TCPA) and related Federal Communication Commission (FCC) orders, which impose significant restrictions on the ability to utilize telephone calls and text messages to mobile telephone numbers as a means of communication, when the prior consent of the person being contacted has not been obtained. We have been, and may in the future be, subject to one or more class-action lawsuits, as well as individual lawsuits, containing allegations that one of our businesses or customers violated the TCPA. A determination that we or our customers violated the TCPA or other communications-based statutes could expose us to significant damage awards that could, individually or in the aggregate, materially harm our business. Supporting our existing and growing customer base could strain our personnel resources and infrastructure, and if we are unable to scale our operations and increase productivity, we may not be able to successfully implement our business plan. We continue to experience significant growth in our customer base and personnel, which has placed a strain on our management, administrative, operational and financial infrastructure. We anticipate that significant additional investments will be required to scale our operations and increase productivity, to address the needs of our customers, to further develop and enhance our services, to expand into new geographic areas, and to scale with our overall growth. The additional investments we are making will increase our cost base, which will make it more difficult for us to offset any future revenue shortfalls by reducing expenses in the short term. We regularly upgrade or replace our various software systems. If the implementations of these new applications are delayed, or if we encounter unforeseen problems with our new systems or in migrating away from our existing applications and systems, our operations and our ability to manage our business could be negatively impacted. Our success will depend in part upon the ability of our senior management to manage our projected growth effectively. To do so, we must continue to increase the productivity of our existing employees and to hire, train and manage new employees as needed. To manage the expected domestic and international growth of our operations and personnel, we will need to continue to improve our operational, financial and management controls, our reporting systems and procedures, and our utilization of real estate. If we fail to successfully scale our operations and increase productivity, we may be unable to execute our business plan and the fair value of our common stock could decline. The market in which we participate is intensely competitive, and if we do not compete effectively, our operating results could be harmed. The market for enterprise applications and platform services requires continuous innovation and is highly competitive, rapidly evolving and fragmented, and subject to changing technology and low barriers to entry, shifting customer needs and frequent introductions of new products and services. Many prospective customers have invested substantial personnel and financial resources to implement and integrate their current enterprise software into their businesses and therefore may be reluctant or unwilling to migrate away from their current solution to an enterprise cloud computing application service. Additionally, third-party developers may be reluctant to build application services on our platform since they have invested in other competing technology platforms. Our current competitors include: ##TABLE_START  Vendors of packaged business software, as well as companies offering enterprise apps delivered through on-premises offerings from enterprise software application vendors and cloud computing application service providers, either individually or with others; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Software companies that provide their product or service free of charge, and only charge a premium for advanced features and functionality; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Internally developed enterprise applications (by our potential customers IT departments); ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Marketing vendors, which may be specialized in advertising, targeting, messaging, or campaign automation; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  E-commerce solutions from established and emerging cloud-only vendors and established on-premises vendors; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Integration software vendors, integration service providers and API management providers; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Traditional platform development environment companies and cloud computing development platform companies who may develop toolsets and products that allow customers to build new apps that run on the customers current infrastructure or as hosted services; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  IoT platforms from large companies that have existing relationships with hardware and software companies; and ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Artificial intelligence solutions from new startups and established companies. ##TABLE_END Some of our current and potential competitors may have competitive advantages, such as greater name recognition, longer operating histories, significant installed bases, broader geographic scope, and larger marketing budgets, as well as substantially greater financial, technical, personnel, and other resources. In addition, many of our current and potential competitors have established marketing relationships and access to larger customer bases, and have major distribution agreements with consultants, system integrators and resellers. We also experience competition from smaller, younger competitors that may be more agile in responding to customers' demands. These competitors may be able to respond more quickly and effectively than we can to new or changing opportunities, technologies, standards or customer requirements or provide competitive pricing. As a result, even if our services are more effective than the products and services that our competitors offer, potential customers might select competitive products and services in lieu of purchasing our services. For all of these reasons, we may not be able to compete successfully against our current and future competitors, which could negatively impact our future sales and harm our business. Our ability to deliver our services is dependent on the development and maintenance of the infrastructure of the Internet by third parties. The Internets infrastructure is comprised of many different networks and services that are highly fragmented and distributed by design. This infrastructure is run by a series of independent third-party organizations that work together to provide the infrastructure and supporting services of the Internet under the governance of the Internet Corporation for Assigned Numbers and Names (ICANN) and the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA), now under the stewardship of ICANN. The Internet has experienced a variety of outages and other delays as a result of damages to portions of its infrastructure, denial-of-service attacks or related cyber incidents, and it could face outages and delays in the future. These outages and delays could reduce the level of Internet usage or result in fragmentation of the Internet, resulting in multiple separate Internets. These scenarios are not under our control and could reduce the availability of the Internet to us or our customers for delivery of our Internet-based services. Any resulting interruptions in our services or the ability of our customers to access our services could result in a loss of potential or existing customers and harm our business. In addition, certain countries have implemented (or may implement) legislative and technological actions that either do or can effectively regulate access to the Internet, including the ability of Internet Service Providers to limit access to specific websites or content. These actions could potentially limit or interrupt access to our services from certain countries or Internet Service Providers, impede our growth, result in the loss of potential or existing customers and harm our business. We are subject to risks associated with our strategic investments including partial or complete loss of invested capital. Significant changes in the fair value of this portfolio, including changes in the market prices of our investments in public companies and impairments, could negatively impact our financial results. We invest in early-to-late stage companies for strategic reasons and to support key business initiatives, and may not realize a return on our strategic investments. Many such companies generate net losses and the market for their products, services or technologies may be slow to develop, and, therefore, are dependent on the availability of later rounds of financing from banks or investors on favorable terms to continue their operations. The financial success of our investment in any company is typically dependent on a liquidity event, such as a public offering, acquisition or other favorable market event reflecting appreciation to the cost of our initial investment. The capital markets for public offerings and acquisitions are dynamic and the likelihood of liquidity events for the companies we have invested in could significantly worsen. Further, valuations of privately held companies are inherently complex due to the lack of readily available market data. Upon adoption of ASU 2016-01 in the first quarter of fiscal 2019, we are now required to record all fair value adjustments of our publicly traded and privately held equity investments through the consolidated statement of operations. As a result, we may experience additional volatility to our statements of operations due to changes in market prices of our investments in publicly held equity investments and the valuation and timing of observable price changes or impairments of our investments in privately held securities. This volatility has been and could continue to be material to our results in any given quarter based on market conditions and events and may cause our stock price to decline. While historically our investment portfolio has had a positive impact on our financial results, that may not be true for future periods, particularly in periods of significant market fluctuations which affect our strategic investments portfolio. All of our investments, especially our investments in privately held companies, are subject to a risk of a partial or total loss of investment capital. Our quarterly results are likely to fluctuate, which may cause the value of our common stock to decline substantially. Our quarterly results are likely to fluctuate. For example, our fiscal fourth quarter has historically been our strongest quarter for new business and renewals. The year-over-year compounding effect of this seasonality in billing patterns and overall new business and renewal activity causes the value of invoices that we generate in the fourth quarter to continually increase in proportion to our billings in the other three quarters of our fiscal year. As a result, our fiscal first quarter is our largest collections and operating cash flow quarter. Additionally, some of the important factors that may cause our revenues, operating results and cash flows to fluctuate from quarter to quarter include: ##TABLE_START  our ability to retain and increase sales to existing customers, attract new customers and satisfy our customers requirements; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  the attrition rates for our services; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  the rate of expansion and productivity of our sales force; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  the length of the sales cycle for our services; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  new product and service introductions by our competitors; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  our success in selling our services to large enterprises; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  our ability to realize benefits from strategic partnerships, acquisitions or investments; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  general economic or geopolitical conditions, which may adversely affect either our customers ability or willingness to purchase additional subscriptions or upgrade their services, or delay a prospective customer's purchasing decision, reduce the value of new subscription contracts, or affect attrition rates; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  variations in the revenue mix of our services and growth rates of our cloud subscription and support offerings, including the timing of software license sales and sales offerings that include an on-premise software element for which the revenue allocated to that deliverable is recognized upfront; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  the seasonality of our sales cycle, including software license sales, and timing of contract execution and the corresponding impact on revenue recognized at a point in time; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  changes in our pricing policies and terms of contracts, whether initiated by us or as a result of competition; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  changes in payment terms and the timing of customer payments and payment defaults by customers; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  changes in unearned revenue and the remaining performance obligation, due to seasonality, the timing of and compounding effects of renewals, invoice duration, size and timing, new business linearity between quarters and within a quarter, average contract term, the timing of license software revenue recognition, or fluctuations due to foreign currency movements, all of which may impact implied growth rates; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  the seasonality of our customers businesses, especially Commerce Cloud customers, including retailers and branded manufacturers; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  changes in foreign currency exchange rates such as with respect to the British Pound; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  the amount and timing of operating costs and capital expenditures related to the operations and expansion of our business; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  the number of new employees; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  the timing of commission, bonus, and other compensation payments to employees; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  the cost, timing and management effort for the introduction of new features to our services; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  the costs associated with acquiring new businesses and technologies and the follow-on costs of integration and consolidating the results of acquired businesses; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  expenses related to our real estate, our office leases and our data center capacity and expansion; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  timing of additional investments in our enterprise cloud computing application and platform services and in our consulting services; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  expenses related to significant, unusual or discrete events, which are recorded in the period in which the events occur; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  extraordinary expenses such as litigation or other dispute-related settlement payments; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  income tax effects, including the impact of changes in U.S. federal and state and international tax laws applicable to corporate multinationals; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  the timing of payroll and other withholding tax expenses, which are triggered by the payment of bonuses and when employees exercise their vested stock awards; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  technical difficulties or interruptions in our services; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  changes in interest rates and our mix of investments, which would impact the return on our investments in cash and marketable securities; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  conditions, particularly sudden changes, in the financial markets, which have impacted and may continue to impact the value of and liquidity of our investment portfolio; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  changes in the fair value of our strategic investments in early-to-late stage privately held and public companies, which could negatively and materially impact our financial results, particularly in periods of significant market fluctuations; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  equity issuances, including as consideration in acquisitions; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  the timing of stock awards to employees and the related adverse financial statement impact of having to expense those stock awards on a straight-line basis over their vesting schedules; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  evolving regulations of cloud computing and cross-border data transfer restrictions and similar regulations; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  regulatory compliance costs; and ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  the impact of new accounting pronouncements and associated system implementations, for example, the adoption of Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842) (ASU 2016-02), which includes the accounting for lease assets and lease liabilities. ##TABLE_END Many of these factors are outside of our control, and the occurrence of one or more of them might cause our operating results to vary widely. If we fail to meet or exceed operating results expectations or if securities analysts and investors have estimates and forecasts of our future performance that are unrealistic or that we do not meet, the market price of our common stock could decline. In addition, if one or more of the securities analysts who cover us adversely change their recommendation regarding our stock, the market price of our common stock could decline. If we experience significant fluctuations in our rate of anticipated growth and fail to balance our expenses with our revenue forecasts, our business could be harmed and the market price of our common stock could decline. Due to the pace of change and innovation in enterprise cloud computing services, the unpredictability of future general economic and financial market conditions, the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, the growing complexity of our business, including the use of multiple pricing and packaging models, and our increasing focus on enterprise cloud computing services, we may not be able to realize our projected revenue growth plans. We plan our expense levels and investment on estimates of future revenue and future anticipated rate of growth. We may not be able to adjust our spending appropriately if the addition of new subscriptions or the renewals of existing subscriptions fall short of our expectations. A portion of our expenses may also be fixed in nature for some minimum amount of time, such as with costs capitalized to obtain revenue contracts, data center contracts or office leases, so it may not be possible to reduce costs in a timely manner, or at all, without the payment of fees to exit certain obligations early. As a result, we expect that our revenues, operating results and cash flows may fluctuate significantly on a quarterly basis and revenue growth rates may not be sustainable and may decline in the future, and we may not be able to provide continued operating margin expansion, which could harm our business and cause the market price of our common stock to decline. Sales to customers outside the United States expose us to risks inherent in international operations. We sell our services throughout the world and are subject to risks and challenges associated with international business. We intend to continue to expand our international sales efforts. The risks and challenges associated with sales to customers outside the United States or those that can affect international operations generally, include: ##TABLE_START  localization of our services, including translation into foreign languages and associated expenses; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  regulatory frameworks or business practices favoring local competitors; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  pressure on the creditworthiness of sovereign nations, particularly in Europe, where we have customers and a balance of our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  evolving domestic and international tax environments; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  liquidity issues or political actions by sovereign nations, including nations with a controlled currency environment, which could result in decreased values of these balances or potential difficulties protecting our foreign assets or satisfying local obligations; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  foreign currency fluctuations and controls, which may make our services more expensive for international customers and could add volatility to our operating results; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  compliance with multiple, conflicting, ambiguous or evolving governmental laws and regulations, including employment, tax, privacy, anti-corruption, import/export, antitrust, data transfer, storage and protection, and industry-specific laws and regulations, including rules related to compliance by our third-party resellers and our ability to identify and respond timely to compliance issues when they occur; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  vetting and monitoring our third-party resellers in new and evolving markets to confirm they maintain standards consistent with our brand and reputation; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  uncertainty regarding regulation, currency, tax, and operations resulting from the Brexit vote that could disrupt trade, the sale of our services and commerce, and movement of our people between the United Kingdom, European Union, and locations; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  changes in the public perception of governments in the regions where we operate or plan to operate; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  regional data privacy laws and other regulatory requirements that apply to outsourced service providers and to the transmission of our customers data across international borders, which grow more complex as we scale and expand into new markets; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  treatment of revenue from international sources, intellectual property considerations and changes to tax codes, including being subject to foreign tax laws and being liable for paying withholding income or other taxes in foreign jurisdictions; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  different pricing environments; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  different or lesser protection of our intellectual property; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  longer accounts receivable payment cycles and other collection difficulties; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  natural disasters, acts of war, terrorism, pandemics or security breaches; and ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  regional economic and political conditions. ##TABLE_ENDAny of these factors could negatively impact our business and results of operations. The above factors may also negatively impact our ability to successfully expand into emerging market countries, where we have little or no operating experience, where it can be costly and challenging to establish and maintain operations, including hiring and managing required personnel, and difficult to promote our brand, and where we may not benefit from any first-to-market advantage or otherwise succeed. Because we generally recognize revenue from subscriptions for our services over the term of the subscription, downturns or upturns in new business may not be immediately reflected in our operating results. We generally recognize revenue from customers ratably over the terms of their subscription agreements, which are typically 12 to 36 months. As a result, most of the revenue we report in each quarter is the result of subscription agreements entered into during previous quarters. Consequently, a decline in new or renewed subscriptions in any one quarter may not be reflected in our revenue results for that quarter. Any such decline, however, will negatively impact our revenue in future quarters. Accordingly, the effect of significant downturns in sales and market acceptance of our services, and potential changes in our attrition rate, may not be fully reflected in our results of operations until future periods. Our subscription model also makes it difficult for us to rapidly increase our revenue through additional sales in any period, as revenue from new customers must be recognized over the applicable subscription term. If our customers do not renew their subscriptions for our services or reduce the number of paying subscriptions at the time of renewal, our revenue could decline and our business may suffer. If we cannot accurately predict subscription renewals or upgrade rates, we may not meet our revenue targets, which may adversely affect the market price of our common stock. Our customers have no obligation to renew their subscriptions for our services after the expiration of their contractual subscription period, which is typically 12 to 36 months, and in the normal course of business, some customers have elected not to renew. In addition, our customers may renew for fewer subscriptions, renew for shorter contract lengths, or switch to lower cost offerings of our services. It is difficult to predict attrition rates given our varied customer base of enterprise and small and medium size business customers and the number of multi-year subscription contracts. Our attrition rates may increase or fluctuate as a result of a number of factors, including customer dissatisfaction with our services, customers spending levels, mix of customer base, decreases in the number of users at our customers, competition, pricing increases or changes and deteriorating general economic conditions. Our future success also depends in part on our ability to sell additional features and services, more subscriptions or enhanced editions of our services to our current customers. This may also require increasingly sophisticated and costly sales efforts that are targeted at senior management. Similarly, the rate at which our customers purchase new or enhanced services depends on a number of factors, including general economic conditions and that our customers do not react negatively to any price changes related to these additional features and services. If customers do not renew their subscriptions, do not purchase additional features or enhanced subscriptions or if attrition rates increase, our business could be harmed. If third-party developers and providers do not continue to embrace our technology delivery model and enterprise cloud computing services, or if our customers seek warranties from us for third-party applications, integrations, data and content, our business could be harmed. Our success depends on the willingness of a growing community of third-party developers and technology providers to build applications and provide integrations, data and content that are complementary to our services. Without the continued development of these applications and provision of such integrations, data and content, both current and potential customers may not find our services sufficiently attractive, which could impact future sales. In addition, for those customers who authorize a third-party technology partner access to their data, we do not provide any warranty related to the functionality, security and integrity of the data transmission or processing. Despite contract provisions to protect us, customers may look to us to support and provide warranties for the third-party applications, integrations, data and content, even though not developed or sold by us, which may expose us to potential claims, liabilities and obligations, all of which could harm our business. We are exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates that could negatively impact our financial results and cash flows from changes in the value of the U.S. Dollar versus local currencies and the Euro versus the Pound Sterling. We conduct our business in the following regions: the Americas, Europe and Asia Pacific. The expanding global scope of our business exposes us to risk of fluctuations in foreign currency markets. This exposure is the result of selling in multiple currencies, growth in our international investments, including data center expansion, additional headcount in foreign locations, and operating in countries where the functional currency is the local currency. Specifically, our results of operations and cash flows are subject to fluctuations primarily in British Pound Sterling, Euro, Japanese Yen, Canadian Dollar and Australian Dollar against the U.S. Dollar as well as the Euro against the Pound Sterling. These exposures may change over time as business practices evolve, economic and political conditions change and evolving tax regulations come into effect. The fluctuations of currencies in which we conduct business can both increase and decrease our overall revenue and expenses for any given fiscal period. Additionally, global political events, including the United Kingdoms 2016 vote in favor of exiting the European Union, or Brexit, and similar geopolitical developments, fluctuating commodity prices and trade tariff developments, have caused global economic uncertainty and uncertainty about the interest rate environment, which could amplify the volatility of currency fluctuations. Such volatility, even when it increases our revenues or decreases our expenses, impacts our ability to predict our future results and earnings accurately. Although we attempt to mitigate some of this volatility and related risks through foreign currency hedging, our hedging activities are limited in scope and may not effectively offset the adverse financial impacts that may result from unfavorable movements in foreign currency exchange rates, which could adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations. As more of our sales efforts are targeted at larger enterprise customers, our sales cycle may become more time-consuming and expensive, we may encounter pricing pressure and implementation and configuration challenges, and we may have to delay revenue recognition for some complex transactions, all of which could harm our business and operating results. As we target more of our sales efforts at larger enterprise customers, including governmental entities, we may face greater costs, longer sales cycles, greater competition and less predictability in completing some of our sales. In this market segment, the customers decision to use our services may be an enterprise-wide decision and, if so, these types of sales would require us to provide greater levels of education regarding the use and benefits of our services, as well as education regarding privacy and data protection laws and regulations to prospective customers with international operations. In addition, larger customers and governmental entities may demand more configuration, integration services and features. As a result of these factors, these sales opportunities may require us to devote greater sales support and professional services resources to individual customers, driving up costs and time required to complete sales and diverting our own sales and professional services resources to a smaller number of larger transactions, while potentially requiring us to delay revenue recognition on some of these transactions until the technical or implementation requirements have been met. Pricing and packaging strategies for enterprise and other customers for subscriptions to our existing and future service offerings may not be widely accepted by other new or existing customers. Our adoption of such new pricing and packaging strategies may harm our business. For large enterprise customers, professional services may also be performed by a third party or a combination of our own staff and a third-party. Our strategy is to work with third parties to increase the breadth of capability and depth of capacity for delivery of these services to our customers. If a customer is not satisfied with the quality of work performed by us or a third-party or with the type of services or solutions delivered, then we could incur additional costs to address the situation, the profitability of that work might be impaired, and the customers dissatisfaction with our services could damage our ability to obtain additional work from that customer. In addition, negative publicity related to our customer relationships, regardless of its accuracy, may further damage our business by affecting our ability to compete for new business with current and prospective customers. We have been and may in the future be sued by third parties for various claims including alleged infringement of proprietary rights. We are involved in various legal matters arising from the normal course of business activities. These may include claims, suits, government investigations and other proceedings involving alleged infringement of third-party patents and other intellectual property rights, commercial, corporate and securities, labor and employment, class actions, wage and hour, and other matters. The software and Internet industries are characterized by the existence of a large number of patents, trademarks and copyrights and by frequent litigation based on allegations of infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights. We have received in the past and may receive in the future communications from third parties, including practicing entities and non-practicing entities, claiming that we have infringed their intellectual property rights. In addition, we have been, and may in the future be, sued by third parties for alleged infringement of their claimed proprietary rights. Our technologies may be subject to injunction if they are found to infringe the rights of a third-party or we may be required to pay damages, or both. Further, many of our subscription agreements require us to indemnify our customers for third-party intellectual property infringement claims, which would increase the cost to us of an adverse ruling on such a claim. Our exposure to risks associated with various claims, including the use of intellectual property, may be increased as a result of acquisitions of other companies. For example, we may have a lower level of visibility into the development process with respect to intellectual property or the care taken to safeguard against infringement risks with respect to the acquired company or technology. In addition, third parties may make infringement and similar or related claims after we have acquired technology that had not been asserted prior to our acquisition. The outcome of any claims or litigation, regardless of the merits, is inherently uncertain. Any claims and lawsuits, and the disposition of such claims and lawsuits, whether through settlement or licensing discussions, or litigation, could be time-consuming and expensive to resolve, divert management attention from executing our business plan, result in efforts to enjoin our activities, lead to attempts on the part of other parties to pursue similar claims and, in the case of intellectual property claims, require us to change our technology, change our business practices, pay monetary damages or enter into short- or long-term royalty or licensing agreements. Any adverse determination related to intellectual property claims or other litigation could prevent us from offering our services to others, could be material to our financial condition or cash flows, or both, or could otherwise adversely affect our operating results. In addition, depending on the nature and timing of any such dispute, an unfavorable resolution of a legal matter could materially affect our current or future results of operations or cash flows in a particular quarter. Any failure to protect our intellectual property rights could impair our ability to protect our proprietary technology and our brand, cause us to incur significant expenses and harm our business. If we fail to protect our intellectual property rights adequately, our competitors may gain access to our technology, affecting our brand, causing us to incur significant expenses and harming our business. Any of our patents, trademarks or other intellectual property rights may be challenged by others or invalidated through administrative process or litigation. While we have many U.S. patents and pending U.S. and international patent applications, we may be unable to obtain patent protection for the technology covered in our patent applications or the patent protection may not be obtained quickly enough to meet our business needs. In addition, our existing patents and any patents issued in the future may not provide us with competitive advantages, or may be successfully challenged by third parties. Furthermore, legal standards relating to the validity, enforceability and scope of protection of intellectual property rights are uncertain, and we also may face proposals to change the scope of protection for some intellectual property rights in the U.S. Effective patent, trademark, copyright and trade secret protection may not be available to us in every country in which our services are available. The laws of some foreign countries may not be as protective of intellectual property rights as those in the U.S., and mechanisms for enforcement of intellectual property rights may be inadequate. Also, our involvement in standard setting activity or the need to obtain licenses from others may require us to license our intellectual property. Accordingly, despite our efforts, we may be unable to prevent third parties from using our intellectual property. We may be required to spend significant resources and expense to monitor and protect our intellectual property rights. We may initiate claims or litigation against third parties for infringement of our proprietary rights or to establish the validity of our proprietary rights. If we fail to protect our intellectual property rights, it could impact our ability to protect our technology and brand. Furthermore, any litigation, whether or not it is resolved in our favor, could result in significant expense to us, cause us to divert time and resources and harm our business. Our continued success depends on our ability to maintain and enhance our brands. We believe that the brand identities we have developed have significantly contributed to the success of our business. Maintaining and enhancing the Salesforce brand and our other brands are critical to expanding our base of customers, partners and employees. Our brand strength will depend largely on our ability to remain a technology leader and continue to provide high-quality innovative products, services, and features securely, reliably and in a manner that enhances our customers' success. In order to maintain and enhance our brands, we may be required to make substantial investments that may later prove to be unsuccessful. In addition, our services, including AI predictions, may be used by our customers for purposes inconsistent with our company values, which may harm our brand. As with many innovations, AI presents risks and challenges that could affect its adoption and therefore our business. Further, the development of AI presents emerging ethical issues. If we enable or offer AI solutions that are controversial, due to their impact, or perceived impact, on human rights, privacy, employment, or in other social contexts, we may experience brand or reputational harm, competitive harm or legal liability. In addition, positions we take on social issues may be unpopular with some customers or potential customers, which may impact our ability to attract or retain such customers. Our brand is also associated with our public commitments to sustainability and equality, and any perceived changes in our dedication to these commitments could adversely impact our relationships with our customers. In addition, we have secured the naming rights to facilities controlled by third parties, such as office towers and a transit center, and any negative events or publicity arising in connection with these facilities could adversely impact our brand. If we fail to maintain and enhance our brands, or if we incur excessive expenses in our efforts to do so, our business, operating results and financial condition may be materially and adversely affected. We may lose key members of our management team or development and operations personnel, and may be unable to attract and retain employees we need to support our operations and growth. Our success depends substantially upon the continued services of our executive officers and other key members of management, particularly our co-chief executive officers. From time to time, there may be changes in our executive management team resulting from the hiring or departure of executives. Such changes in our executive management team may be disruptive to our business. We are also substantially dependent on the continued service of our existing development and operations personnel because of the complexity of our services and technologies. We do not have employment agreements with any of our executive officers, key management, development or operations personnel and they could terminate their employment with us at any time. The loss of one or more of our key employees or groups could seriously harm our business. The technology industry is subject to substantial and continuous competition for engineers with high levels of experience in designing, developing and managing software and Internet-related services, as well as competition for sales executives, data scientists and operations personnel. We may not be successful in attracting and retaining qualified personnel. We have from time to time experienced, and we expect to continue to experience, difficulty in hiring, developing, integrating and retaining highly skilled employees with appropriate qualifications. These difficulties may be amplified by evolving restrictions on immigration, travel, or availability of visas for skilled technology workers. These difficulties may potentially be further amplified by the high cost of living in the San Francisco Bay Area, where our headquarters are located. If we fail to attract new personnel or fail to retain and motivate our current personnel, our business and future growth prospects could be severely harmed. In addition, we believe in the importance of our corporate culture of Ohana, which fosters dialogue, collaboration, recognition and a sense of family. As our organization grows and expands globally, and as employees workplace expectations develop, we may find it increasingly difficult to maintain the beneficial aspects of our corporate culture. This could negatively impact our ability to attract and retain employees or our reputation with customers and could negatively impact our future growth. Any failure in our delivery of high-quality technical support services may adversely affect our relationships with our customers and our financial results. Our customers depend on our support organization to resolve technical issues relating to our applications. We may be unable to respond quickly enough to accommodate short-term increases in customer demand for support services. Increased customer demand for these services, without corresponding revenues, could increase costs and adversely affect our operating results. In addition, our sales process is highly dependent on our applications and business reputation and on positive recommendations from our existing customers. Any failure to maintain high-quality technical support, or a market perception that we do not maintain high-quality support, could adversely affect our reputation, our ability to sell our service offerings to existing and prospective customers, and our business, operating results and financial position. Periodic changes to our sales organization can be disruptive and may reduce our rate of growth. We periodically change and make adjustments to our sales organization in response to market opportunities, competitive threats, management changes, product introductions or enhancements, acquisitions, sales performance, increases in sales headcount, cost levels and other internal and external considerations. Any such future sales organization changes may result in a temporary reduction of productivity, which could negatively impact our rate of growth. In addition, any significant change to the way we structure our compensation of our sales organization may be disruptive and may affect our revenue growth. Unanticipated changes in our effective tax rate and additional tax liabilities may impact our financial results. We are subject to income taxes in the United States and various jurisdictions outside of the United States. Our income tax obligations are generally determined based on our business operations in these jurisdictions. Significant judgment is often required in the determination of our worldwide provision for income taxes. Our effective tax rate could be impacted by changes in the earnings and losses in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in non-deductible expenses, changes in excess tax benefits of stock-based compensation, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities and our ability to utilize them, the applicability of withholding taxes, effects from acquisitions, changes in accounting principles and tax laws in jurisdictions where we operate. Any changes, ambiguity, or uncertainty in taxing jurisdictions' administrative interpretations, decisions, policies and positions could also materially impact our income tax liabilities. As our business continues to grow and if we become more profitable, we anticipate that our income tax obligations could significantly increase. If our existing tax credits and net operating loss carry-forwards become fully utilized, we may be unable to offset or otherwise mitigate our tax obligations to the same extent as in prior years. This could have a material impact to our future cash flows or operating results. In addition, recent global tax developments applicable to multinational businesses, including certain approaches of addressing taxation of digital economy recently proposed or enacted by the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development, the European Commission or certain major jurisdictions where we operate might have a material impact to our business and future cash flow from operating activities, or future financial results. We are also subject to tax examinations in multiple jurisdictions. While we regularly evaluate new information that may change our judgment resulting in recognition, derecognition or changes in measurement of a tax position taken, there can be no assurance that the final determination of any examinations will not have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial position. In addition, our operations may change, which may impact our tax liabilities. As our brand becomes increasingly recognizable both domestically and internationally, our tax planning structure and corresponding profile may be subject to increased scrutiny and if we are perceived negatively, we may experience brand or reputational harm. We may also be subject to additional tax liabilities and penalties due to changes in non-income based taxes resulting from changes in federal, state or international tax laws, changes in taxing jurisdictions administrative interpretations, decisions, policies, and positions, results of tax examinations, settlements or judicial decisions, changes in accounting principles, changes to the business operations, including acquisitions, as well as the evaluation of new information that results in a change to a tax position taken in a prior period. Any resulting increase in our tax obligation or cash taxes paid could adversely affect our cash flows and financial results. Our debt service obligations and operating lease commitments may adversely affect our financial condition and cash flows from operations. We have a substantial level of debt, including the 2023 and 2028 Senior Notes we issued in April 2018 (\"Senior Notes) due April 2023 and April 2028, the loan we assumed when we purchased an office building located at 50 Fremont Street in San Francisco, California (50 Fremont) due June 2023, the $500.0 million term loan to finance our acquisition of MuleSoft, due May 2021 (\"2021 term loan\") and capital lease arrangements. Additionally, we have significant contractual commitments, including operating lease arrangements, which are not reflected on our consolidated balance sheets, as well as a financing obligation for a leased facility of which we are deemed the owner for accounting purposes. In April 2018, we amended and restated our revolving credit facility under which we can draw down up to $1.0 billion. Maintenance of our indebtedness and contractual commitments and any additional issuances of indebtedness could: ##TABLE_START  impair our ability to obtain additional financing in the future for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, general corporate or other purposes; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  cause us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flows from operations towards debt service obligations and principal repayments; and ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  make us more vulnerable to downturns in our business, our industry or the economy in general. ##TABLE_END Our ability to meet our expenses and debt obligations will depend on our future performance, which will be affected by financial, business, economic, regulatory and other factors. We will not be able to control many of these factors, such as economic conditions and governmental regulations. Further, our operations may not generate sufficient cash to enable us to service our debt or contractual obligations resulting from our leases. If we fail to make a payment on our debt, we could be in default on such debt. If we are at any time unable to generate sufficient cash flows from operations to service our indebtedness when payment is due, we may be required to attempt to renegotiate the terms of the instruments relating to the indebtedness, seek to refinance all or a portion of the indebtedness or obtain additional financing. There can be no assurance that we would be able to successfully renegotiate such terms, that any such refinancing would be possible or that any additional financing could be obtained on terms that are favorable or acceptable to us. Any new or refinanced debt may be subject to substantially higher interest rates, which could adversely affect our financial condition and impact our business. In addition, changes by any rating agency to our credit rating may negatively impact the value and liquidity of both our debt and equity securities, as well as the potential costs associated with a refinancing of our debt. Under certain circumstances, if our credit ratings are downgraded or other negative action is taken, the interest rate payable by us under our revolving credit facility could increase. Downgrades in our credit ratings could also affect the terms of any such refinancing or future financing or restrict our ability to obtain additional financing in the future. Our senior unsecured notes and senior unsecured credit agreements impose restrictions on us and require us to maintain compliance with specified covenants. Our ability to comply with these covenants may be affected by events beyond our control. A failure to comply with the covenants and other provisions of our outstanding debt could result in events of default under such instruments, which could permit acceleration of all of our debt and borrowings. Any required repayment of our debt or revolving credit facility as a result of a fundamental change or other acceleration would lower our current cash on hand such that we would not have those funds available for use in our business. New lease accounting guidance requires that we record operating lease activity on our consolidated balance sheet in fiscal 2020, which will result in an increase in both our assets and financing obligations. The implementation of this guidance may impact our ability to obtain the necessary financing from financial institutions at commercially viable rates or at all as this new guidance will result in a higher financing obligation on our consolidated balance sheet. Weakened global economic conditions may adversely affect our industry, business and results of operations. Our overall performance depends in part on worldwide economic and geopolitical conditions. The United States and other key international economies have experienced cyclical downturns from time to time in which economic activity was impacted by falling demand for a variety of goods and services, restricted credit, poor liquidity, reduced corporate profitability, volatility in credit, equity and foreign exchange markets, bankruptcies and overall uncertainty with respect to the economy. These economic conditions can arise suddenly and the full impact of such conditions can remain uncertain. In addition, geopolitical developments, such as potential trade wars, can increase levels of political and economic unpredictability globally and increase the volatility of global financial markets. Moreover, these conditions can affect the rate of information technology spending and could adversely affect our customers ability or willingness to purchase our enterprise cloud computing services, delay prospective customers purchasing decisions, reduce the value or duration of their subscription contracts, or affect attrition rates, all of which could adversely affect our future sales and operating results. Natural disasters and other events beyond our control could materially adversely affect us. Natural disasters or other catastrophic events may cause damage or disruption to our operations, international commerce and the global economy, and thus could have a strong negative effect on us. Our business operations are subject to interruption by natural disasters, fire, power shortages, pandemics and other events beyond our control. Although we maintain crisis management and disaster response plans, such events could make it difficult or impossible for us to deliver our services to our customers, and could decrease demand for our services. Our corporate headquarters, and a significant portion of our research and development activities, information technology systems, and other critical business operations, are located near major seismic faults in the San Francisco Bay Area. Because we do not carry earthquake insurance for direct quake-related losses, with the exception of the building that we own in San Francisco, and significant recovery time could be required to resume operations, our financial condition and operating results could be materially adversely affected in the event of a major earthquake or catastrophic event. Climate change may have a long-term impact on our business. While we seek to mitigate our business risks associated with climate change by establishing robust environmental programs and partnering with organizations who are also focused on mitigating their own climate related risks, we recognize that there are inherent climate related risks wherever business is conducted. Access to clean water and reliable energy in the communities where we conduct our business, whether for our offices, data centers, vendors, customers or other stakeholders, is a priority. Any of our primary locations may be vulnerable to the adverse effects of climate change. For example, our California headquarters are projected to be vulnerable to future water scarcity due to climate change. Climate related events, including the increasing frequency of extreme weather events and their impact on U.S. critical infrastructure, have the potential to disrupt our business, our third party suppliers, or the business of our customers, and may cause us to experience higher attrition, losses and additional costs to maintain or resume operations. Current and future accounting pronouncements and other financial reporting standards, especially but not only concerning revenue recognition, cost capitalization and lease accounting, may negatively impact our financial results. We regularly monitor our compliance with applicable financial reporting standards and review new pronouncements and drafts thereof that are relevant to us. As a result of new standards, changes to existing standards and changes in their interpretation, we have been required to change our accounting policies, particularly concerning revenue recognition and the capitalized incremental costs to obtain a customer contract, to alter our operational policies, to implement new or enhance existing systems so that they reflect new or amended financial reporting standards, and to adjust our published financial statements. We will have similar requirements related to future accounting pronouncements, such as lease accounting. Such changes may have an adverse effect on our business, financial position, and operating results, or cause an adverse deviation from our revenue and operating profit target, which may negatively impact our financial results. We may be subject to risks related to government contracts and related procurement regulations. Our contracts with federal, state, local, and foreign government entities are subject to various procurement regulations and other requirements relating to their formation, administration and performance. We may be subject to audits and investigations relating to our government contracts, and any violations could result in various civil and criminal penalties and administrative sanctions, including termination of contract, refunding or suspending of payments, forfeiture of profits, payment of fines, and suspension or debarment from future government business. In addition, such contracts may provide for termination by the government at any time, without cause. Any of these risks related to contracting with governmental entities could adversely impact our future sales and operating results. We are subject to governmental export and import controls that could impair our ability to compete in international markets and subject us to liability if we are not in full compliance with applicable laws. Our solutions are subject to export and import controls, including the Commerce Departments Export Administration Regulations, U.S. Customs regulations and various economic and trade sanctions regulations established by the Treasury Departments Office of Foreign Assets Control. If we fail to comply with these U.S. export control laws and import laws we and certain of our employees could be subject to substantial civil or criminal penalties, including the possible loss of export or import privileges; fines, which may be imposed on us and responsible employees or managers; and, in extreme cases, the incarceration of responsible employees or managers. Obtaining the necessary authorizations, including any required license, may be time-consuming, is not guaranteed and may result in the delay or loss of sales opportunities. Furthermore, the U.S. export control laws and economic sanctions laws prohibit the shipment of certain products and services to U.S. embargoed or sanctioned countries, governments and persons. Even though we take precautions to prevent our solutions from being provisioned or provided to U.S. sanctions targets in violation of applicable regulations, our solutions could be provisioned to those targets or provided by our resellers despite such precautions. Any such sales could have negative consequences, including government investigations, penalties and reputational harm. Changes in our solutions or changes in export and import regulations may create delays in the introduction, sale and deployment of our solutions in international markets or prevent the export or import of our solutions to certain countries, governments or persons altogether. Any decreased use of our solutions or limitation on our ability to export or sell our solutions would likely adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Risks Related to Our Common Stock The market price of our common stock is likely to be volatile and could subject us to litigation. The trading prices of the securities of technology companies have historically been highly volatile. Accordingly, the market price of our common stock has been and is likely to continue to be subject to wide fluctuations. Factors affecting the market price of our common stock include: ##TABLE_START  variations in our operating results, earnings per share, cash flows from operating activities, unearned revenue, remaining performance obligation, year-over-year growth rates for individual core service offerings and other financial metrics and non-financial metrics, such as transaction usage volumes and other usage metrics, and how those results compare to analyst expectations; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  variations in, and limitations of, the various financial and other metrics and modeling used by analysts in their research and reports about our business; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  forward-looking guidance to industry and financial analysts related to, for example, future revenue, unearned revenue, remaining performance obligation, cash flows from operating activities and earnings per share; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  changes in the estimates of our operating results or changes in recommendations by securities analysts that elect to follow our common stock; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  announcements of technological innovations, new services or service enhancements, strategic alliances or significant agreements by us or by our competitors; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  announcements by us or by our competitors of mergers or other strategic acquisitions, or rumors of such transactions involving us or our competitors; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  announcements of customer additions and customer cancellations or delays in customer purchases; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  the coverage of our common stock by the financial media, including television, radio and press reports and blogs; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  recruitment or departure of key personnel; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  disruptions in our service due to computer hardware, software, network or data center problems; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  the economy as a whole, geopolitical conditions, market conditions in our industry and the industries of our customers; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  trading activity by a limited number of stockholders who together beneficially own a significant portion of our outstanding common stock; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  the issuance of shares of common stock by us, whether in connection with an acquisition or a capital raising transaction; and ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  issuance of debt or other convertible securities. ##TABLE_END In addition, if the market for technology stocks or the stock market in general experiences uneven investor confidence, the market price of our common stock could decline for reasons unrelated to our business, operating results or financial condition. The market price of our common stock might also decline in reaction to events that affect other companies within, or outside, our industry even if these events do not directly affect us. Some companies that have experienced volatility in the trading price of their stock have been the subject of securities class action litigation. If we are the subject of such litigation, it could result in substantial costs and a diversion of managements attention and resources. Provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws and Delaware law might discourage, delay or prevent a change of control of our company or changes in our management and, therefore, depress the market price of our common stock. Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that could depress the market price of our common stock by acting to discourage, delay or prevent a change in control of our company or changes in our management that the stockholders of our company may deem advantageous. These provisions among other things: ##TABLE_START  permit the board of directors to establish the number of directors; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  provide that directors may only be removed with the approval of holders of 66 2/3 percent of our outstanding capital stock; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  require super-majority voting to amend some provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  authorize the issuance of blank check preferred stock that our board could use to implement a stockholder rights plan (also known as a poison pill); ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  prohibit stockholder action by written consent, which requires all stockholder actions to be taken at a meeting of our stockholders; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  provide that the board of directors is expressly authorized to make, alter or repeal our bylaws; and ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  establish advance notice requirements for nominations for election to our board or for proposing matters that can be acted upon by stockholders at annual stockholder meetings. ##TABLE_END In addition, Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law may discourage, delay or prevent a change in control of our company. Section 203 imposes certain restrictions on merger, business combinations and other transactions between us and holders of 15 percent or more of our common stock. ", "1B": " ITEM 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS None. ", "2": " ITEM 2. PROPERTIES As of January 31, 2019 , our executive and principal offices for sales, marketing, professional and administrative services and development consist of approximately 2.1 million square feet of leased and owned property in San Francisco. Of this total, we lease and occupy approximately 1.2 million square feet and own and occupy a majority of the approximately 820,000 square feet of total owned space at 50 Fremont Street. Of the total leased and owned space in San Francisco, 1.9 million square feet is concentrated in our urban campus, which includes 50 Fremont Street, 350 Mission Street, and Salesforce Tower located at 415 Mission Street (\"Salesforce Tower\"), collectively defined as our \"Urban Campus\". Each of the three buildings occupy one of the four corners of a major intersection in downtown San Francisco. In addition, we lease approximately 644,000 square feet in San Francisco which is either currently sublet or scheduled for disposition in fiscal 2020. This space is not included in the amounts above. In November 2018, we entered into a lease agreement for approximately 324,000 rentable square feet of office space in a building to be constructed as part of our urban campus in San Francisco, California. As of January 31, 2019, construction has not commenced on the building and is dependent on the developer obtaining approvals from the City and County of San Francisco. We expect to begin occupying the space in fiscal 2024. We also lease space in various locations throughout the United States for local sales and professional services personnel. Our foreign subsidiaries lease office space in a number of countries in Europe, North America, Asia, South America, Africa and Australia for our international operations, primarily for local sales and professional services personnel. We also operate data centers in the U.S., Europe and Asia pursuant to various co-location lease arrangements. We believe that our existing facilities and offices are adequate to meet our current requirements. If we require additional space, we believe that we will be able to obtain such space on acceptable, commercially reasonable terms. ##TABLE_START ", "3": " ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS ##TABLE_END In the ordinary course of business, we are or may be involved in various legal or regulatory proceedings, claims, or purported class actions related to alleged infringement of third-party patents and other intellectual property rights, or alleged violation of commercial, corporate and securities, labor and employment, wage and hour, or other laws or regulations. We have been, and may in the future be put on notice and/or sued by third parties for alleged infringement of their proprietary rights, including patent infringement. In December 2018, we were named as a nominal defendant and certain of our current and former directors were named as defendants in a purported shareholder derivative action in the Delaware Court of Chancery. The complaint alleged that excessive compensation was paid to such directors for their service, included claims of breach of fiduciary duty and unjust enrichment, and sought restitution and disgorgement of a portion of the directors' compensation. Subsequently, three similar shareholder derivative actions were filed in the Delaware Court of Chancery. The cases have been consolidated under the caption In re Salesforce.com, Inc. Derivative Litigation . We believe that the ultimate outcome of this litigation will not materially and adversely affect the Company's business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. We evaluate all claims and lawsuits with respect to their potential merits, our potential defenses and counterclaims, settlement or litigation potential and the expected effect on us. Our technologies may be subject to injunction if they are found to infringe the rights of a third-party. In addition, many of our subscription agreements require us to indemnify our customers for third-party intellectual property infringement claims, which could increase the cost to us of an adverse ruling on such a claim. The outcome of any claims or litigation, regardless of the merits, is inherently uncertain. Any claims and other lawsuits, and the disposition of such claims and lawsuits, whether through settlement or litigation, could be time-consuming and expensive to resolve, divert our attention from executing our business plan, result in efforts to enjoin our activities, lead to attempts by third parties to seek similar claims and, in the case of intellectual property claims, require us to change our technology, change our business practices, pay monetary damages or enter into short- or long-term royalty or licensing agreements. In general, the resolution of a legal matter could prevent us from offering our service to others, could be material to our financial condition or cash flows, or both, or could otherwise adversely affect our operating results. We make a provision for a liability relating to legal matters when it is both probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. These provisions are reviewed at least quarterly and adjusted to reflect the impacts of negotiations, estimated settlements, legal rulings, advice of legal counsel and other information and events pertaining to a particular matter. The outcomes of our legal proceedings and other contingencies are, however, inherently unpredictable and subject to significant uncertainties. As a result, we may not be able to reasonably estimate the amount or range of possible losses in excess of any amounts accrued, including losses that could arise as a result of application of non-monetary remedies, with respect to any contingencies, and our estimates may not prove to be accurate. In our opinion, resolution of all current matters is not expected to have a material adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations, cash flows or financial position. However, depending on the nature and timing of a given dispute or other contingency, an unfavorable resolution could materially affect our current or future results of operations or cash flows, or both, in a particular quarter.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS ##TABLE_ENDThe following discussion contains forward-looking statements, including, without limitation, our expectations and statements regarding our outlook and future revenues, expenses, results of operations, liquidity, plans, strategies and management objectives and any assumptions underlying any of the foregoing. Our actual results may differ significantly from those projected in the forward-looking statements. Our forward-looking statements and factors that might cause future actual results to differ materially from our recent results or those projected in the forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, those discussed in the section titled Forward-Looking Information and Risk Factors of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Except as required by law, we assume no obligation to update the forward-looking statements or our risk factors for any reason. Overview We are a global leader in customer relationship management (\"CRM\") technology that enables companies to improve their relationships and interactions with customers. We introduced our first CRM solution in 2000, and we have since expanded our service offerings with new editions, features and platform capabilities. Our core mission is to empower our customers of every size and industry to connect with their customers in new ways through existing and emerging technologies including cloud, mobile, social, Internet of Things (\"IoT\") and artificial intelligence (\"AI\") technologies. Our Customer Success Platform - including sales force automation, customer service and support, marketing automation, digital commerce, community management, industry-specific solutions, analytics, integration solutions, application development, IoT integration, collaborative productivity tools, our AppExchange, which is our enterprise cloud marketplace, and our professional cloud services - provides the tools customers need to succeed in a digital world. Key elements of our strategy include: ##TABLE_START  cross sell and upsell; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  extend existing service offerings; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  reduce customer attrition; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  expand and strengthen the partner ecosystem; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  expand internationally; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  target vertical industries; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  expand into new horizontal markets; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  extend go-to-market capabilities; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  ensure strong customer adoption; and ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  encourage the development of third-party applications on our cloud computing platform. ##TABLE_END We are also committed to a sustainable, low-carbon future, advancing equality and diversity, and fostering employee success. We try to integrate social good into everything we do. All of these goals align with our long-term growth strategy and financial and operational priorities. We believe the factors that will influence our ability to achieve our objectives include: our prospective customers willingness to migrate to enterprise cloud computing services; our ability to maintain a balanced portfolio of products and customers; the availability, performance and security of our service; our ability to continue to release, and gain customer acceptance of, new and improved features; our ability to successfully integrate acquired businesses and technologies; successful customer adoption and utilization of our service; our ability to continue to meet new and evolving privacy laws and regulations, acceptance of our service in markets where we have few customers; the emergence of additional competitors in our market and improved product offerings by existing and new competitors; the location of new data centers that we operate as well as the new locations of services provided by third-party cloud computing platform providers; third-party developers willingness to develop applications on our platforms; our ability to attract new personnel and retain and motivate current personnel; and general economic conditions which could affect our customers ability and willingness to purchase our services, delay the customers purchasing decision or affect attrition rates. To address these factors, we will need to, among other things, continue to add substantial numbers of paying subscriptions, upgrade our customers to fully featured versions or arrangements such as an Enterprise License Agreement, provide high quality technical support to our customers, encourage the development of third-party applications on our platforms, realize the benefits from our strategic partnerships and continue to focus on retaining customers at the time of renewal. Our plans to invest for future growth include the continuation of the expansion of our data center capacity, whether internally or through the use of third parties, the hiring of additional personnel, particularly in direct sales, other customer-related areas and research and development, the expansion of domestic and international selling and marketing activities, specifically in our top markets, the continued development of our brands, the addition of distribution channels, the upgrade of our service offerings, the continued development of services including Community Cloud and Industry Clouds, the integration of new and acquired technologies such as Commerce Cloud, artificial intelligence technologies and Salesforce Quip, the expansion of our Marketing Cloud, Salesforce Platform core service offerings, Integration Cloud through our May 2018 MuleSoft, Inc. (\"MuleSoft\") acquisition and the additions to our global infrastructure to support our growth. We also regularly evaluate acquisitions or investment opportunities in complementary businesses, joint ventures, services and technologies and intellectual property rights in an effort to expand our service offerings. We expect to continue to make such investments and acquisitions in the future and we plan to reinvest a significant portion of our incremental revenue in future periods to grow our business and continue our leadership role in the cloud computing industry. As part of our growth strategy, we are delivering innovative solutions in new categories, including analytics, e-commerce, artificial intelligence, IoT and collaborative productivity tools. We drive innovation organically and to a lesser extent through acquisitions, such as our acquisition of MuleSoft and in August 2018 our acquisition of Datorama, Inc. (\"Datorama\"). We have a disciplined and thoughtful acquisition process where we routinely survey the industry landscape across a wide range of companies. As a result of our aggressive growth plans and integration of our previously acquired businesses, we have incurred significant expenses from equity awards and amortization of purchased intangibles, which have reduced our operating income. We remain focused on improving operating margins. Our typical subscription contract term is 12 to 36 months, although terms range from one to 60 months, so during any fiscal reporting period only a subset of active subscription contracts is eligible for renewal. We calculate our attrition rate as of the end of each month. Our attrition rate, including the Marketing Cloud service offering but excluding our Commerce Cloud service offering and integration service offering, was less than ten percent as of January 31, 2019 . While it is difficult to predict, we expect our attrition rate to remain consistent as we continue to expand our enterprise business and invest in customer success and related programs. We expect marketing and sales costs, which were 46 percent , 44 percent and 45 percent of total revenues for fiscal 2019 , 2018 and 2017, respectively, to continue to represent a substantial portion of total revenues in the future as we seek to grow our customer base, sell more products to existing customers, and continue to build greater brand awareness. During the year, we acquired MuleSoft, an industry-leading integration platform, to provide our customers the ability to integrate data across platforms. The financial results of MuleSoft are included in our consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisition. The total purchase price for MuleSoft was approximately $6.4 billion . Also in fiscal 2019, we acquired Datorama, which provides a platform for enterprises, agencies and publishers to integrate data across marketing channels and data sources. The financial results of Datorama are included in our consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisition. The total purchase price for Datorama was approximately $766 million. Fiscal Year Our fiscal year ends on January 31. References to fiscal 2019 , for example, refer to the fiscal year ending January 31, 2019 . Adoption of New Accounting Standards We have adjusted our consolidated financial statements from amounts previously reported due to the adoption of Accounting Standards Update (\"ASU\") 2014-09, \"Revenue from Contracts with Customers (\"Topic 606\")\", which relates to revenue recognition and the capitalization of costs to acquire a revenue contract. The information presented reflects the adjusted amounts as compared to those previously reported. In addition, we have prospectively adopted Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-01, \"Financial Instrument-Overall (Subtopic 825-10)\" (\"ASU 2016-01\") and Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-16, \"Income Taxes (Topic 740): Intra-Entity Transfers of Assets Other Than Inventory\" (\"ASU 2016-16\"). See Note 1, Summary of Business and Significant Accounting Policies of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, which is incorporated herein by reference. Operating Segments We operate as one operating segment. Operating segments are defined as components of an enterprise for which separate financial information is evaluated regularly by our chief operating decision makers, Marc Benioff, who is the co-chief executive officer and the chairman of the board, and Keith Block, who is the co-chief executive officer, in deciding how to allocate resources and assess performance. Over the past few years, we have completed a number of acquisitions, including the acquisitions of MuleSoft and Datorama in fiscal 2019. These acquisitions have allowed us to expand our offerings, presence and reach in various market segments of the enterprise cloud computing market. While we have offerings in multiple enterprise cloud computing market segments, including as a result of our acquisitions, our business operates in one operating segment because most of our offerings operate on a single customer success platform and are deployed in an identical way, and our chief operating decision makers evaluate our financial information and resources and assess the performance of these resources on a consolidated basis. Since we operate as one operating segment, all required financial segment information can be found in the consolidated financial statements. In August 2018, we moved to a co-chief executive officer model with the promotion of our vice chairman and chief operating officer, Keith Block. We determined that both co-chief executive officers also serve as chief operating decision makers for the purposes of segment reporting. Despite the change in the chief operating decision maker, we determined no change to segment reporting was necessary as there was no change in the components for which separate financial information is regularly evaluated. Sources of Revenues We derive our revenues from two sources: (1) subscription revenues, which are comprised of subscription fees from customers accessing our enterprise cloud computing services (collectively, \"Cloud Services\"), software licenses, and from customers paying for additional support beyond the standard support that is included in the basic subscription fees; and (2) related professional services such as process mapping, project management, implementation services and other revenue. Other revenue consists primarily of training fees. Subscription and support revenues accounted for approximately 93 percent of our total revenues for fiscal 2019 . Subscription revenues are driven primarily by the number of paying subscribers, varying service types, and the price of our service and renewals. We define a customer as a separate and distinct buying entity (e.g., a company, a distinct business unit of a large corporation, a partnership, etc.) that has entered into a contract to access our enterprise cloud computing services. Subscription and support revenues for Cloud Services are recognized ratably over the contract terms beginning on the commencement dates of each contract. Subscription revenues for software licenses are generally recognized upfront when the software is made available to the customer. The typical subscription and support term is 12 to 36 months, although terms range from one to 60 months. Our subscription and support contracts are non-cancelable, though customers typically have the right to terminate their contracts for cause if we materially fail to perform. We generally invoice our customers in advance, in annual installments, and typical payment terms provide that our customers pay us within 30 days of invoice. Amounts that have been invoiced are recorded in accounts receivable and in unearned revenue, or in revenue depending on whether transfer of control to customers has occurred. In general, we collect our billings in advance of the subscription service period. Professional services and other revenues consist of fees associated with consulting and implementation services and training. Our consulting and implementation engagements are billed on a time and materials, fixed fee or subscription basis. We also offer a number of training classes on implementing, using and administering our service that are billed on a per person, per class basis. Our typical professional services payment terms provide that our customers pay us within 30 days of invoice. In determining whether professional services can be accounted for separately from subscription and support revenues, we consider a number of factors, which are described in Note 1 \"Summary of Business and Significant Accounting Policies\" of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, which is incorporated herein by reference. Revenue by Cloud Service Offering The information below is provided on a supplemental basis to give additional insight into the revenue performance of our individual core service offerings. All of the cloud offerings that we offer to customers are grouped into four major cloud service offerings. Subscription and support revenues consisted of the following (in millions): ##TABLE_START  Fiscal Year Ended January 31,         Variance - Percent Fiscal 2018 and 2019  Variance - Percent Fiscal 2017 and 2018 Sales Cloud $ 4,040  $ 3,588  $ 3,076  13%  17% Service Cloud 3,621  2,883  2,343  26%  23% Salesforce Platform and Other 2,854  1,913  1,433  49%  33% Marketing and Commerce Cloud 1,898  1,382   37%  46% Total $ 12,413  $ 9,766  $ 7,799     ##TABLE_ENDSubscription and support revenues from the Community Cloud, Quip and our Industry Offerings were not significant in fiscal 2019 . Quip revenue is included with Salesforce Platform and Other in the table above. Our Industry Offerings and Community Cloud revenue are included in either Sales Cloud, Service Cloud or Salesforce Platform and Other depending on the primary service offering purchased. Revenue from our acquisition of MuleSoft in May 2018 is included in Salesforce Platform and Other. As required under U.S. GAAP, we recorded unearned revenue related to acquired contracts from MuleSoft at fair value on the date of acquisition. As a result, we did not recognize certain revenues related to these acquired contracts that MuleSoft would have otherwise recorded as an independent entity. Of the $2.9 billion subscription and support revenue for Salesforce Platform and Other for fiscal 2019 , approximately $360 million was attributed to MuleSoft. In situations where a customer purchases multiple cloud offerings, such as through an Enterprise License Agreement, we allocate the contract value to each core service offering based on the customers estimated product demand plan, the service that was provided at the inception of the contract, and standalone selling price (\"SSP\") of those products. We do not update these allocations based on actual product usage during the term of the contract. We have allocated approximately 17 percent , 15 percent , 13 percent of our total subscription and support revenues for fiscal 2019 , 2018 and 2017, respectively, based on customers estimated product demand plans and these allocated amounts are included in the table above. Additionally, some of our service offerings have similar features and functions. For example, customers may use the Sales Cloud, the Service Cloud or the Salesforce Platform to record account and contact information, which are similar features across these core service offerings. Depending on a customers actual and projected business requirements, more than one core service offering may satisfy the customers current and future needs. We record revenue based on the individual products ordered by a customer, not according to the customers business requirements and usage. In addition, as we introduce new features and functions within each offering and refine our allocation methodology for changes in our business, we do not expect it to be practical to adjust historical revenue results by service offering for comparability. Accordingly, comparisons of revenue performance by core service offering over time may not be meaningful. Our Sales Cloud service offering is our most widely distributed service offering and has historically been the largest contributor of subscription and support revenues. As a result, Sales Cloud has the most international exposure and foreign exchange rate exposure relative to the other cloud service offerings. Conversely, revenue for Marketing and Commerce Cloud is primarily derived from the Americas with little impact from foreign exchange rate movement. The revenue growth rates of each of our core service offerings fluctuate from quarter to quarter and over time. While we are a market leader in each core offering, we manage the total balanced product portfolio to deliver solutions to our customers. Accordingly, the revenue result for each cloud service offering is not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for any subsequent quarter. Seasonal Nature of Unearned Revenue, Accounts Receivable and Operating Cash Flow Unearned revenue primarily consists of billings to customers for our subscription service. Over 90 percent of the value of our billings to customers is for our subscription and support service. We generally invoice our customers in annual cycles. We typically issue renewal invoices in advance of the renewal service period, and depending on timing, the initial invoice for the subscription and services contract and the subsequent renewal invoice may occur in different quarters. This may result in an increase in unearned revenue and accounts receivable. There is a disproportionate weighting toward annual billings in the fourth quarter, primarily as a result of large enterprise account buying patterns. Our fourth quarter has historically been our strongest quarter for new business and renewals. The year on year compounding effect of this seasonality in both billing patterns and overall new and renewal business causes the value of invoices that we generate in the fourth quarter for both new business and renewals to increase as a proportion of our total annual billings. Accordingly, because of this billing activity, our first quarter is typically our largest collections and operating cash flow quarter. The sequential quarterly changes in accounts receivable and the related unearned revenue and operating cash flow during the first quarter of our fiscal year are not necessarily indicative of the billing activity that occurs for the following quarters as displayed below (in millions ): ##TABLE_START  January 31, 2019  October 31, 2018  July 31, 2018  April 30, 2018 Fiscal 2019        Accounts receivable, net $ 4,924  $ 2,037  $ 1,980  $ 1,763 Unearned revenue 8,564  5,376  5,883  6,201 Operating cash flow 1,331    1,466 ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  January 31, 2018  October 31, 2017  July 31, 2017  April 30, 2017 Fiscal 2018        Accounts receivable, net $ 3,921  $ 1,522  $ 1,572  $ 1,442 Unearned revenue 6,995  4,312  4,749  4,969 Operating cash flow 1,052    1,230 ##TABLE_ENDThe unearned revenue balance on our consolidated balance sheets does not represent the total contract value of annual or multi-year, non-cancelable subscription agreements. Transaction price allocated to the remaining performance obligations (\"Remaining Performance Obligation\") represents contracted revenue that has not yet been recognized, which includes unearned revenue and unbilled amounts that will be recognized as revenue in future periods. Remaining performance obligation is not necessarily indicative of future revenue growth and is influenced by several factors, including seasonality, the timing of renewals, average contract terms and foreign currency exchange rates. Unbilled portions of the remaining performance obligation denominated in foreign currencies are revalued each period based on the period end exchange rates. For multi-year subscription agreements billed annually, the associated unbilled balance and corresponding remaining performance obligation is typically high at the beginning of the contract period, zero just prior to renewal, and increases if the agreement is renewed. Low remaining performance obligations attributable to a particular subscription agreement are often associated with an impending renewal and may not be an indicator of the likelihood of renewal or future revenue from such customer. Remaining performance obligation, formerly referred to as remaining transaction price, consisted of the following (in billions): ##TABLE_START  Current  Noncurrent  Total As of January 31, 2019 $ 11.9  $ 13.8  $ 25.7 * As of October 31, 2018 $ 10.0  $ 11.2  $ 21.2 As of July 31, 2018 $ 9.8  $ 11.2  $ 21.0 As of April 30, 2018 $ 9.6  $ 10.8  $ 20.4 As of January 31, 2018 $ 9.6  $ 11.0  $ 20.6 ##TABLE_END*Includes $500 million of remaining performance obligation related to fiscal 2019 acquisitions, including contracts executed subsequent to acquisition. Cost of Revenues and Operating Expenses Cost of Revenues Cost of subscription and support revenues primarily consists of expenses related to delivering our service and providing support, the costs of data center capacity, depreciation or operating lease expense associated with computer equipment and software, allocated overhead, amortization expense associated with capitalized software related to our services and acquired developed technologies and certain fees paid to various third parties for the use of their technology, services and data. We allocate overhead such as IT infrastructure, rent, and occupancy charges based on headcount. Employee benefit costs and taxes are allocated based upon a percentage of total compensation expense. As such, general overhead expenses are reflected in each cost of revenue and operating expense category. Cost of professional services and other revenues consists primarily of employee-related costs associated with these services, including stock-based expenses, the cost of subcontractors, certain third-party fees and allocated overhead. The cost of providing professional services is higher as a percentage of the related revenue than for our enterprise cloud computing subscription service due to the direct labor costs and costs of subcontractors. We intend to continue to invest additional resources in our enterprise cloud computing services. For example, we have invested in additional database software and hardware and we plan to increase the capacity that we are able to offer globally through data centers and third-party infrastructure providers. In addition, we intend to continue to invest additional resources in enhancing our cyber security measures. As we acquire new businesses and technologies, the amortization expense associated with the purchase of acquired developed technology will be included in cost of revenues. Additionally, as we enter into new contracts with third parties for the use of their technology, services or data, or as our sales volume grows, the fees paid to use such technology or services may increase. Finally, we expect the cost of professional services to be approximately in line with revenues from professional services as we believe this investment in professional services facilitates the adoption of our service offerings. The timing of these additional expenses will affect our cost of revenues, both in terms of absolute dollars and as a percentage of revenues, in the affected periods. Research and Development Research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries and related expenses, including stock-based expenses, the costs of our development and test data center and allocated overhead. We continue to focus our research and development efforts on adding new features and services, integrating acquired technologies, increasing the functionality and security and enhancing the ease of use of our enterprise cloud computing services. Our proprietary, scalable and secure multi-tenant architecture enables us to provide our customers with a service based on a single version of our application. As a result, we do not have to maintain multiple versions, which enables us to have relatively lower research and development expenses as compared to traditional enterprise software companies. We expect that in the future, research and development expenses will increase in absolute dollars and may increase as a percentage of total revenues as we invest in adding employees and building the necessary system infrastructure required to support the development of new, and improve existing, technologies and the integration of acquired businesses, technologies and all of our service offerings. Marketing and Sales  Marketing and sales expenses are our largest cost and consist primarily of salaries and related expenses, including stock-based expenses, for our sales and marketing staff, including commissions, as well as payments to partners, marketing programs and allocated overhead. Marketing programs consist of advertising, events, corporate communications, brand building and product marketing activities. We plan to continue to invest in marketing and sales by expanding our domestic and international selling and marketing activities, building brand awareness, attracting new customers, and sponsoring additional marketing events. The timing of these marketing events, such as our annual and largest event, Dreamforce, will affect our marketing costs in a particular quarter. In addition, as we acquire new businesses and technologies, a component of the amortization expense associated with this activity will be included in marketing and sales. We expect that in the future, marketing and sales expenses will increase in absolute dollars and continue to be our largest cost. We expect marketing and sales expenses, excluding sales personnel expenses, to grow in line with or at a slower rate than revenues and sales personnel expenses. These may increase as a percentage of total revenues as we invest in additional sales personnel to focus on adding new customers and increasing penetration within our existing customer base. General and Administrative  General and administrative expenses consist of salaries and related expenses, including stock-based expenses, for finance and accounting, legal, internal audit, human resources and management information systems personnel, legal costs, security costs, professional fees, other corporate expenses such as transaction costs for acquisitions and allocated overhead. We expect that in the future, general and administrative expenses will increase in absolute dollars as we invest in our infrastructure and we incur additional employee related costs, professional fees and insurance costs related to the growth of our business and international expansion. We expect general and administrative costs as a percentage of total revenues to either remain flat or decrease for the next several quarters. However, the timing of additional expenses in a particular quarter, both in terms of absolute dollars and as a percentage of revenues, will affect our general and administrative expenses. Stock-Based Expenses  Our cost of revenues and operating expenses include stock-based expenses related to equity plans for employees and non-employee directors. We recognize our stock-based compensation as an expense in the statements of operations based on their fair values and vesting periods. These charges have been significant in the past and we expect that they will increase as our stock price increases, as we acquire more companies, as we hire more employees and seek to retain existing employees. Amortization of Purchased Intangible Assets Acquired Through Business Combinations Our cost of revenues, operating expenses and other expenses include amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets, such as the amortization of the cost associated with an acquired companys developed technology, trade names and trademarks, and customer relationships. We expect this expense to fluctuate as we acquire more businesses and intangible assets become fully amortized. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, costs and expenses, and related disclosures. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates and assumptions. Our actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. We believe that of our significant accounting policies, which are described in Note 1 Summary of Business and Significant Accounting Policies to our consolidated financial statements, the following accounting policies and specific estimates involve a greater degree of judgment and complexity. Revenue Recognition -  Contracts with Multiple Performance Obligations. We enter into contracts with our customers that may include promises to transfer multiple Cloud Services, software licenses, premium support and professional services. A performance obligation is a promise in a contract with a customer to transfer products or services that are distinct. Determining whether products and services are distinct performance obligations that should be accounted for separately or combined as one unit of accounting may require significant judgment. Cloud Services and software licenses are distinct as such offerings are often sold separately. In determining whether professional services are distinct, we consider the following factors for each professional services agreement: availability of the services from other vendors, the nature of the professional services, the timing of when the professional services contract was signed in comparison to the subscription start date and the contractual dependence of the service on the customers satisfaction with the professional services work. To date, we have concluded that all of the professional services included in contracts with multiple performance obligations are distinct. We allocate the transaction price to each performance obligation on a relative standalone selling price (\"SSP\") basis. The SSP is the price at which we would sell a promised product or service separately to a customer. Judgment is required to determine the SSP for each distinct performance obligation. We determine SSP by considering our overall pricing objectives and market conditions. Significant pricing practices taken into consideration include our discounting practices, the size and volume of our transactions, the customer demographic, the geographic area where services are sold, price lists, our go-to-market strategy, historical sales and contract prices. As our go-to-market strategies evolve, we may modify our pricing practices in the future, which could result in changes to SSP. In certain cases, we are able to establish SSP based on observable prices of products or services sold separately in comparable circumstances to similar customers. We use a single amount to estimate SSP when it has observable prices. If SSP is not directly observable, for example when pricing is highly variable, we use a range of SSP. We determine the SSP range using information that may include market conditions or other observable inputs. We typically have more than one SSP for individual products and services due to the stratification of those products and services by customer size and geography. Costs Capitalized to Obtain Revenue Contracts. Costs capitalized related to new revenue contracts are amortized on a straight-line basis over four years, which, although longer than the typical initial contract period, reflects the average period of benefit, including expected contract renewals. Significant judgment is required in arriving at this average period of benefit. Therefore, we evaluate both qualitative and quantitative factors which include the estimated life cycles of our offerings and our customer attrition. Business Combinations. Accounting for business combinations requires us to make significant estimates and assumptions, especially at the acquisition date with respect to tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed and pre-acquisition contingencies. We use our best estimates and assumptions to accurately assign fair value to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date as well as the useful lives of those acquired intangible assets. Examples of critical estimates in valuing certain of the intangible assets and goodwill we have acquired include but are not limited to: ##TABLE_START  future expected cash flows from subscription and support contracts, professional services contracts, other customer contracts and acquired developed technologies and patents; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  the acquired companys trade name and existing customer relationships, as well as assumptions about the period of time the acquired trade name will continue to be used in our offerings; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  uncertain tax positions and tax related valuation allowances assumed; and ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  discount rates. ##TABLE_END Unanticipated events and circumstances may occur that may affect the accuracy or validity of such assumptions, estimates or actual results. Income Taxes. Valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amounts that are more likely than not expected to be realized based on the weighting of positive and negative evidence. Future realization of deferred tax assets ultimately depends on the existence of sufficient taxable income of the appropriate character, for example, ordinary income or capital gain, within the carryback or carryforward periods available under the applicable tax law. We regularly review the deferred tax assets for recoverability based on historical taxable income, projected future taxable income, the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences and tax planning strategies. Our judgment regarding future profitability may change due to many factors, including future market conditions and the ability to successfully execute our business plans and tax planning strategies. Should there be a change in the ability to recover deferred tax assets, our income tax provision would increase or decrease in the period in which the assessment is changed. Our tax positions are subject to income tax audits by multiple tax jurisdictions throughout the world. We recognize the tax benefit of an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the position is sustainable upon examination by the taxing authority, based on the technical merits. The tax benefit recognized is measured as the largest amount of benefit which is greater than 50 percent likely to be realized upon settlement with the taxing authority. We recognize interest accrued and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in our income tax provision. Strategic Investments. Accounting for strategic investments in privately held debt and equity securities in which we do not have a controlling interest or significant influence requires us to make significant estimates and assumptions. Privately held equity securities without a readily determinable fair value are recorded at cost and adjusted for observable price changes in a same or similar security from the same issuer and impairments. Privately held debt and equity securities are valued using significant unobservable inputs or data in an inactive market and the valuation requires our judgment due to the absence of market prices and inherent lack of liquidity. The carrying value is adjusted for our privately held equity securities if there are observable price changes in a same or similar security from the same issuer or if there are identified events or changes in circumstances that may indicate impairment, as discussed below. The determination of whether an orderly transaction is for a same or similar investment requires significant management judgment including the nature of rights and obligations of the investments, the extent to which differences in those rights and obligations would affect the fair values of those investments, and the impact of any differences based on the stage of operational development of the investee. We assess our privately held debt and equity securities strategic investment portfolio quarterly for impairment. Our impairment analysis encompasses an assessment of the severity and duration of the impairment and qualitative and quantitative analysis of other key factors including the investees financial metrics, the investees products and technologies meeting or exceeding predefined milestones, market acceptance of the product or technology, other competitive products or technology in the market, general market conditions, management and governance structure of the investee, the investees liquidity, debt ratios and the rate at which the investee is using its cash. If the investment is considered to be impaired, we record the investment at fair value by recognizing an impairment through the consolidated statement of operations and establishing a new carrying value for the investment.

The following table sets forth selected balance sheet and other metrics data for each of the periods indicated (in millions, other than remaining performance obligation, which is presented in billions): ##TABLE_START  As of January 31,   Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities $ 4,342  $ 4,521 Unearned revenue 8,564  6,995 Remaining performance obligation 25.7  20.6 Principal due on our outstanding debt obligations 3,198  1,727 ##TABLE_ENDRemaining performance obligation represents contracted revenue that has not yet been recognized, which includes unearned revenue and unbilled amounts that will be recognized as revenue in future periods. Fiscal Year Ended January 31, 2019 and 2018 Revenues. ##TABLE_START  Fiscal Year Ended January 31,  Variance (in millions)   Dollars  Percent Subscription and support $ 12,413  $ 9,766  $ 2,647  % Professional services and other    Total revenues $ 13,282  $ 10,540  $ 2,742  ##TABLE_ENDThe increase in subscription and support revenues was primarily caused by volume-driven increases from new business, which includes new customers, upgrades and additional subscriptions from existing customers. Our acquisition of MuleSoft in May 2018 contributed $431 million to total revenues in fiscal 2019 . The increase was also driven by approximately $227 million of revenue recognized at a point in time, which includes the portion of software subscriptions allocated to the on-premise software element. We continue to invest in a variety of customer programs and initiatives which, along with increasing enterprise adoption, have helped keep our attrition rate consistent as compared to the prior year. Consistent attrition rates play a role in our ability to maintain growth in our subscription and support revenues. Changes in the net price per user per month have not been a significant driver of revenue growth for the periods presented. The increase in professional services and other revenues was due primarily to the higher demand for services from an increased number of customers. Revenues  by geography were as follows : ##TABLE_START  Fiscal Year Ended January 31, (in millions)  As a % of Total Revenues   As a % of Total Revenues  Growth rate Americas $ 9,445  %  $ 7,621  %  % Europe 2,553   1,916   Asia Pacific 1,284   1,003    $ 13,282  %  $ 10,540  %  ##TABLE_ENDRevenues by geography are determined based on the region of the Salesforce contracting entity, which may be different than the region of the customer. Americas revenue attributed to the United States was approximately 96 percent during fiscal year 2019 and 2018 . Revenues in Europe and Asia Pacific accounted for $3.8 billion , or 29 percent of total revenues, for fiscal 2019 , compared to $2.9 billion , or 28 percent of total revenues, during the same period a year ago, an increase of $0.9 billion , or 31 percent . The increase in revenues outside of the Americas was the result of the increasing acceptance of our services, our focus on marketing our services internationally and investment in additional international resources. Revenues outside of the Americas increased on a total dollar basis by $39 million in fiscal 2019 compared to fiscal 2018 due to foreign currency fluctuations primarily as a result of the strengthening British Pound Sterling. Cost of Revenues. ##TABLE_START  Fiscal Year Ended January 31,  Variance Dollars (in millions)   Subscription and support $ 2,604  $ 2,033  $ Professional services and other   Total cost of revenues $ 3,451  $ 2,773  $ Percent of total revenues %  %   ##TABLE_ENDThe increase in cost of revenues was primarily due to an increase of $156 million in employee-related costs, an increase of $31 million in stock-based expenses, an increase of $326 million in service delivery costs, primarily due to our efforts to increase data center capacity, an increase of amortization of purchased intangible assets of $49 million and an increase of $26 million in allocated overhead. We have increased our headcount by 16 percent since January 31, 2018 to meet the higher demand for services from our customers, of which a component was also due to the acquisition of MuleSoft in May 2018. We intend to continue to invest additional resources in our enterprise cloud computing services and data center capacity to allow us to scale with our customers and continuously evolve our security measures. We also plan to add employees in our professional services group to facilitate the adoption of our services. The timing of these expenses will affect our cost of revenues, both in terms of absolute dollars and as a percentage of revenues, in future periods. The cost of professional services and other revenues was $847 million during fiscal 2019 resulting in positive gross margin of $22 million . The cost of professional services and other revenues was $740 million during fiscal 2018 resulting in positive gross margins of $34 million . We expect the cost of professional services to be approximately in line with revenues from professional services in future fiscal quarters. We believe that this investment in professional services facilitates the adoption of our service offerings. Operating Expenses. ##TABLE_START  Fiscal Year Ended January 31,  Variance Dollars (in millions)   Research and development $ 1,886  $ 1,553  $ Marketing and sales 6,064  4,671  1,393 General and administrative 1,346  1,089  Total operating expenses $ 9,296  $ 7,313  $ 1,983 Percent of total revenues %  %   ##TABLE_ENDThe increase in research and development expenses was primarily due to an increase of approximately $216 million in employee-related costs, an increase of $47 million in stock-based expenses, an increase in our development and test data center costs and allocated overhead. We increased our research and development headcount by 19 percent since January 31, 2018 in order to improve and extend our service offerings, develop new technologies, and integrate acquired companies, including our acquisition of MuleSoft in May 2018. Additionally, a component of our increased headcount was also due to the acquisition of MuleSoft. We expect that research and development expenses will increase in absolute dollars and may increase as a percentage of revenues in future periods as we continue to invest in additional employees and technology to support the development of new, and improve existing, technologies and the integration of acquired technologies. The increase in marketing and sales expenses was primarily due to an increase of $797 million in employee-related costs and amortization of deferred commissions, an increase of $174 million in stock-based expenses, an increase in amortization of purchased intangible assets of $111 million , and allocated overhead. Our marketing and sales headcount increased by 25 percent since January 31, 2018 , of which a component was due to the acquisition of MuleSoft in May 2018. The increase in headcount was primarily attributable to hiring additional sales personnel to focus on adding new customers and increasing penetration within our existing customer base. We expect that marketing and sales expenses will increase in absolute dollars and may increase as a percentage of revenues in future periods as we continue to hire additional sales personnel. The increase in general and administrative expenses was primarily due to an increase in employee-related costs. Our general and administrative headcount increased by 27 percent since January 31, 2018 as we added personnel to support our growth as well as an increase due to the acquisition of MuleSoft in May 2018. Other income and expense. ##TABLE_START  Fiscal Year Ended January 31,  Variance Dollars (in millions)   Investment income $  $  $ Interest expense (154 )  (87 )  (67 ) Gains on strategic investments, net   Other income (expense)  (2 )  ##TABLE_ENDThe increase in investment income was due to higher interest income across our portfolio, which is primarily a result of increasing interest rates. Interest expense consists of interest on our debt, capital leases, and financing obligation related to 350 Mission. The increase in interest expense was primarily driven by interest expense on the 2023 Senior Notes and 2028 Senior Notes of approximately $71 million . We expect interest expense to increase in future years as the 2023 Senior Notes and 2028 Senior Notes will be outstanding for a full year as compared to a partial year in fiscal 2019. Gains on strategic investments, net consists primarily of mark-to-market adjustments related to our publicly held equity securities, observable price adjustments related to our privately held equity securities and other adjustments. The prospective adoption of ASU 2016-01 resulted in unrealized gains in our equity securities of approximately $446 million during fiscal 2019 , excluding gains on sales of equity securities. These gains were primarily driven by mark-to-market adjustments to our publicly traded securities of $345 million during fiscal 2019 . Other income (expense) primarily consists of non-operating transactions such as gains and losses from foreign exchange rate fluctuations and real estate transactions.

The tax benefit recorded was primarily related to the release of our valuation allowance related to federal and state deferred tax assets, which was partially offset with the increase in unrecognized tax benefits. In addition, we recorded current tax expense for profitable jurisdictions outside of the United States. In fiscal 2018 , we recorded a tax provision of $60 million on a pretax income of $420 million . The tax provision recorded was primarily related to income taxes in profitable jurisdictions outside of the United States. Fiscal Years Ended January 31, 2018 and 2017 Revenues. ##TABLE_START  Fiscal Year Ended January 31,  Variance (in millions)   Dollars  Percent Subscription and support $ 9,766  $ 7,799  $ 1,967  % Professional services and other    Total revenues $ 10,540  $ 8,437  $ 2,103  ##TABLE_ENDThe increase in subscription and support revenues during fiscal 2018 was primarily caused by volume-driven increases from new business, which included new customers, upgrades and additional subscriptions from existing customers. Additionally, fiscal 2018 benefited from a full year of revenue from Demandware, which we acquired in July 2016. This was offset by a reduction in subscription revenues of approximately $20 million as a result of one less day in fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017. We continue to invest in a variety of customer programs and initiatives which, along with increasing enterprise adoption, have helped keep our attrition rate consistent as compared to the prior year. Consistent attrition rates play a role in our ability to maintain growth in our subscription and support revenues. Changes in the net price per user per month have not been a significant driver of revenue growth for the periods presented. The increase in professional services and other revenues was due primarily to the higher demand for services from an increased number of customers. Revenues by geography were as follows (in millions): ##TABLE_START  Fiscal Year Ended January 31,     As a % of Total Revenues   As a % of Total Revenues  Growth rate Americas $ 7,621  %  $ 6,259  %  % Europe 1,916   1,383  %  Asia Pacific 1,003    %   $ 10,540  %  $ 8,437  %  ##TABLE_ENDRevenues by geography are determined based on the region of the Salesforce contracting entity, which may be different than the region of the customer. Americas revenue attributed to the United States was approximately 96 percent during fiscal 2018 and 2017. Revenues in Europe and Asia Pacific accounted for $2.9 billion, or 28 percent of total revenues, for fiscal 2018, compared to $2.2 billion, or 26 percent of total revenues, during fiscal 2017, an increase of $0.7 billion, or 34 percent. The increase in revenues outside of the Americas was the result of the increasing acceptance of our services, our focus on marketing our services internationally and investment in additional international resources. Revenues outside of the Americas increased on a total dollar basis by $96 million in fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017 due to foreign currency fluctuations primarily as a result of the strengthening British Pound Sterling.

We increased our headcount by 11 percent during fiscal 2018 to meet the higher demand for services from our customers and as a result of our fiscal 2017 acquisitions. The cost of professional services and other revenues was $740 million during fiscal 2018 resulting in positive gross margin of $34 million. The cost of professional services and other revenues was $617 million during fiscal 2017 resulting in positive gross margins of $21 million.

We increased our research and development headcount by 11 percent during fiscal 2018 in order to improve and extend our service offerings, develop new technologies and integrate previously acquired companies, including our fiscal 2017 acquisitions. The change in marketing and sales expenses was primarily due to an increase of $637 million in employee-related costs and amortization of deferred commissions, an increase of $80 million in stock-based expenses, an increase in amortization of purchased intangible assets of $23 million and allocated overhead. Our marketing and sales headcount increased by 22 percent during fiscal 2018. The increase in headcount was primarily attributable to hiring additional sales personnel to focus on adding new customers and increasing penetration within our existing customer base. The increase in general and administrative expenses was primarily due to an increase in employee-related costs. Our general and administrative headcount increased by 16 percent during fiscal 2018 as we added personnel to support our growth.

Interest expense consists of interest on our convertible senior notes, capital leases, financing obligation related to 350 Mission, the loan assumed on 50 Fremont, revolving credit facility and the $500 million term loan that was entered into in connection with our acquisition of Demandware. Gains on strategic investments, net represents strategic investments' fair market value adjustments and gains recognized related to strategic investments when we acquire an entity in which we previously held a strategic investment. The difference between the fair value of the shares as of the date of the acquisition and the carrying value of the strategic investment is recorded as a gain or loss. The change in gains on strategic investments, net was primarily due to $14 million of gains resulting from our acquisition of companies in which we held strategic investments in fiscal 2017. Other income (expense) primarily consists of non-operating transactions such as gains and losses from foreign exchange rate fluctuations and real estate transactions. Benefit from (provision for) income taxes. ##TABLE_START  Fiscal Year Ended January 31,  Variance Dollars (in millions)   Benefit from (provision for) income taxes $ (60 )  $  $ (204 ) Effective tax rate %  (80 )%   ##TABLE_ENDWe recognized a tax provision of $60 million on a pretax income of $420 million for fiscal 2018. The tax provision recorded was primarily related to income taxes in profitable jurisdictions outside of the United States. In fiscal 2017, we recorded a tax benefit of $144 million on a pretax income of $179 million for fiscal 2017. The most significant component of this tax amount was the discrete tax benefit of $210 million from a partial release of the valuation allowance in connection with the acquisition of Demandware. The net deferred tax liability from the acquisition of Demandware provided a source of additional income to support the realizability of our pre-existing deferred tax assets and, as a result, we released a portion of our valuation allowance. The tax benefit associated with the release of the valuation allowance was partially offset by income taxes in profitable jurisdictions outside of the United States. Liquidity and Capital Resources At January 31, 2019 , our principal sources of liquidity were cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaling $4.3 billion and accounts receivable of $4.9 billion . Our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities are comprised primarily of corporate notes and obligations, U.S. treasury securities, asset backed securities, foreign government obligations, mortgage backed obligations, time deposits, money market mutual funds and municipal securities. As of January 31, 2019 , our remaining performance obligation was $25.7 billion . Our remaining performance obligation represents contracted revenue that has not yet been recognized and includes unearned revenue, which has been invoiced and is recorded on the balance sheet, and unbilled amounts that are not recorded on the balance sheet, that will be recognized as revenue in future periods. We believe our existing cash, cash equivalents, marketable securities, cash provided by operating activities and, if necessary, our borrowing capacity under our Credit Facility and unbilled amounts related to contracted non-cancelable subscription agreements, which is not reflected on the balance sheet, will be sufficient to meet our working capital, capital expenditure and debt repayment needs over the next 12 months. In the future, we may enter into arrangements to acquire or invest in complementary businesses, services and technologies, and intellectual property rights. To facilitate these acquisitions or investments, we may seek additional equity or debt financing, which may not be available on terms favorable to us or at all, which may affect our ability to complete subsequent acquisitions or investments. Cash Flows For fiscal 2019 , 2018 and 2017, our cash flows were as follows (in millions): ##TABLE_START 4 Fiscal Year Ended January 31,    Net cash provided by operating activities $ 3,398  $ 2,738  $ 2,162 Net cash used in investing activities (5,308 )  (2,011 )  (2,684 ) Net cash provided by financing activities 2,010   ##TABLE_ENDCash provided by operating activities has historically been affected by the amount of net income adjusted for non-cash expense items such as depreciation and amortization; amortization of purchased intangibles from business combinations; the expense associated with stock-based awards; net gains on strategic investments; the timing of employee related costs including commissions and bonus payments; the timing of payments against accounts payable, accrued expenses and other current liabilities; the timing of our semi-annual interest payments related to our senior notes; the timing of collections from our customers, which is our largest source of operating cash flows; the timing of business combination activity and the related integration and transaction costs; and changes in working capital accounts. Net cash provided by operating activities was also impacted by payments made during fiscal 2019 for the transaction fees related to the acquisition of MuleSoft. Our working capital accounts consist of accounts receivable, costs capitalized to obtain revenue contracts, prepaid assets and other current assets. Claims against working capital include accounts payable, accrued expenses, unearned revenue, and other current liabilities and payments related to our debt obligations. Our working capital may be impacted by factors in future periods such as billings to customers for subscriptions and support services, and the subsequent collection of those billings, certain amounts and timing of which are seasonal. Our working capital in some quarters may be impacted by adverse foreign currency exchange rate movements and this impact may increase as our working capital balances increase in our foreign subsidiaries. Our billings are also influenced by new business linearity within the quarters and across the quarters. As described above in Seasonal Nature of Unearned Revenue, Accounts Receivable and Operating Cash Flow, our fourth quarter has historically been our strongest quarter for new business and renewals and, correspondingly, the first quarter has historically been the strongest for cash collections. The year on year compounding effect of this seasonality in both billing patterns and overall business causes both the value of invoices that we generate in the fourth quarter and cash collections in the first quarter to increase as a proportion of our total annual billings. We generally invoice our customers for our subscription and services contracts in advance in annual installments. We typically issue renewal invoices in advance of the renewal service period, and depending on timing, the initial invoice for the subscription and services contract and the subsequent renewal invoice may occur in different quarters. Such invoice amounts are initially reflected in accounts receivable and unearned revenue, which is reflected on the balance sheets, and as the next billing cycle approaches, the corresponding unearned revenue decreases to zero. The operating cash flow benefit of increased billing activity generally occurs in the subsequent quarter when we collect from our customers. As such, our first quarter is our largest collections and operating cash flow quarter. The net cash used in investing activities during fiscal 2019 primarily related to the acquisitions of MuleSoft, Datorama and CloudCraze, net of cash acquired for a total of $5.1 billion . Net cash used in investing activities also included purchases of marketable securities of $1.1 billion , purchases of strategic investments of $362 million and new office build outs and capital investments of $595 million , offset by sales of marketable securities of $1.4 billion . The net cash used in investing activities during fiscal 2018 primarily related to purchases of marketable securities of $2.0 billion , new office build-outs and capital investments of $534 million , which were offset by the cash inflows for the period from sales and maturities of marketable securities of $636 million . The net cash used in investing activities during fiscal 2017 primarily related to business combinations with the largest being the acquisition of Demandware in July 2016 and purchases of marketable securities, which were offset by the cash inflows for the period from sales and maturities of marketable securities. Net cash provided by financing activities during fiscal 2019 consisted primarily of $3.0 billion from proceeds from issuance of debt which were used in the acquisition of MuleSoft, and $704 million from proceeds from equity plans, offset by $1.5 billion of repayments of debt including principal payments on the maturity of the 0.25% Senior Notes and the early repayment and termination of the 2019 Term Loan. Net cash provided by financing activities during fiscal 2018 consisted primarily of $650 million from proceeds from equity plans offset by $323 million in repayments of debt. Net cash provided by financing activities during fiscal 2017 consisted primarily of proceeds from issuance of debt, which were used to partially fund acquisitions, offset by repayments of debt. Debt The carrying values of our borrowings were as follows (in millions ): ##TABLE_START Instrument  Date of issuance  Maturity date  Effective interest rate for fiscal 2019  January 31, 2019  January 31, 2018 2021 Term Loan  May 2018  May 2021  3.05%  $  $ 2023 Senior Notes  April 2018  April 2023  3.26%   2028 Senior Notes  April 2018  April 2028  3.70%  1,488  2019 Term Loan  July 2016  July 2019  2.96%   Loan assumed on 50 Fremont  February 2015  June 2023  3.75%   0.25% Convertible Senior Notes  March 2013  April 2018  2.53%   1,023 Total carrying value of debt        3,176  1,720 Less current portion of debt        (3 )  (1,025 ) Total noncurrent debt        $ 3,173  $ ##TABLE_ENDAs of January 31, 2019 , we have senior unsecured debt outstanding due in 2021, 2023 and 2028 with a total carrying value of $3.0 billion . In addition, we have senior secured notes outstanding related to our loan on 50 Fremont due in 2023 with a total carrying value of $196 million . We were in compliance with all debt covenants as of January 31, 2019 . We maintain a revolving loan credit agreement that provides for $1.0 billion unsecured financing (\"Credit Facility\") that matures in April 2023. We may use the proceeds of future borrowings under the Credit Facility for refinancing other indebtedness, working capital, capital expenditures and other general corporate purposes, including permitted acquisitions. There were no outstanding borrowings under the Credit Facility as of January 31, 2019 . As of January 31, 2019 , we have a total of $92 million in letters of credit outstanding in favor of certain landlords for office space. To date, no amounts have been drawn against the letters of credit, which renew annually and expire at various dates through December 2030. We do not have any special purpose entities, and other than operating leases for office space and computer equipment, we do not engage in off-balance sheet financing arrangements. Contractual Obligations Our principal commitments consist of obligations under leases for office space, co-location data center facilities and our development and test data center, as well as leases for computer equipment, software, furniture and fixtures, excluding all secured and unsecured debt. At January 31, 2019 , the future non-cancelable minimum payments under these commitments were as follows (in millions ): ##TABLE_START  Payments Due by Period  Total  Less than 1 Year  1-3 Years  3-5 Years  More than 5 Years Capital lease obligations, including interest $  $  $  $  $ Operating lease obligations:          Facilities space 3,473     1,610 Computer equipment and furniture and fixtures     Financing obligation - leased facility     Lease obligation - buildings to be constructed     2021 Term loan     2023 Senior Notes 1,000    1,000  2028 Senior Notes 1,500     1,500 Loan assumed on 50 Fremont     Contractual commitments 1,867      $ 10,694  $ 1,281  $ 2,400  $ 2,697  $ 4,316 ##TABLE_ENDThe majority of our operating lease agreements provide us with the option to renew. Our future operating lease obligations would change if we exercised these options and if we entered into additional operating lease agreements as we expand our operations. The financing obligation - leased facility above represents the total obligation for our lease of approximately 445,000 rentable square feet of office space at 350 Mission St. (\"350 Mission\") in San Francisco, California. As of January 31, 2019 , $215 million of the total obligation noted above was recorded to Financing obligation - leased facility, of which the current portion is included in Accrued expenses and other liabilities and the noncurrent portion is included in Other noncurrent liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets. The lease obligation - buildings to be constructed above represents the total obligation for two separate agreements for office facilities we entered into during fiscal 2019 . The first agreement is for approximately 324,000 rentable square feet of office space in a building to be constructed as part of our urban campus in San Francisco, California. We expect to begin occupying the space in fiscal 2024 and the total non-cancelable minimum payments under this agreement are approximately $480 million over 16 years . Construction has not commenced on the building and is dependent on the developer obtaining approvals from the City and County of San Francisco. The second agreement is for approximately 603,000 rentable square feet of office space in a building to be constructed in Chicago, Illinois. We expect to begin occupying the space in fiscal 2022 and the total non-cancelable minimum payments under this agreement are approximately $475 million over 17 years . As of January 31, 2019 construction has not commenced on either of these buildings and the timing of completion of construction is unknown. Due to this uncertainty, the entire commitment for these two obligations is reflected as payments due in more than five years in the table above. We have entered into various contractual commitments with infrastructure service providers for a total commitment of $2.0 billion , which are reflected in the table above under \"contractual commitments.\" As of January 31, 2019 , the total remaining commitment is approximately $1.8 billion and $264 million is due in the next fiscal year. Purchase orders are not included in the table above. Our purchase orders represent authorizations to purchase rather than binding agreements. The contractual commitment amounts in the table above are associated with agreements that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms, including: fixed or minimum services to be used; fixed, minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. Obligations under contracts that we can cancel without a significant penalty are not included in the table above. During fiscal 2019 and in future fiscal years, we have made and expect to continue to make additional investments in our infrastructure to scale our operations, increase productivity and enhance our security measures. We plan to upgrade or replace various internal systems to scale with our overall growth. Additionally, we expect capital expenditures to be higher in absolute dollars and remain consistent as a percentage of total revenues in future periods as a result of continued office build-outs, other leasehold improvements and data center investments. Utilization of tax carryforwards and credits As we continue our trend in profitability, we expect to utilize our net operating loss carryforward and various tax credits to reduce our cash tax payments. For example, our Federal net operating loss carryforwards are $2.1 billion as of January 31, 2019 as compared to $2.7 billion as of January 31, 2018. We expect our cash tax payments for the next 12 months, primarily from profitable jurisdictions outside of the U.S, to be consistent with those paid in prior years. New Accounting Pronouncements See Note 1 Summary of Business and Significant Accounting Policies to the consolidated financial statements for our discussion about new accounting pronouncements adopted and those pending. Environmental, Social and Governance We believe the business of business is improving the state of the world for all of our stakeholders, including our stockholders, customers, partners, employees, community, environment and society. We are committed to creating a sustainable, low-carbon future by delivering a carbon neutral cloud, operating as a net-zero greenhouse gas emissions company and by working to achieve our goal of 100 percent renewable energy for our global operations by fiscal 2022. We also believe consistent, comparable and reliable disclosures around climate-related risks and opportunities are important. To this end, we are working to align with the recommendations of the Financial Stability Board's (\"FSB\") Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (\"TCFD\") and of the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (\"SASB\"). In addition, we have spearheaded human capital management initiatives to drive equality in four key areas: equal rights, equal pay, equal education and equal opportunity. We also pioneered and have inspired other companies to adopt our 1-1-1 integrated philanthropy model, which leverages one percent of a companys equity, employee time and product to help improve communities around the world. We publish an annual stakeholder impact report on our website detailing our overall strategy relating to environmental, social and governance (ESG) programs as well as our efforts in these areas. Below are some of the key highlights of our ongoing ESG efforts: ##TABLE_START  In fiscal 2019, we remained a net-zero greenhouse gas emissions company, continued delivering a carbon neutral cloud for all customers and procured electricity from renewable energy resources equivalent to 55 percent of what we used globally. To support our commitment to renewable energy, we have signed four virtual power purchase agreements (VPPAs). This includes two agreements which were signed in fiscal 2019: our largest VPPA to date with a new wind energy project in Illinois that is expected to be operational in fiscal year 2020, and our first-ever renewable energy aggregation deal with a new solar energy project in North Carolina which is expected to be operational in fiscal 2021. In addition, the three buildings at our corporate headquarters in San Francisco sourced 100 percent renewable energy in fiscal 2019. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  We are active in and support organizations that move the United States and the world toward a more sustainable, low-carbon future. In fiscal 2019, we partnered with Mission 2020 to establish the Step Up Declaration, a new alliance committed to harnessing the power of emerging technologies to help reduce emissions across all economic sectors. As part of the declaration we committed to expand our carbon offset program to include business travel and employee commuting, and to continue to expand our sustainable real estate commitments. We also committed to setting our own science-based targets, including working with our suppliers to set their own climate targets. In addition, we were a founding member of the Business Renewables Center, signed the Corporate Renewable Energy Buyers Principles, helped to launch the Corporate Colocation and Cloud Buyers Principles, disclosed our annual carbon emissions to the Carbon Disclosure Project and signed on to initiatives such as We Mean Business and the American Business Act on Climate. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  As part of our ongoing work to promote equality, we review the salaries and bonuses of our global workforce on an annual basis to ensure everyone is paid equally for equal work and close any unexplained gaps. To date, we have spent $8.7 million to ensure equal pay for equal work. We also review differences in pay for not only gender, but also race and ethnicity in the United States. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Our employees are engaged in and actively support our commitment to equality and enhancing our Ohana culture. We support ten employee-led and founded Ohana Groups, which provide a community for underrepresented groups and their allies, offer professional development and mentoring opportunities, and empower employees to be responsive equality leaders in their community. This has resulted in nearly half of our employees engaging in Ohana Groups in fiscal 2019. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Together with the Salesforce Foundation, a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization, and Salesforce.org, a nonprofit social enterprise, which are not included in our consolidated financial statements, to date we have given approximately $260 million to charitable organizations, logged more than 3.8 million employee volunteer hours around the world and provided more than 40,000 nonprofit and higher education organizations with the use of our service offerings for free or at a discount. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  We have significantly increased the diversity of our Board over the past five years, including with respect to gender and race. ##TABLE_ENDWe leverage a number of communications channels and strategic content to better serve and engage our many stakeholders. Our sustainability website, www.salesforce.com/company/sustainability, provides information regarding our environmental and other sustainability efforts, including our annual impact reports and our environmental policy. At our equality portal, www.salesforce.com/company/equality, our stakeholders can gain insights on our approach to equality, see our company profile by gender, and review our most recent Employer Information Report, which provides a snapshot in time of our U.S. demographics based on categories prescribed by the federal government.

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK ##TABLE_END Foreign Currency Exchange Risk We primarily conduct our business in the following locations: the United States, Europe, Canada, Asia Pacific and Japan. The expanding global scope of our business exposes us to risk of fluctuations in foreign currency markets. This exposure is the result of selling in multiple currencies, growth in our international investments, including data center expansion, additional headcount in foreign countries and operating in countries where the functional currency is the local currency. Specifically, our results of operations and cash flows are subject to fluctuations in the following currencies: the Euro, British Pound Sterling, Canadian Dollar, Australian Dollar and Japanese Yen against the United States Dollar (USD). These exposures may change over time as business practices evolve and economic conditions change. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates could have an adverse impact on our financial results and cash flows. Our European revenue, operating expenses and significant balance sheet accounts denominated in currencies other than the USD primarily flow through our United Kingdom (\"UK\") subsidiary, which has a functional currency of the British Pound. This results in a two-step currency exchange process wherein the currencies in Europe other than the British Pound are first converted into the British Pound and then British Pounds are translated into USD for our Consolidated Financial Statements. As an example, costs incurred in France are translated from the Euro to the British Pound and then into the USD. Our statements of operations and balance sheet accounts are also impacted by the re-measurement of non-functional currency transactions such as USD denominated intercompany loans, cash accounts held by our overseas subsidiaries, accounts receivable denominated in foreign currencies and unearned revenue and accounts payable denominated in foreign currencies. In fiscal 2020, we will begin transitioning away from this UK-centralized European structure and enable some of our local subsidiaries within Europe to invoice customers directly and thereby recognize revenues, operating expenses and corresponding balance sheet accounts in local currencies. With the change to local invoicing in some markets, we expect better alignment between our revenue and expenses in the local currency thereby reducing our foreign currency exposure. The U.K. held a referendum in June 2016 in which a majority of voters approved an exit from the European Union (\"EU\") (Brexit). In March 2017, the UK government gave formal notice of its intention to leave the EU and started the process of negotiating the future terms of the UK's relationship with the EU. Brexit could adversely affect UK, regional (including European) and worldwide economic and market conditions and could contribute to instability in global financial and foreign exchange markets, including volatility in the value of the British Pound and Euro. We have evaluated and started to implement initiatives, such as the commitment to invest resources in Dublin, Ireland, that could partially mitigate the impact Brexit could have on our operations. In fiscal 2019, 2018 and 2017, total revenues generated in Europe were approximately 19 percent , 18 percent and 16 percent of total revenues, respectively, of which substantially all were recorded in our UK subsidiary. Revenues in Europe increased on a total dollar basis by $35 million and $104 million in fiscal 2019 compared to fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017, respectively, as a result of the strengthening British Pound Sterling. We recognize that there are still significant uncertainties surrounding the ultimate resolution of Brexit negotiations, and we will continue to monitor any changes that may arise and assess their potential impact on our business. Foreign Currency Transaction Risk Our foreign currency exposures typically arise from selling annual and multi-year subscriptions in multiple currencies, customer accounts receivable, intercompany transfer pricing arrangements and other intercompany transactions. Our foreign currency management objective is to minimize the effect of fluctuations in foreign exchange rates on selected assets or liabilities without exposing us to additional risk associated with transactions that could be regarded as speculative. We pursue our objective by utilizing foreign currency forward contracts to offset foreign exchange risk. Our foreign currency forward contracts are generally short-term in duration. We neither use these foreign currency forward contracts for trading purposes nor do we currently designate these forward contracts as hedging instruments pursuant to Accounting Standards Codification 815 (ASC 815), Derivatives and Hedging. Accordingly, we record the fair values of these contracts as of the end of our reporting period to our consolidated balance sheets with changes in fair values recorded to our consolidated statements of operations. Given the short duration of the forward contracts, the amount recorded is not significant. Our ultimate realized gain or loss with respect to foreign currency exposures will generally depend on the size and type of cross-currency transactions that we enter into, the currency exchange rates associated with these exposures and changes in those rates, the net realized gain or loss on our foreign currency forward contracts and other factors. Foreign Currency Translation Risk Fluctuations in foreign currencies impact the amount of total assets, liabilities, revenues, operating expenses and cash flows that we report for our foreign subsidiaries upon the translation of these amounts into USD. Although the USD fluctuated against certain international currencies over the past several months, the amounts of revenue and unearned revenue that we reported in USD for foreign subsidiaries that transact in international currencies were similar to what we would have reported during the three months using a constant currency rate. Interest Rate Sensitivity We had cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaling $4.3 billion at January 31, 2019 . This amount was invested primarily in money market funds, time deposits, corporate notes and bonds, government securities and other debt securities with credit ratings of at least BBB or better. The cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities are held for general corporate purposes, including acquisitions of, or investments in, complementary businesses, services or technologies, working capital and capital expenditures. Our investments are made for capital preservation purposes. We do not enter into investments for trading or speculative purposes. Our cash equivalents and our portfolio of marketable securities are subject to market risk due to changes in interest rates. Fixed rate securities may have their market value adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates, while floating rate securities may produce less income than expected if interest rates fall. Due in part to these factors, our future investment income may fall short of expectation due to changes in interest rates or we may suffer losses in principal if we are forced to sell securities that decline in market value due to changes in interest rates. However, because we classify our debt securities as available for sale, no gains or losses are recognized due to changes in interest rates unless such securities are sold prior to maturity or declines in fair value are determined to be other-than-temporary. An immediate increase or decrease in interest rates of 100-basis points at January 31, 2019 could result in a $21 million market value reduction or increase of the same amount. This estimate is based on a sensitivity model that measures market value changes when changes in interest rates occur. Fluctuations in the value of our investment securities caused by a change in interest rates (gains or losses on the carrying value) are recorded in other comprehensive income, and are realized only if we sell the underlying securities. At January 31, 2018 , we had cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaling $4.5 billion . The fixed-income portfolio was also subject to interest rate risk. Changes in interest rates of 100-basis points would have resulted in market value changes of $34 million . Market Risk and Market Interest Risk We deposit our cash with multiple financial institutions. In addition, we maintain debt obligations that are subject to market interest risk, as follows (in millions): ##TABLE_START Instrument  Maturity date  Principal Outstanding as of January 31, 2019  Interest Terms  Effective interest rate for fiscal 2019 2021 Term Loan  May 2021  $  Floating  3.05 % 2023 Senior Notes  April 2023  1,000  Fixed  3.26 % 2028 Senior Notes  April 2028  1,500  Fixed  3.70 % Loan assumed on 50 Fremont  June 2023   Fixed  3.75 % Revolving credit facility  April 2023   Floating  N/A ##TABLE_ENDThe 2021 Term Loan bears interest, at our option, at either a base rate plus a spread of 0.00% to 0.25% or an adjusted LIBOR rate plus a spread of 0.625% to 1.25%, in each case, with such spread being determined based on our credit rating. By entering into the 2021 Term Loan, we have assumed risks associated with variable interest rates based upon a variable base rate or LIBOR. Changes in the overall level of interest rates affect the interest expense that we recognize in our statements of operations. The 2021 Term Loan was signed in April 2018 and funds were received in May 2018. The borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility bear interest, at our option, at a base rate plus a spread of 0.00% to 0.375% or an adjusted LIBOR rate plus a spread of 0.75% to 1.375%, in each case with such spread being determined based on our credit rating. Regardless of what amounts, if any, are outstanding under the revolving credit facility, we are also obligated to pay an ongoing commitment fee on undrawn amounts at a rate of 0.05% to 0.175%, with such rate being based on our public debt rating, payable in arrears quarterly. As of January 31, 2019 , there was no outstanding borrowing amount under the Revolving Credit Facility. The bank counterparties to our derivative contracts potentially expose us to credit-related losses in the event of their nonperformance. To mitigate that risk, we only contract with counterparties who meet the minimum requirements under our counterparty risk assessment process. We monitor ratings, credit spreads and potential downgrades on at least a quarterly basis. Based on our on-going assessment of counterparty risk, we adjust our exposure to various counterparties. We generally enter into master netting arrangements, which reduce credit risk by permitting net settlement of transactions with the same counterparty. However, we do not have any master netting arrangements in place with collateral features. We have an investment portfolio that includes strategic investments in public and privately held companies, which range from early-stage companies to more mature companies with established revenue streams and business models. As of January 31, 2019 , our portfolio, which consists of investments in over 235 privately held companies and six public companies, is primarily comprised of independent software vendors and system integrators. Our investments in these companies range from $0.1 million to approximately $105 million , with 21 investments individually equal to or in excess of approximately $10 million as of January 31, 2019 . We invest in early-to-late stage enterprise cloud companies for strategic reasons and to support key business initiatives to grow our ecosystem of partners and accelerate the adoption of cloud technologies. We invest in both domestic and international companies and currently hold investments in all of our regions: the Americas, Europe, and Asia Pacific. We plan to continue to invest in these types of strategic investments, including in companies representing targeted geographies and targeted business and technological initiatives, as opportunities arise that we find attractive. The primary purpose of our investments is to create an ecosystem of enterprise cloud companies, accelerate the growth of technology startups and system integrators and create the next generation of AI, mobile applications and connected products. Therefore, we continually evaluate our investments in privately held and publicly traded companies. In certain cases, our ability to sell these investments may be impacted by contractual obligations to hold the securities for a set period of time after a public offering. Currently, three of our six publicly held investments are subject to such a contractual obligation, which expire in the first quarter of fiscal 2020. Upon adoption of ASU 2016-01 in the first quarter of fiscal 2019, we are now required to record all fair value adjustments of our publicly traded and privately held equity investments through the statement of operations. As such we anticipate additional volatility to our statements of operations in future periods, due to changes in market prices of our investments in publicly held equity investments and the valuation and timing of observable price changes and impairments of our investments in privately held securities. These changes could be material based on market conditions and events. While historically our investment portfolio has had a positive impact on our financial results, that may not be true for future periods, particularly in periods of significant market fluctuations that affect our strategic investments portfolio. In addition, the financial success of our investment in any company is typically dependent on a liquidity event, such as a public offering, acquisition or other favorable market event reflecting appreciation to the cost of our initial investment. All of our investments, particularly those in privately held companies, are therefore subject to a risk of partial or total loss of investment capital. ##TABLE_START ", "8": " ITEM 8.

Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Companys internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB.

Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting A companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. ##TABLE_START /s/ Ernst  Young LLP ##TABLE_ENDRedwood City, California March 8, 2019  salesforce.com, inc.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements 1. Summary of Business and Significant Accounting Policies Description of Business Salesforce.com, inc. (the \"Company\") is a leading provider of enterprise software, delivered through the cloud, with a focus on customer relationship management, or CRM. The Company introduced its first CRM solution in 2000, and has since expanded its service offerings into new areas and industries with new editions, features and platform capabilities. The Company's core mission is to empower its customers to connect with their customers in entirely new ways through cloud, mobile, social, Internet of Things (IoT) and artificial intelligence (\"AI\") technologies. The Company's Customer Success Platform is a comprehensive portfolio of service offerings providing sales force automation, customer service and support, marketing automation, digital commerce, integration solutions, community management, industry-specific solutions, analytics, application development, IoT integration, collaborative productivity tools, an enterprise cloud marketplace which the Company refers to as the AppExchange, and its professional services. Fiscal Year The Companys fiscal year ends on January 31. References to fiscal 2019 , for example, refer to the fiscal year ending January 31, 2019 . Use of Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions in the Companys consolidated financial statements and notes thereto. Significant estimates and assumptions made by management include the determination of: ##TABLE_START  the standalone selling price (SSP) of performance obligations for contracts with multiple performance obligations; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  the estimate of variable consideration as part of the adoption of Accounting Standards Update No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) (ASU 2014-09); ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed for business combinations; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  the recognition, measurement and valuation of current and deferred income taxes; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  the average period of benefit associated with costs capitalized to obtain revenue contracts; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  the fair value of certain stock awards issued; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  the useful lives of intangible assets; and ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  the valuation of privately-held strategic investments. ##TABLE_END Actual results could differ materially from those estimates. The Company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable, the result of which forms the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities. Principles of Consolidation The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. Segments The Company operates as one operating segment. Operating segments are defined as components of an enterprise for which separate financial information is evaluated regularly by the chief operating decision makers in deciding how to allocate resources and assess performance. Over the past few years, the Company has completed a number of acquisitions. These acquisitions have allowed the Company to expand its offerings, presence and reach in various market segments of the enterprise cloud computing market. While the Company has offerings in multiple enterprise cloud computing market segments, including as a result of the Company's acquisitions, the Companys business operates in one operating segment because the Company's offerings operate on its single Customer Success Platform and most of the Company's products are deployed in an identical way, and the Companys chief operating decision makers evaluate the Companys financial information and resources and assess the performance of these resources on a consolidated basis. Since the Company operates in one operating segment, all required financial segment information can be found in the consolidated financial statements. In August 2018, the Company moved to a co-chief executive officer model with the promotion of the Company's vice chairman and chief operating officer. The Company determined that both co-chief executive officers also serve as chief operating decision makers for the purposes of segment reporting. Despite the change in the chief operating decision maker, the Company determined no change to segment reporting was necessary as there was no change in the components of the Company for which separate financial information is regularly evaluated. Concentrations of Credit Risk and Significant Customers The Companys financial instruments that are exposed to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities and accounts receivable. Collateral is not required for accounts receivable. The Company maintains an allowance for its doubtful accounts receivable. This allowance is based upon historical loss patterns, the number of days that billings are past due and an evaluation of the potential risk of loss associated with delinquent accounts. Receivables are written-off and charged against the recorded allowance when the Company has exhausted collection efforts without success. No single customer accounted for more than five percent of accounts receivable at January 31, 2019 and January 31, 2018 . No single customer accounted for five percent or more of total revenue during fiscal 2019 , 2018 and 2017. As of January 31, 2019 and January 31, 2018 , assets located outside the Americas were 14 percent and 17 percent of total assets, respectively. As of January 31, 2019 and January 31, 2018 , assets located in the United States were 84 percent and 81 percent of total assets, respectively. Revenue Recognition Adoption of Topic 606 Effective at the start of fiscal 2019, the Company adopted the provisions and expanded disclosure requirements described in ASU 2014-09 also referred to as Topic 606. The Company adopted the standard using the full retrospective method. Accordingly, the results for the prior comparable periods were adjusted to conform to the current period measurement and recognition of results. The impact of Topic 606 on reported revenue results was not material. Topic 606, however, modified the Companys revenue recognition policy in the following ways: ##TABLE_START  Removal of the limitation on contingent revenue, which can result in the subscription and support revenue for certain multi-year customer contracts being recognized earlier in the duration of the contract term; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  More allocation of subscription and support revenues across the Companys cloud service offerings and to professional services revenue; and ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Inclusion of an estimate of variable consideration, such as overage fees, in the total transaction price, which results in the estimated fees being recognized ratably over the contract term, further resulting in the recognition of subscription and support revenues before the actual variable consideration occurs. ##TABLE_END The Company used the following transitional practical expedients in the adoption of Topic 606: ##TABLE_START  The Company has not disclosed the remaining performance obligation (formerly, remaining transaction price) for all of the reporting periods prior to the first quarter of fiscal 2019; and ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Contracts modified before fiscal 2017 were reflected using the retrospective method. ##TABLE_END Additionally, as part of its business strategy, the Company periodically makes acquisitions of complementary businesses, services and technology. These acquired businesses may have customer arrangements that include the delivery of an on-premise software element combined with a software-as-a-service element. This was the case with the Company's acquisition of MuleSoft, Inc. (MuleSoft) in May 2018. The Company has to apply significant judgment to determine the appropriate revenue recognition policy for such products and services since Topic 606 eliminated the provision that service revenue accounting was appropriate when the relative selling price of one or more deliverables in a multiple element solution arrangement could not be determined. Revenue Recognition Policy The Company derives its revenues from two sources: (1) subscription revenues, which are comprised of subscription fees from customers accessing the Companys enterprise cloud computing services (collectively, \"Cloud Services\"), software licenses, and from customers paying for additional support beyond the standard support that is included in the basic subscription fees; and (2) related professional services such as process mapping, project management and implementation services. Other revenue consists primarily of training fees. With the adoption of Topic 606, revenue is recognized upon transfer of control of promised products and services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration the Company expects to receive in exchange for those products or services. If the consideration promised in a contract includes a variable amount, for example, overage fees, contingent fees or service level penalties, the Company includes an estimate of the amount it expects to receive for the total transaction price if it is probable that a significant reversal of cumulative revenue recognized will not occur. The Company determines the amount of revenue to be recognized through application of the following steps:  Identification of the contract, or contracts with a customer;  Identification of the performance obligations in the contract;  Determination of the transaction price;  Allocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and  Recognition of revenue when or as the Company satisfies the performance obligations. The Companys subscription service arrangements are non-cancelable and do not contain refund-type provisions. Subscription and Support Revenues Subscription and support revenues are comprised of fees that provide customers with access to Cloud Services, software licenses and related support and updates during the term of the arrangement. Cloud Services allow customers to use the Company's multi-tenant software without taking possession of the software. Revenue is generally recognized ratably over the contract term. Since the May 2018 acquisition of MuleSoft, subscription and support revenues also includes software licenses. These licenses for on-premises software provide the customer with a right to use the software as it exists when made available. Customers purchase these licenses through a subscription. Revenues from distinct licenses are generally recognized upfront when the software is made available to the customer. In cases where the Company allocates revenue to software updates and support, primarily because the updates are provided at no additional charge, such revenue is recognized as the updates are provided, which is generally ratably over the contract term. The Company typically invoices its customers annually. Typical payment terms provide that customers pay within 30 days of invoice. Amounts that have been invoiced are recorded in accounts receivable and in unearned revenue or revenue, depending on whether transfer of control to customers has occurred. Professional Services and Other Revenues The Companys professional services contracts are either on a time and materials, fixed fee or subscription basis. These revenues are recognized as the services are rendered for time and materials contracts, on a proportional performance basis for fixed price contracts and ratably over the contract term for subscription professional services contracts. Training revenues are recognized as the services are performed. Significant Judgments - Contracts with Multiple Performance Obligations The Company enters into contracts with its customers that may include promises to transfer multiple Cloud Services, software licenses, premium support and professional services. A performance obligation is a promise in a contract with a customer to transfer products or services that are distinct. Determining whether products and services are distinct performance obligations that should be accounted for separately or combined as one unit of accounting may require significant judgment. Cloud Services and software licenses are distinct as such offerings are often sold separately. In determining whether professional services are distinct, the Company considers the following factors for each professional services agreement: availability of the services from other vendors, the nature of the professional services, the timing of when the professional services contract was signed in comparison to the subscription start date and the contractual dependence of the service on the customers satisfaction with the professional services work. To date, the Company has concluded that all of the professional services included in contracts with multiple performance obligations are distinct. The Company allocates the transaction price to each performance obligation on a relative standalone selling price (\"SSP\") basis. The SSP is the price at which the Company would sell a promised product or service separately to a customer. Judgment is required to determine the SSP for each distinct performance obligation. The Company determines SSP by considering its overall pricing objectives and market conditions. Significant pricing practices taken into consideration include the Companys discounting practices, the size and volume of the Companys transactions, the customer demographic, the geographic area where services are sold, price lists, its go-to-market strategy, historical sales and contract prices. As the Companys go-to-market strategies evolve, the Company may modify its pricing practices in the future, which could result in changes to SSP. In certain cases, the Company is able to establish SSP based on observable prices of products or services sold separately in comparable circumstances to similar customers. The Company uses a single amount to estimate SSP when it has observable prices. If SSP is not directly observable, for example when pricing is highly variable, the Company uses a range of SSP. The Company determines the SSP range using information that may include market conditions or other observable inputs. The Company typically has more than one SSP for individual products and services due to the stratification of those products and services by customer size and geography. Costs Capitalized to Obtain Revenue Contracts As part of its adoption of ASU 2014-09, the Company capitalizes incremental costs of obtaining a non-cancelable subscription and support revenue contract. The provisions of ASU 2014-09 are significantly different than the Company's previous accounting for deferred commissions. The new guidance results in the capitalization of significantly more costs and longer amortization lives. Under the prior accounting guidance, the Company only capitalized sales commissions that had a direct and incremental relationship to a specific new revenue contract and amortized the capitalized amounts over the initial contract period, which was typically 12 to 36 months. Under the new accounting, the capitalized amounts consist primarily of sales commissions paid to the Companys direct sales force. Capitalized amounts also include (1) amounts paid to employees other than the direct sales force who earn incentive payouts under annual compensation plans that are tied to the value of contracts acquired, (2) commissions paid to employees upon renewals of subscription and support contracts, (3) the associated payroll taxes and fringe benefit costs associated with the payments to the Companys employees, and to a lesser extent (4) success fees paid to partners in emerging markets where the Company has a limited presence. Costs capitalized related to new revenue contracts are amortized on a straight-line basis over four years , which, although longer than the typical initial contract period, reflects the average period of benefit, including expected contract renewals. In arriving at this average period of benefit, the Company evaluated both qualitative and quantitative factors which included the estimated life cycles of its offerings and its customer attrition. Additionally, the Company amortizes capitalized costs for renewals and success fees paid to partners over two years . The capitalized amounts are recoverable through future revenue streams under all non-cancelable customer contracts. The Company periodically evaluates whether there have been any changes in its business, the market conditions in which it operates or other events which would indicate that its amortization period should be changed or if there are potential indicators of impairment. Amortization of capitalized costs to obtain revenue contracts is included in marketing and sales expense in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations. During fiscal 2019 , the Company capitalized $1.0 billion of costs to obtain revenue contracts and amortized $0.7 billion to marketing and sales expense. During the same period a year ago, the Company capitalized $1.2 billion of costs to obtain revenue contracts and amortized $0.6 billion to marketing and sales expense. Costs capitalized to obtain a revenue contract, net on the Company's consolidated balance sheets totaled $2.0 billion at January 31, 2019 and $1.8 billion at January 31, 2018 . There were no impairments of costs to obtain revenue contracts in fiscal 2019, 2018 and 2017. Cash and Cash Equivalents The Company considers all highly liquid investments purchased with an original maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents. Cash and cash equivalents are stated at fair value. Marketable Securities The Company considers all of its marketable debt securities as available for use in current operations, including those with maturity dates beyond one year, and therefore classifies these securities within current assets on the consolidated balance sheets. Securities are classified as available for sale and are carried at fair value, with the change in unrealized gains and losses, net of tax, reported as a separate component on the consolidated statements of comprehensive income until realized. Fair value is determined based on quoted market rates when observable or utilizing data points that are observable, such as quoted prices, interest rates and yield curves. Declines in fair value judged to be other-than-temporary on securities available for sale are included as a reduction to investment income. To determine whether a decline in value is other-than-temporary, the Company evaluates, among other factors: the duration and extent to which the fair value has been less than the carrying value and its intent and ability to retain the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in fair value. For the purposes of computing realized and unrealized gains and losses, the cost of securities sold is based on the specific-identification method. Interest on securities classified as available for sale is included as a component of investment income. Strategic Investments The Company holds strategic investments in publicly held equity securities and privately held debt and equity securities in which the Company does not have a controlling interest or significant influence. Publicly held equity securities are measured using quoted prices in their respective active markets with changes recorded through gains (losses) on strategic investments, net on the consolidated statement of operations. Privately held equity securities without a readily determinable fair value are recorded at cost and adjusted for impairments and observable price changes with a same or similar security from the same issuer and are recorded through gains (losses) on strategic investments, net on the consolidated statement of operations. Privately held debt securities are recorded at fair value with changes in fair value recorded through accumulated other comprehensive income on the consolidated balance sheet. If, based on the terms of these publicly traded and privately held securities, the Company determines that the Company exercises significant influence on the entity to which these securities relate, the Company will apply the equity method of accounting for such investments. Privately held debt and equity securities are valued using significant unobservable inputs or data in an inactive market and the valuation requires the Company's judgment due to the absence of market prices and inherent lack of liquidity. The carrying value is not adjusted for the Company's privately held equity securities if there are no observable price changes in a same or similar security from the same issuer or if there are no identified events or changes in circumstances that may indicate impairment, as discussed below. In determining the estimated fair value of its strategic investments in privately held companies, the Company utilizes the most recent data available to the Company. Valuations of privately held companies are inherently complex due to the lack of readily available market data. In addition, the determination of whether an orderly transaction is for a same or similar investment requires significant management judgment including the nature of rights and obligations of the investments, the extent to which differences in those rights and obligations would affect the fair values of those investments, and the impact of any differences based on the stage of operational development of the investee. The Company assesses its privately held debt and equity securities strategic investment portfolio at least quarterly for impairment. The Companys impairment analysis encompasses an assessment of the severity and duration of the impairment and qualitative and quantitative analysis of other key factors including the investees financial metrics, the investees products and technologies meeting or exceeding predefined milestones, market acceptance of the product or technology, other competitive products or technology in the market, general market conditions, management and governance structure of the investee, the investees liquidity, debt ratios and the rate at which the investee is using its cash. If the investment is considered to be impaired, the Company recognizes an impairment through the consolidated statement of operations and establishes a new carrying value for the investment. Prior to fiscal 2019, investments in publicly held equity securities were classified as available-for-sale and measured and recorded at fair value with unrealized changes in fair value recorded through other comprehensive income. Prior to fiscal 2019, investments in privately held equity securities in which the Company did not have a controlling interest or significant influence were accounted for using the cost method of accounting, measured at cost less other-than-temporary impairment. Derivative Financial Instruments The Company enters into foreign currency derivative contracts with financial institutions to reduce foreign exchange risk. The Company uses forward currency derivative contracts to minimize the Companys exposure to balances primarily denominated in the Euro, British Pound Sterling, Japanese Yen, Canadian Dollar and Australian Dollar. The Companys foreign currency derivative contracts, which are not designated as hedging instruments, are used to reduce the exchange rate risk associated primarily with intercompany receivables and payables. The Companys derivative financial instruments program is not designated for trading or speculative purposes. As of January 31, 2019 and January 31, 2018 , the outstanding foreign currency derivative contracts were recorded at fair value on the consolidated balance sheets. Foreign currency derivative contracts are marked-to-market at the end of each reporting period with gains and losses recognized as other expense to offset the gains or losses resulting from the settlement or remeasurement of the underlying foreign currency denominated receivables and payables. While the contract or notional amount is often used to express the volume of foreign currency derivative contracts, the amounts potentially subject to credit risk are generally limited to the amounts, if any, by which the counterparties obligations under the agreements exceed the obligations of the Company to the counterparties. Fair Value Measurement The Company measures its cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities and foreign currency derivative contracts at fair value. In addition, the Company measures its strategic investments, including its publicly held equity securities, privately held debt securities and privately held equity securities for which there has been an observable price change in a same or similar security, at fair value. The additional disclosures regarding the Companys fair value measurements are included in Note 5 Fair Value Measurement. Property and Equipment Property and equipment are stated at cost. Depreciation is calculated on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of those assets as follows: ##TABLE_START Computers, equipment and software 3 to 9 years Furniture and fixtures 5 years Leasehold improvements Shorter of the estimated lease term or 10 years Building and structural components Average weighted useful life of 32 years Building - leased facility 27 years Building improvements 10 years ##TABLE_ENDWhen assets are retired or otherwise disposed of, the cost and accumulated depreciation and amortization are removed from their respective accounts and any loss on such retirement is reflected in operating expenses. Capitalized Software Costs The Company capitalizes costs related to its enterprise cloud computing services and certain projects for internal use incurred during the application development stage. Costs related to preliminary project activities and post implementation activities are expensed as incurred. Internal-use software is amortized on a straight-line basis over its estimated useful life, which is generally three to five years. Management evaluates the useful lives of these assets on an annual basis and tests for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances occur that could impact the recoverability of these assets. Intangible Assets Acquired through Business Combinations Intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives. Each period, the Company evaluates the estimated remaining useful life of its intangible assets and whether events or changes in circumstances warrant a revision to the remaining period of amortization. Management tests for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances occur that could impact the recoverability of these assets. Impairment Assessment The Company evaluates intangible assets and long-lived assets for possible impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable. This includes but is not limited to significant adverse changes in business climate, market conditions, or other events that indicate an asset's carrying amount may not be recoverable. Recoverability of these assets is measured by comparing the carrying amount of each asset to the future undiscounted cash flows the asset is expected to generate. If the undiscounted cash flows used in the test for recoverability are less than the carrying amount of these assets, the carrying amount of such assets is reduced to fair value. The Company evaluates and tests the recoverability of its goodwill for impairment at least annually during its fourth quarter of each fiscal year or more often if and when circumstances indicate that goodwill may not be recoverable. There were no material impairments of capitalized software, intangible assets, long-lived assets or goodwill during fiscal 2019 , 2018 and 2017. Business Combinations The Company uses its best estimates and assumptions to assign fair value to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date. The Companys estimates are inherently uncertain and subject to refinement. During the measurement period, which may be up to one year from the acquisition date, the Company may record adjustments to the fair value of these tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed, with the corresponding offset to goodwill. In addition, uncertain tax positions and tax-related valuation allowances are initially recorded in connection with a business combination as of the acquisition date. The Company continues to collect information and reevaluates these estimates and assumptions quarterly and records any adjustments to the Companys preliminary estimates to goodwill provided that the Company is within the measurement period. Upon the conclusion of the measurement period or final determination of the fair value of assets acquired or liabilities assumed, whichever comes first, any subsequent adjustments are recorded to the Companys consolidated statement of operations. In the event the Company acquires an entity with which the Company has a preexisting relationship, the Company will recognize a gain or loss to settle that relationship as of the acquisition date, which is recorded in net gains (losses) on strategic investments within the consolidated statements of operations. In the event that the Company acquires an entity in which the Company previously held a strategic investment, the difference between the fair value of the shares as of the date of the acquisition and the carrying value of the strategic investment is recorded as a gain or loss and recorded within net gains (losses) on strategic investments in the consolidated statement of operations. Leases and Asset Retirement Obligations The Company categorizes leases at their inception as either operating or capital leases. In certain lease agreements, the Company may receive rent holidays and other incentives. The Company recognizes lease costs on a straight-line basis once control of the space is achieved, without regard to deferred payment terms such as rent holidays that defer the commencement date of required payments. Additionally, incentives received are treated as a reduction of costs over the term of the agreement. The Company establishes assets and liabilities for the present value of estimated future costs to retire long-lived assets at the termination or expiration of a lease. Such assets are depreciated over the lease period to operating expense. In the event the Company is the deemed owner for accounting purposes during construction, the Company records assets and liabilities for the estimated construction costs incurred under build-to-suit lease arrangements to the extent it is involved in the construction of structural improvements or takes construction risk prior to commencement of a lease. The Company additionally has entered into subleases for unoccupied leased office space. To the extent there are losses associated with the sublease, they are recognized in the period the sublease is executed. Any sublease payments received in excess of the straight-line rent payments for the sublease are recorded as an offset to rent expense and recognized over the sublease life. Stock-Based Expense The Company recognizes stock-based expenses related to stock options and restricted stock awards on a straight-line basis, net of estimated forfeitures, over the requisite service period of the awards, which is generally the vesting term of four years . The Company recognizes stock-based expenses related to shares issued pursuant to its Amended and Restated 2004 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (ESPP or 2004 Employee Stock Purchase Plan) on a straight-line basis over the offering period, which is 12 months . The ESPP allows employees to purchase shares of the Company's common stock at a 15 percent discount and also allows employees to reduce their percentage election once during a six month purchase period (December 15 and June 15 of each fiscal year), but not increase that election until the next one-year offering period. The ESPP also includes a re-set provision for the purchase price if the stock price on the purchase date is less than the stock price on the offering date. Stock-based expenses related to performance share grants are measured based on grant date fair value and expensed on a straight-line basis, net of estimated forfeitures, over the service period of the awards, which is generally the vesting term of three years. The Company, at times, grants unvested restricted shares to employee stockholders of certain acquired companies in lieu of cash consideration. These awards are generally subject to continued post-acquisition employment. Therefore, the Company accounts for them as post-acquisition stock-based expense. The Company recognizes stock-based expense equal to the grant date fair value of the restricted stock awards on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period of the awards, which is generally four years . Advertising Expenses Advertising is expensed as incurred. Advertising expense was $482 million , $373 million and $350 million for fiscal 2019 , 2018 and 2017 , respectively. Income Taxes The Company uses the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on temporary differences between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax laws is recognized in the consolidated statements of operations in the period that includes the enactment date. The Companys tax positions are subject to income tax audits by multiple tax jurisdictions throughout the world. The Company recognizes the tax benefit of an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the position is sustainable upon examination by the taxing authority, solely based on its technical merits. The tax benefit recognized is measured as the largest amount of benefit which is greater than 50 percent likely to be realized upon settlement with the taxing authority. The Company recognizes interest accrued and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in the income tax provision. Valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amounts that are more likely than not expected to be realized based on the weighting of positive and negative evidence. Future realization of deferred tax assets ultimately depends on the existence of sufficient taxable income of the appropriate character (for example, ordinary income or capital gain) within the carryback or carryforward periods available under the applicable tax law. The Company regularly reviews the deferred tax assets for recoverability based on historical taxable income, projected future taxable income, the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences and tax planning strategies. The Companys judgments regarding future profitability may change due to many factors, including future market conditions and the ability to successfully execute its business plans. Should there be a change in the ability to recover deferred tax assets, the tax provision would increase or decrease in the period in which the assessment is changed. Foreign Currency Translation The functional currency of the Companys major foreign subsidiaries is generally the local currency. Adjustments resulting from translating foreign functional currency financial statements into U.S. dollars are recorded as a separate component on the consolidated statement of comprehensive income. Foreign currency transaction gains and losses are included in other income in the consolidated statement of operations for the period. All assets and liabilities denominated in a foreign currency are translated into U.S. dollars at the exchange rate on the balance sheet date. Revenues and expenses are translated at the average exchange rate during the period. Equity transactions are translated using historical exchange rates. Warranties and Indemnification The Companys enterprise cloud computing services are typically warranted to perform in a manner consistent with general industry standards that are reasonably applicable and materially in accordance with the Companys online help documentation under normal use and circumstances. The Companys arrangements generally include certain provisions for indemnifying customers against liabilities if its products or services infringe a third partys intellectual property rights. To date, the Company has not incurred any material costs as a result of such obligations and has not accrued any material liabilities related to such obligations in the accompanying consolidated financial statements. The Company has also agreed to indemnify its directors and executive officers for costs associated with any fees, expenses, judgments, fines and settlement amounts incurred by any of these persons in any action or proceeding to which any of those persons is, or is threatened to be, made a party by reason of the persons service as a director or officer, including any action by the Company, arising out of that persons services as the Companys director or officer or that persons services provided to any other company or enterprise at the Companys request. The Company maintains director and officer insurance coverage that would generally enable the Company to recover a portion of any future amounts paid. The Company may also be subject to indemnification obligations by law with respect to the actions of its employees under certain circumstances and in certain jurisdictions. New Accounting Pronouncements Adopted in Fiscal 2019 Topic 606 In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09, which in addition to replacing the existing revenue recognition guidance, provides guidance on the recognition of costs related to obtaining customer contracts. The adoption was material to the Companys reported operating results and balance sheet for fiscal 2018 and 2017, as it requires additional types of costs to be capitalized and amortized over a longer period. The Company also recorded the related income tax effects, which did not have a material impact due to the Company's valuation allowance. The adoption had no impact to the Companys operating cash flow. The adoption of ASU 2014-09 impacted the Company's previously reported results as follows (in millions, except per share data): ##TABLE_START  Fiscal Year Ended January 31, 2018  Fiscal Year Ended January 31, 2017  As reported  Change  As adjusted  As reported  Change  As adjusted Total revenues $ 10,480  $  $ 10,540  $ 8,392  $  $ 8,437 Marketing and sales 4,829  (158 )  4,671  3,918  (107 )  3,811 Benefit from (provision for) income taxes (75 )   (60 )   (11 )  Net income $  $  $  $  $  $ Diluted net income per share $ 0.17  $ 0.32  $ 0.49  $ 0.26  $ 0.20  $ 0.46 ##TABLE_ENDThe number of shares utilized to calculate the fiscal 2018 and 2017 diluted net income per share was 735 million and 700 million , respectively. The adoption of ASU 2014-09 impacted the Company's previously reported financial position as of January 31, 2018 as follows (in millions): ##TABLE_START  As reported  Change  As adjusted Accounts receivable, net $ 3,918  $  $ 3,921 Costs capitalized to obtain revenue contracts, net   Prepaid expenses and other current assets   Costs capitalized to obtain revenue contracts, noncurrent, net   1,105 Other assets, net  (12 )  Accrued compensation   1,001 Accrued expenses and other liabilities  (3 )  Unearned revenue 7,095  (100 )  6,995 Other noncurrent liabilities   Stockholders equity 9,389   10,376 ##TABLE_ENDASU 2016-01  In January 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-01, which requires entities to measure equity instruments at fair value and recognize any changes in fair value within the statement of operations. The Company adopted ASU 2016-01 in the first quarter of fiscal 2019 on a prospective basis for privately held equity securities and a modified retrospective basis for publicly held equity investments. Upon adoption of ASU 2016-01, the Company reclassified approximately $13 million of unrealized gains related to its publicly traded equity investments and approximately $6 million reflecting the tax impact, from accumulated other comprehensive loss on the balance sheet to retained earnings. For fiscal 2019 , the Company recorded net unrealized gains of $464 million , which excludes recognized gains on the sale of investments of $78 million , in the consolidated statement of operations, and the Company anticipates additional volatility to the Company's statements of operations in future periods, due to changes in market prices of the Company's investments in publicly held equity investments and the valuation and timing of observable price changes and impairments of its investments in privately held securities. ASU 2016-16 In October 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-16, which requires entities to recognize the income tax consequences of an intra-entity transfer of an asset when the transfer occurs. The Company adopted the standard in the first quarter of fiscal 2019 using the modified retrospective transition method and reclassified a cumulative-effect adjustment to reduce retained earnings as of the effective date of approximately $17 million . Accounting Pronouncements Pending Adoption ASU 2016-02 In February 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-02, \"Leases (Topic 842)\" (\"ASU 2016-02\"), which requires lessees to record most leases on their balance sheet but recognize the expenses on their statement of operations in a manner similar to current accounting guidance \"Leases (Topic 840)\". ASU 2016-02 states that a lessee would recognize a lease liability for the obligation to make lease payments and a right-to-use asset for the right to use the underlying asset for the lease term. ASU 2016-02 will be effective for fiscal 2020, including interim periods within that reporting period. Upon adoption of ASU 2016-02 the Company plans to elect the package of practical expedients and not reassess prior conclusions on whether contracts are or contain a lease, lease classification, and initial direct costs. In addition, the Company plans to adopt the lessee practical expedient to combine lease and non-lease components for all asset classes. The Company expects to make a policy election to not recognize right-of-use assets or lease liabilities for short term leases of all asset classes. The Company does not plan to elect the practical expedient to use hindsight when determining lease term. ASC 2016-02 will have a material impact on the Companys consolidated balance sheet. Leases currently designated as operating leases in Note 13, Commitments, will be reported on the consolidated balance sheet upon adoption at their net present value, which will increase total assets and liabilities. In addition, the financing obligation and building asset associated with the Company's leased facility at 350 Mission Street will be derecognized upon adoption of ASC 2016-02 and the lease will be accounted for as a finance type lease, which will result in the recognition of a right of use asset and a lease liability. ASU 2016-02 is not expected to have a material impact to the Companys consolidated statement of operations or net cash provided by operating activities. In addition, the Company does not expect any impact to the Companys debt covenants. In preparation for adoption of the standard, the Company is in the process of implementing key systems, processes and internal controls to enable the preparation of financial information. In July 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-11, Leases (Topic 842) Targeted Improvements\" (\"ASU 2018-11\"), which allows for the adoption of ASU 2016-02 to be applied at the beginning of the year of adoption, as opposed to at the beginning of the earliest year presented in the financial statements. The Company will adopt the transitional provisions allowed under ASU 2018-11 and as such, the consolidated balance sheets and statements of operations for prior periods will not be comparable in the year of adoption of ASU 2016-02. ASU 2016-13 In June 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-13 (ASU 2016-13) \"Financial Instruments-Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments,\" which requires the measurement and recognition of expected credit losses for financial assets held at amortized cost, which includes the Company's accounts receivables, certain financial instruments and contract assets. ASU 2016-13 replaces the existing incurred loss impairment model with an expected loss methodology, which will result in more timely recognition of credit losses. ASU 2016-13 is effective for annual reporting periods, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2019, and requires a cumulative effect adjustment to the balance sheet as of the beginning of the first reporting period in which the guidance is effective. The Company is evaluating the impact of the adoption of ASU 2016-13 on its consolidated financial statements in order to adopt the new standard in the first quarter of fiscal 2021. ASU 2018-15 In August 2018, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2018-15 (ASU 2018-15) \"IntangiblesGoodwill and Other Internal-Use Software (Subtopic 350-40) - Customers Accounting for Implementation Costs Incurred in a Cloud Computing Arrangement That Is a Service Contract,\" which aligns the accounting for implementation costs incurred in a hosting arrangement that is a service contract with the accounting for implementation costs incurred to develop or obtain internal-use software under ASC 350-40, in order to determine which costs to capitalize and recognize as an asset and which costs to expense. ASU 2018-15 is effective for annual reporting periods, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2019, and can be applied either prospectively to implementation costs incurred after the date of adoption or retrospectively to all arrangements. The Company does not expect the adoption of ASU 2018-15 to be material. Reclassifications Certain reclassifications to fiscal 2018 and 2017 balances were made to conform to the current period presentation in the consolidated balance sheets, consolidated statements of operations and consolidated statements of cash flows. These reclassifications did not affect total revenues, operating income or net income. 2. Revenues Disaggregation of Revenue Subscription and Support Revenue by the Company's core service offerings Subscription and support revenues consisted of the following (in millions ): ##TABLE_START  Fiscal Year Ended January 31,    Sales Cloud $ 4,040  $ 3,588  $ 3,076 Service Cloud 3,621  2,883  2,343 Salesforce Platform and Other 2,854  1,913  1,433 Marketing and Commerce Cloud 1,898  1,382   $ 12,413  $ 9,766  $ 7,799 ##TABLE_ENDTotal Revenue by Geographic Locations Revenues by geographical region consisted of the following (in millions ): ##TABLE_START  Fiscal Year Ended January 31,    Americas $ 9,445  $ 7,621  $ 6,259 Europe 2,553  1,916  1,383 Asia Pacific 1,284  1,003   $ 13,282  $ 10,540  $ 8,437 ##TABLE_ENDRevenues by geography are determined based on the region of the Company's contracting entity, which may be different than the region of the customer. Americas revenue attributed to the United States was approximately 96 percent during fiscal 2019, 2018 , and 2017, respectively. No other country represented more than ten percent of total revenue during fiscal 2019, 2018 and 2017. Contract Balances Contract Asset As described in Note 1, subscription and support revenue is generally recognized ratably over the contract term beginning on the commencement date of each contract. License revenue is recognized as the licenses are delivered. Under Topic 606, the timing and amount of revenue recognition may differ in certain situations from the revenue recognized under previous accounting guidance that limited subscription and support revenue to the customer invoice amount for the period of service (collectively billings). Under Topic 606, the Company records a contract asset when revenue recognized on a contract exceeds the billings and unearned revenue when the billings on a contract exceed the revenue recognized. The Company's standard billing terms are annual in advance. Contract assets were $215 million as of January 31, 2019 as compared to $81 million as of January 31, 2018 . Approximately $122 million of contract assets were acquired in connection with the May 2018 MuleSoft acquisition. Impairments of contract assets were immaterial in fiscal 2019, 2018 and 2017. Unearned Revenue The concept of unearned revenue under Topic 606 is substantially similar to deferred revenue under previous accounting guidance, except for the removal of the limitation on contingent revenue. The unearned revenue balance does not represent the total contract value of annual or multi-year, non-cancelable subscription agreements. Unearned revenue primarily consists of billings or payments received in advance of revenue recognition from subscription services, including software licenses, described above and is recognized as revenue when transfer of control to customers has occurred. The Company generally invoices customers in annual installments. The unearned revenue balance is influenced by several factors, including seasonality, the compounding effects of renewals, invoice duration, invoice timing, dollar size and new business linearity within the quarter. The changes in unearned revenue were as follows (in millions ): ##TABLE_START  Fiscal Year Ended January 31, 2019 Unearned revenue, beginning of period $ 6,995 Billings and other* 14,770 Contribution from contract asset Revenue recognized ratably over time (12,426 ) Revenue recognized over time as delivered (629 ) Revenue recognized at a point in time (227 ) Unearned revenue from business combinations Unearned revenue, end of period $ 8,564 ##TABLE_END*Other includes, for example, the impact of foreign currency translation Revenue recognized ratably over time is generally billed in advance and includes Cloud Services, the related support and advisory services. Revenue recognized over time as delivered includes professional services billed on a time and material basis, fixed fee professional services and training classes that are primarily billed, delivered and recognized within the same reporting period. Revenue recognized at a point in time substantially includes the portion of software subscriptions allocated to the on-premise software element, which either resulted in smaller unearned revenue or a contract asset. Approximately 52 percent of revenue recognized in fiscal 2019 is from the unearned revenue balance as of January 31, 2018 . Remaining Performance Obligation Topic 606 also introduced the concept of the transaction price allocated to the remaining performance obligations, referred to by the Company as remaining performance obligation, which is different than unbilled deferred revenue under previous accounting guidance. Transaction price allocated to the remaining performance obligation represents contracted revenue that has not yet been recognized, which includes unearned revenue and unbilled amounts that will be recognized as revenue in future periods. Transaction price allocated to the remaining performance obligation is influenced by several factors, including seasonality, the timing of renewals, average contract terms and foreign currency exchange rates. Unbilled portions of the remaining performance obligation denominated in foreign currencies are revalued each period based on the period end exchange rates. The Company applied the practical expedient in accordance with Topic 606 to exclude amounts related to performance obligation that are billed and recognized as they are delivered. This primarily consists of professional services contracts that are on a time-and-material basis. The majority of the Company's noncurrent remaining performance obligation will be recognized in the next 13 to 36 months. Remaining performance obligation consisted of the following (in billions): ##TABLE_START  Current  Noncurrent  Total As of January 31, 2019* $ 11.9  $ 13.8  $ 25.7 ##TABLE_END*Includes $450 million of remaining performance obligation related to the MuleSoft acquisition, including contracts executed subsequent to acquisition. 3.

Fair Value Measurement The Company uses a three-tier fair value hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used in the valuation methodologies in measuring fair value: Level 1. Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. Level 2. Significant other inputs that are directly or indirectly observable in the marketplace. Level 3. Significant unobservable inputs which are supported by little or no market activity. All of the Companys cash equivalents, marketable securities and foreign currency derivative contracts are classified within Level 1 or Level 2 because the Companys cash equivalents, marketable securities and foreign currency derivative contracts are valued using quoted market prices or alternative pricing sources and models utilizing observable market inputs. The following table presents information about the Companys assets that are measured at fair value as of January 31, 2019 and indicates the fair value hierarchy of the valuation (in millions ): ##TABLE_START Description Quoted Prices in Active Markets for Identical Assets (Level 1)  Significant Other Observable Inputs (Level 2)  Significant Unobservable Inputs (Level 3)  Balance as of January 31, 2019 Cash equivalents (1):        Time deposits $  $  $  $ Money market mutual funds 1,234    1,234 Marketable securities:        Corporate notes and obligations  1,019   1,019 U.S. treasury securities    Mortgage backed obligations    Asset backed securities    Municipal securities    Foreign government obligations    U.S. agency obligations    Time deposits    Covered bonds    Strategic investments:        Publicly held equity securities    Foreign currency derivative contracts (2)    Total assets $ 1,670  $ 2,029  $  $ 3,699 ##TABLE_END___________ (1) Included in cash and cash equivalents in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet as of January 31, 2019 , in addition to $1.1 billion of cash.

As of January 31, 2019 , the noncurrent outstanding principal portion was $1.5 billion . 2019 Term Loan In July 2016, the Company entered into a credit agreement (Term Loan Credit Agreement) with Bank of America, N.A. and certain other institutional lenders for a $500 million term loan facility (2019 Term Loan) that matures in July 2019. In January 2019, the Company repaid the 2019 Term Loan in full and the Term Loan Credit Agreement was terminated. Loan Assumed on 50 Fremont The Company assumed a $200 million loan with the acquisition of 50 Fremont in San Francisco, California (Loan). The Loan bears an interest rate of 3.75 percent per annum and is due in June 2023. Starting in July 2018, principal and interest payments are required, with the remaining principal due at maturity. As of January 31, 2019 , the current and noncurrent outstanding principal portion was $3 million and $195 million , respectively. The Loan can be prepaid at any time subject to a yield maintenance fee. Convertible Senior Notes In March 2013, the Company issued at par value $1.15 billion of 0.25% convertible senior notes (the  0.25% Senior Notes, or Notes) due in April 2018. The Notes matured in April 2018 and the Company repaid $1.0 billion in cash of principal balance of the Notes during the Company's first quarter of fiscal 2019. The Company also distributed approximately 7 million shares of the Company's common stock to noteholders during fiscal 2019, which represents the conversion value in excess of the principal amount. To minimize the impact of potential economic dilution upon conversion of the Notes, also in March 2013, the Company entered into convertible note hedge transactions with respect to its common stock. The Company received approximately 7 million shares of the Company's common stock from the exercise of the notes hedges related to the 0.25% Senior Notes during this same period. Warrants In March 2013, the Company entered into a warrants transaction ( 0.25% Warrants), whereby the Company sold warrants to acquire, subject to anti-dilution adjustments, shares of the Companys common stock. The 0.25% Warrants were separate transactions entered into by the Company and were not part of the terms of the 0.25% Senior Notes or the related note hedges. In June 2018, the Company entered into agreements with each of the 0.25% Warrants counterparties to amend and early settle the 0.25% Warrants prior to their scheduled expiration beginning in July 2018. As a result of this amendment, during fiscal 2019, the Company issued, in the aggregate, approximately 6 million shares to the counterparties to settle, via a net share settlement, the entirety of the 0.25% Warrants, which increased the shares used in computing basic net income per share by 4 million for fiscal 2019 . Revolving Credit Facility In April 2018, the Company entered into a Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (\"Revolving Loan Credit Agreement\") with Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, and certain other institutional lenders that provides for $1.0 billion unsecured revolving credit facility (Credit Facility) that matures in April 2023. The Revolving Loan Credit Agreement amended and restated the Companys existing revolving credit facility dated July 2016. The Company may use the proceeds of future borrowings under the Credit Facility for refinancing other indebtedness, working capital, capital expenditures and other general corporate purposes, including permitted acquisitions. There were no outstanding borrowings under the Credit Facility as of January 31, 2019 . The Company continues to pay a commitment fee on the available amount of the Credit Facility, which is included within interest expense in the Company's consolidated statement of operations. Interest Expense on Debt The following table sets forth total interest expense recognized related to debt (in millions ): ##TABLE_START  Fiscal Year Ended January 31,    Contractual interest expense $  $  $ Amortization of debt issuance costs   Amortization of debt discount    $  $  $ ##TABLE_END10. Stockholders Equity The Company maintains the following stock plans: the ESPP, the 2013 Equity Incentive Plan and the 2014 Inducement Equity Incentive Plan (2014 Inducement Plan). As of January 31, 2019 and January 31, 2018 , $76 million and $63 million , respectively, was withheld on behalf of employees for future purchases under the ESPP and is recorded in accrued compensation. From February 1, 2006 through July 2013, options issued had a term of five years. After July 2013, options issued have a term of seven years. The fair value of each stock option grant was estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model with the following assumptions and fair value per share: ##TABLE_START  Fiscal Year Ended January 31, Stock Options    Volatility 27.0 - 28.0 %  28.0 - 31.4 %  31.4 - 32.3 % Estimated life 3.5 years   3.5 years   3.5 years  Risk-free interest rate 2.5 - 3.0 %  1.4 - 2.3 %  0.9 - 1.6 % Weighted-average fair value per share of grants $ 28.89   $ 22.71   $ 19.13  ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Fiscal Year Ended January 31, ESPP   Volatility 22.5 - 25.5 %  21.3 - 27.6 %  28.2 - 35.2 % Estimated life 0.75 years   0.75 years   0.75 years  Risk-free interest rate 2.0 - 2.6 %  1.1 - 1.7 %  0.5 - 1.0 % Weighted-average fair value per share of grants $ 32.90   $ 23.64   $ 20.18  ##TABLE_ENDThe Company estimated its future stock price volatility considering both its observed option-implied volatilities and its historical volatility calculations. Management believes this is the best estimate of the expected volatility over the expected life of its stock options and stock purchase rights. The estimated life for the stock options was based on an analysis of historical exercise activity. The risk-free interest rate is based on the rate for a U.S. government security with the same estimated life at the time of the option grant and the stock purchase rights. The estimated forfeiture rate applied is based on historical forfeiture rates. The Company does not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future and therefore uses an expected dividend yield of zero in the option pricing model. In fiscal 2016 and fiscal 2017, the Company granted performance-based restricted stock unit awards to the Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer and certain executive officers, including the Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer, respectively. In fiscal 2019, the Company granted additional performance-based restricted stock unit awards to certain employees, including the Chairman of the Board and Co-Chief Executive Officer and other senior executives. The performance-based restricted stock unit awards are subject to vesting based on a performance-based condition and a service-based condition. At the end of the three -year service period, based on the Company's share price performance, these performance-based restricted stock units will vest in a percentage of the target number of shares between 0 and 200% , depending on the extent the performance condition is achieved. Stock option activity, excluding the ESPP is as follows: ##TABLE_START    Options Outstanding  Shares Available for Grant (in thousands)  Outstanding Stock Options (in thousands)  Weighted- Average Exercise Price  Aggregate Intrinsic Value (in millions) Balance as of January 31, 2018 50,313  21,735  $ 65.96   Increase in shares authorized:        2013 Equity Incentive Plan 40,000   0.00   Assumed equity plans 8,357   0.00   Options granted under all plans (13,846 )  13,846  69.04   Restricted stock activity (19,937 )   0.00   Performance-based restricted stock units (1,911 )   0.00   Stock grants to board and advisory board members (146 )   0.00   Exercised  (8,495 )  44.40   Plan shares expired (163 )   0.00   Canceled 1,140  (1,140 )  77.59   Balance as of January 31, 2019 63,807  25,946  $ 74.15  $ 2,019 Vested or expected to vest   24,463  $ 72.65  $ 1,941 Exercisable as of January 31, 2019   12,770  $ 55.58  $ 1,231 ##TABLE_ENDThe total intrinsic value of the options exercised during fiscal 2019 , 2018 and 2017 was $784 million , $373 million and $224 million , respectively. The intrinsic value is the difference between the current market value of the stock and the exercise price of the stock option. The weighted-average remaining contractual life of vested and expected to vest options is approximately 5 years. As of January 31, 2019 , options to purchase 12.8 million shares were vested at a weighted average exercise price of $55.58 per share and had a remaining weighted-average contractual life of approximately 4 years. The total intrinsic value of these vested options as of January 31, 2019 was $1.2 billion . During fiscal 2019 , the Company recognized stock-based expense related to its equity plans for employees and non-employee directors of $1.3 billion . As of January 31, 2019 , the aggregate stock compensation remaining to be amortized to costs and expenses was approximately $2.5 billion . The Company will amortize this stock compensation balance as follows: $1.2 billion during fiscal 2020 ; $0.8 billion during fiscal 2021 ; $453 million during fiscal 2022 ; $108 million during fiscal 2023 and $8 million during fiscal 2024 . The expected amortization reflects only outstanding stock awards as of January 31, 2019 and assumes no forfeiture activity. The aggregate stock compensation remaining to be amortized to costs and expenses will be recognized over a weighted average period of 2 years.

The total fair value of shares vested during fiscal 2019 , 2018 and 2017 was $1.1 billion , $953 million and $640 million respectively. Common Stock The following number of shares of common stock were reserved and available for future issuance at January 31, 2019 (in thousands): ##TABLE_START Options outstanding 25,946 Restricted stock awards and units and performance-based stock units outstanding 21,159 Stock available for future grant or issuance:  2013 Equity Incentive Plan 63,342 2014 Inducement Plan Acquired equity plans Amended and Restated 2004 Employee Stock Purchase Plan 4,067  114,979 ##TABLE_ENDDuring fiscal years 2019 , 2018 and 2017 , certain board members received stock grants totaling 39,350 , 57,832 and 62,632 shares of common stock, respectively for board services pursuant to the terms described in the 2013 Plan and previously, the 2004 Outside Directors Stock Plan. The expense related to these awards, which was expensed immediately at the time of the issuance, totaled $5 million for each year in fiscal 2019 , 2018 and 2017 , respectively. Preferred Stock The Companys board of directors has the authority, without further action by stockholders, to issue up to 5,000,000 shares of preferred stock in one or more series. The Companys board of directors may designate the rights, preferences, privileges and restrictions of the preferred stock, including dividend rights, conversion rights, voting rights, terms of redemption, liquidation preference, sinking fund terms, and number of shares constituting any series or the designation of any series. The issuance of preferred stock could have the effect of restricting dividends on the Companys common stock, diluting the voting power of its common stock, impairing the liquidation rights of its common stock, or delaying or preventing a change in control. As of January 31, 2019 and 2018 , no shares of preferred stock were outstanding. 11. Income Taxes The domestic and foreign components of income before provision for (benefit from) income taxes consisted of the following (in millions): ##TABLE_START  Fiscal Year Ended January 31,    Domestic $  $  $ Foreign    $  $  $ ##TABLE_ENDThe provision for (benefit from) income taxes consisted of the following (in millions): ##TABLE_START  Fiscal Year Ended January 31,    Current:      Federal $  $ (7 )  $ State   Foreign   Total   Deferred:      Federal (248 )  (2 )  (183 ) State (37 )  (14 )  (26 ) Foreign  (4 )  (12 ) Total (283 )  (20 )  (221 ) Provision for (benefit from) income taxes $ (127 )  $  $ (144 ) ##TABLE_ENDIn fiscal 2019, the Company released a portion of its valuation allowance related to federal and state deferred tax assets, which was partially offset with the increase in unrecognized tax benefits. In addition, the Company recorded current tax expense for profitable jurisdictions outside of the United States. In fiscal 2018, the Company recorded tax expense primarily from profitable jurisdictions outside of the United States. In fiscal 2017, the Company recorded a net tax benefit of $144 million . The most significant component of this tax amount was the benefit of $210 million resulting from a partial release of its valuation allowance in connection with the acquisition of Demandware. The net deferred tax liability from acquisitions provided an additional source of income to support the realizability of the Company's pre-existing deferred tax assets and, as a result, the Company released a portion of its valuation allowance. The tax benefit associated with the release of the valuation allowance was partially offset by income taxes in profitable jurisdictions outside the United States. In addition, as a result of adopting Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-09, Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Shared Based Payment Accounting (ASU 2016-09\") and the Company's valuation allowance, it did not record significant current tax expense for the United States. A reconciliation of income taxes at the statutory federal income tax rate to the provision for (benefit from) income taxes included in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations is as follows (in millions): ##TABLE_START  Fiscal Year Ended January 31,    U.S. federal taxes at statutory rate (1) $  $  $ State, net of the federal benefit  (21 )  Effects of non-U.S. operations  (35 )  Tax credits (132 )  (107 )  (50 ) Non-deductible expenses   Excess tax benefits related to shared based compensation (137 )  (135 )  (95 ) Effect of U.S. tax law change   Change in valuation allowance (612 )   (179 ) Other, net (16 )  (5 )  Provision for (benefit from) income taxes $ (127 )  $  $ (144 ) ##TABLE_END (1) The Company's statutory rates were 21.0 percent and 33.8 percent for fiscal 2019 and fiscal 2018, respectively, which reflected the corporate tax rate reduction effective January 1, 2018 due to the Tax Act. In December 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (\"Tax Act\") was enacted into law, significantly changing income tax law that affects U.S. corporations. In fiscal 2018, due to the timing of the enactment and the complexity involved in applying the Tax Act, the Company recorded a provisional tax expense of $126 million associated with the re-measurement of deferred taxes for the corporate rate reduction, which was offset by a reduction in valuation allowance of $136 million . Also, based on the Company's provisional assessment, the transition tax had no impact to its income tax provision. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019, the Company completed its analysis, based on the guidance, interpretations and data available, and recorded additional expense of $43 million . The adjustment was primarily due to the reversal of a foreign tax credit benefit associated with a one-time distribution. On January 22, 2018, the FASB released guidance on the accounting for tax on the global intangible low-taxed income (GILTI) provisions of the Tax Act. The GILTI provisions impose a tax on foreign income in excess of a deemed return on tangible assets of foreign corporations. The Company has elected to recognize any potential GILTI obligation as an expense in the period it is incurred. The Company receives certain tax incentives in Singapore in the form of reduced tax rates, which will expire in fiscal 2020. The income tax benefits resulting from the reduced tax rates were immaterial in fiscal 2019, 2018, and 2017. Deferred Income Taxes Deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effect of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes. Significant components of the Companys deferred tax assets and liabilities were as follows (in millions): ##TABLE_START  As of January 31,   Deferred tax assets:    Net operating loss carryforwards $  $ Deferred stock-based expense  Tax credits  Deferred rent expense  Accrued liabilities  Basis difference on strategic and other investments  Financing obligation  Deferred intercompany transactions  Other  Total deferred tax assets 1,256  1,608 Less valuation allowance (205 )  (810 ) Deferred tax assets, net of valuation allowance 1,051  Deferred tax liabilities:    Deferred commissions (347 )  (334 ) Purchased intangibles (382 )  (205 ) Depreciation and amortization (145 )  (166 ) Basis difference on strategic and other investments (56 )  Deferred revenue (17 )  (82 ) Other  (5 ) Total deferred tax liabilities (947 )  (792 ) Net deferred tax assets $  $ ##TABLE_ENDAt January 31, 2019 , for federal income tax purposes, the Company had net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $2.1 billion , which expire in fiscal 2021 through fiscal 2038, federal research and development tax credits of approximately $381 million , which expire in fiscal 2020 through fiscal 2039, foreign tax credits of approximately $88 million , which expire in fiscal 2020 through fiscal 2029, and alternative minimum tax credits of $1 million , which the Company expects to receive as a refund under the Tax Act. For California income tax purposes, the Company had net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $765 million which expire beginning in fiscal 2020 through fiscal 2039, California research and development tax credits of approximately $281 million , which do not expire, and $9 million of enterprise zone tax credits, which expire in fiscal 2024 through fiscal 2026. For other states' income tax purposes, the Company had net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $1.0 billion , which expire beginning in fiscal 2021 through fiscal 2039 and tax credits of approximately $41 million , which expire beginning in fiscal 2021 through fiscal 2033. Utilization of the Companys net operating loss carryforwards may be subject to substantial annual limitation due to the ownership change limitations provided by the Internal Revenue Code and similar state provisions. Such an annual limitation could result in the expiration of the net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards before utilization. The Company had a valuation allowance of $205 million and $810 million as of January 31, 2019 and January 31, 2018 respectively. The Company regularly assesses the realizability of its deferred tax assets and establishes a valuation allowance if it is more-likely-than-not that some or all of its deferred tax assets will not be realized. The Company evaluates and weighs all available positive and negative evidence such as historic results, future reversals of existing deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income, as well as prudent and feasible tax-planning strategies. The assessment requires significant judgment and is performed in each of the applicable jurisdictions. The Company demonstrated sustained profitability evidenced by three consecutive years of positive earnings as well as forecasted continuing profitability at the worldwide and U.S. jurisdictional levels. As a result, the Company determined that there was sufficient positive evidence to release a portion of its valuation allowance related to federal and state deferred tax assets, resulting in a tax benefit of $612 million during fiscal 2019. The valuation allowance at the end of January 31, 2019 was primarily related to net operating loss and tax credits in certain state jurisdictions. The Company will continue to evaluate the need for valuation allowances for its deferred tax assets. Tax Benefits Related to Stock-Based Compensation The total income tax benefit in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations related to stock-based awards was $236 million , $265 million and $229 million for fiscal 2019 , 2018 and 2017 , respectively. For fiscal 2018 and 2017, majority of the tax benefit was not recognized as a result of the valuation allowance. Unrecognized Tax Benefits and Other Considerations The Company records liabilities related to its uncertain tax positions. Tax positions for the Company and its subsidiaries are subject to income tax audits by multiple tax jurisdictions throughout the world. The Company recognizes the tax benefit of an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the position is sustainable upon examination by the taxing authority, based on the technical merits. The tax benefit recognized is measured as the largest amount of benefit which is greater than 50 percent likely to be realized upon settlement with the taxing authority. The Company had gross unrecognized tax benefits of $852 million , $304 million , and $231 million as of January 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017 respectively. A reconciliation of the beginning and ending balance of total unrecognized tax benefits for fiscal years 2019 , 2018 and 2017 is as follows (in millions): ##TABLE_START  Fiscal Year Ended January 31,    Beginning of period $  $  $ Tax positions taken in prior period:      Gross increases   Gross decreases (2 )  (6 )  (1 ) Tax positions taken in current period:      Gross increases   Settlements (15 )  (1 )  (16 ) Lapse of statute of limitations (10 )  (8 )  (1 ) Currency translation effect (6 )   End of period $  $  $ ##TABLE_ENDDuring fiscal 2019, the Company reported an increase of approximately $548 million in its unrecognized tax benefits primarily for tax issues related to the integrations of certain historical acquisitions as a result of recent developments of on-going audits and court cases. For fiscal 2019 , total unrecognized tax benefits in an amount of $631 million , if recognized, would reduce income tax expense and the Companys effective tax rate. For fiscal 2018 and 2017 , total unrecognized tax benefits in an amount of $77 million and $73 million , respectively, if recognized, would reduce income tax expense and the Companys effective tax rate after considering the impact of the change in valuation allowance in the U.S. The Company recognizes accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in the income tax provision. The Company recorded an immaterial amount for penalties and interest for each of fiscal 2019 , 2018 and 2017 . The balance in the non-current income tax payable related to penalties and interest was $10 million , $6 million and $7 million as of January 31, 2019 , 2018 and 2017, respectively. Certain prior year tax returns are currently being examined by various taxing authorities in countries including the United States, France, United Kingdom and Germany. In March 2017, the Company received the final notice of proposed adjustments primarily related to transfer pricing issues from the IRS. The Company is currently appealing the IRS proposed adjustments. The Company believes that it has provided adequate reserves for its income tax uncertainties in all open tax years. As the outcome of the tax audits cannot be predicted with certainty, if any issues addressed in the Company's tax audits are resolved in a manner inconsistent with management's expectations, the Company could adjust its provision for income taxes in the future. The Company has operations and taxable presence in multiple jurisdictions in the U.S. and outside of the U.S. Tax positions for the Company and its subsidiaries are subject to income tax audits by multiple tax jurisdictions around the world. The Company currently considers U.S. federal and state, Canada, Japan, Australia, Germany, France and the United Kingdom to be major tax jurisdictions. The Companys U.S. federal and state tax returns since February 1999, which was the inception of the Company, remain open to examination. With some exceptions, tax years prior to fiscal 2016 in jurisdictions outside of U.S. are generally closed. However, in Japan and United Kingdom, the Company is no longer subject to examinations for years prior to fiscal 2015 and fiscal 2017, respectively. The Company anticipates it is reasonably possible that a decrease of unrecognized tax benefits up to approximately $3 million may occur in the next 12 months, as the applicable statutes of limitations lapse. 12. Earnings Per Share Basic earnings per share is computed by dividing net income by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding for the fiscal period. Diluted earnings per share is computed by giving effect to all potential weighted average dilutive common stock, including options, restricted stock units, warrants and the convertible senior notes. The dilutive effect of outstanding awards and convertible securities is reflected in diluted earnings per share by application of the treasury stock method. A reconciliation of the denominator used in the calculation of basic and diluted earnings per share is as follows (in millions ): ##TABLE_START 4 Fiscal Year Ended January 31,    Numerator:      Net income $ 1,110  $  $ Denominator:      Weighted-average shares outstanding for basic earnings per share   Effect of dilutive securities:      Convertible senior notes which matured in April 2018   Employee stock awards   Warrants   Adjusted weighted-average shares outstanding and assumed conversions for diluted earnings per share   ##TABLE_ENDThe weighted-average number of shares outstanding used in the computation of diluted earnings per share does not include the effect of the following potential outstanding common stock. The effects of these potentially outstanding shares were not included in the calculation of diluted earnings per share because the effect would have been anti-dilutive (in millions): ##TABLE_START  Fiscal Year Ended January 31,    Employee stock awards   Warrants   ##TABLE_END13. Commitments Letters of Credit As of January 31, 2019 , the Company had a total of $92 million in letters of credit outstanding substantially in favor of certain landlords for office space. These letters of credit renew annually and expire at various dates through December 2030.  Leases The Company leases facilities space and certain fixed assets under non-cancelable operating and capital leases with various expiration dates. As of January 31, 2019 , the future minimum lease payments under non-cancelable operating and capital leases are as follows (in millions ): ##TABLE_START  Capital Leases (1)  Operating Leases (2)  Financing Obligation -Leased Facility (3) Fiscal Period:      Fiscal 2020 $  $  $ Fiscal 2021   Fiscal 2022   Fiscal 2023   Fiscal 2024   Thereafter  1,610  Total minimum lease payments  $ 4,195  $ Less: amount representing interest (9 )     Present value of capital lease obligations $     ##TABLE_END(1) As of January 31, 2019 , the capital lease obligation is included in accrued expenses and other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet. (2) Operating leases do not include sublease income. The Company has entered into various sublease agreements with third parties. Under these agreements, the Company expects to receive sublease income of approximately $146 million in the next five years and $79 million thereafter. (3) Total Financing Obligation - Leased Facility noted above represents the total obligation on the lease agreement including amounts allocated to interest and the implied lease for the land. As of January 31, 2019 , $215 million of the total $279 million above was recorded to Financing obligation leased facility, of which the current portion is included in accrued expenses and other liabilities and the noncurrent portion is included in other noncurrent liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet. The table above excludes renewal terms for facilities and certain services that provide the Company with the option to renew. The Company's future contractual obligations would change if the Company exercised these options. In addition, the table above excludes two separate agreements for office facilities to be constructed. As of January 31, 2019 construction has not commenced on either of these buildings and the timing of completion of construction is unknown. Due to this uncertainty the entire commitment for these two obligations are excluded from the table above. These agreements are as follows: ##TABLE_START  approximately 324,000 rentable square feet of office space in a building to be constructed as part of the Company's urban campus in San Francisco, California. As of January 31, 2019 , construction has not yet commenced on the building and is dependent on the developer obtaining approval from the City and County of San Francisco. The Company expects to begin occupying the space in fiscal 2024 and the total non-cancelable minimum payments under this agreement are approximately $480 million over 16 years . Construction has not commenced on the building and is dependent on the developer obtaining approvals from the City and County of San Francisco. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  approximately 603,000 rentable square feet of office space in a building to be constructed in Chicago, Illinois. As of January 31, 2019 construction has not yet commenced on the building. The Company expects to begin occupying the space in fiscal 2022 and the total non-cancelable minimum payments under this agreement are approximately $475 million over 17 years . ##TABLE_END The terms of the lease agreements provide for rental payments on a graduated basis. The Company recognizes rent expense on a straight-line basis over the lease period and has accrued for rent expense incurred but not paid. Of the total operating lease commitment balance of $4.2 billion , approximately $3.5 billion is related to facilities space. The remaining commitment amount is related to computer equipment and furniture and fixtures. Rent expense for fiscal 2019, 2018 and 2017 was $365 million , $285 million and $226 million , respectively. The Company has entered into various contractual commitments with infrastructure service providers for a total commitment of $2.0 billion . The Company paid $156 million in connection with these agreements during fiscal 2019. As of January 31, 2019 the total remaining commitment is approximately $1.8 billion and $264 million is due in the next fiscal year. 14. Employee Benefit Plans The Company has a 401(k) plan covering all eligible employees in the United States and a Registered Retirement Savings plan covering all eligible employees in Canada. Since January 1, 2006, the Company has been contributing to the plans. Total Company contributions during fiscal 2019 , 2018 and 2017 , were $106 million , $93 million and $56 million , respectively. 15. Legal Proceedings and Claims In the ordinary course of business, the Company is or may be involved in various legal or regulatory proceedings, claims or purported class actions related to alleged infringement of third-party patents and other intellectual property rights, commercial, corporate and securities, labor and employment, wage and hour, and other claims. The Company has been, and may in the future be put on notice and/or sued by third-parties for alleged infringement of their proprietary rights, including patent infringement. In general, the resolution of a legal matter could prevent the Company from offering its service to others, could be material to the Companys financial condition or cash flows, or both, or could otherwise adversely affect the Companys operating results. The Company makes a provision for a liability relating to legal matters when it is both probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. These provisions are reviewed at least quarterly and adjusted to reflect the impacts of negotiations, estimated settlements, legal rulings, advice of legal counsel and other information and events pertaining to a particular matter. The outcomes of legal proceedings and other contingencies are, however, inherently unpredictable and subject to significant uncertainties. As a result, the Company is not able to reasonably estimate the amount or range of possible losses in excess of any amounts accrued, including losses that could arise as a result of application of non-monetary remedies, with respect to the contingencies it faces, and the Companys estimates may not prove to be accurate. In managements opinion, resolution of all current matters is not expected to have a material adverse impact on the Companys consolidated results of operations, cash flows or financial position. However, depending on the nature and timing of any such dispute or other contingency, an unfavorable resolution of a matter could materially affect the Companys current or future results of operations or cash flows, or both, in a particular quarter. In December 2018, the Company was named as a nominal defendant and certain of its current and former directors were named as defendants in a purported shareholder derivative action in the Delaware Court of Chancery. The complaint alleged that excessive compensation was paid to such directors for their service, included claims of breach of fiduciary duty and unjust enrichment, and sought restitution and disgorgement of a portion of the directors' compensation. Subsequently, three similar shareholder derivative actions were filed in the Delaware Court of Chancery. The cases have been consolidated under the caption In re Salesforce.com, Inc. Derivative Litigation . The Company believes that the ultimate outcome of this litigation will not materially and adversely affect its business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. 16. Related-Party Transactions In January 1999, the Salesforce.com Foundation, also referred to as the Foundation, was chartered on an idea of leveraging the Companys people, technology and resources to help improve communities around the world. The Company calls this integrated philanthropic approach the 1-1-1 model. Beginning in 2008, Salesforce.org, which is a non-profit public benefit corporation, was established to resell the Company's services to nonprofit organizations and certain higher education organizations. The Companys Chairman is the chairman of both the Foundation and Salesforce.org. The Companys Chairman holds one of the three Foundation board seats. The Companys Chairman, one of the Companys employees and one of the Companys board members hold three of Salesforce.orgs nine board seats. The Company does not control the Foundations or Salesforce.org's activities, and accordingly, the Company does not consolidate either of the related entities' statement of activities with its financial results. Since the Foundations and Salesforce.orgs inception, the Company has provided at no charge certain resources to those entities' employees such as office space, furniture, equipment, facilities, services and other resources. The value of these items was approximately $15 million , $11 million and $3 million for fiscal 2019 , 2018 and 2017, respectively. Additionally, the Company allows Salesforce.org to donate subscriptions of the Companys services to other qualified non-profit organizations. The Company also allows Salesforce.org to resell the Companys service to non-profit organizations and certain education entities. The Company does not charge Salesforce.org for these subscriptions, therefore income from subscriptions sold to non-profit organizations is donated back to the community through charitable grants made by the Foundation and Salesforce.org. The value of the subscriptions sold by Salesforce.org pursuant to the reseller agreement, as amended, was approximately $253 million , $183 million and $112 million for fiscal 2019 , 2018 and 2017, respectively. 17.

CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES ##TABLE_END (a) Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive officers and principal financial officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act), as of the end of the period covered by this report. In designing and evaluating our disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any disclosure controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. In addition, the design of disclosure controls and procedures must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and that management is required to apply its judgment in evaluating the benefits of possible controls and procedures relative to their costs. Based on managements evaluation, our principal executive officers and principal financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are designed to, and are effective to, provide assurance at a reasonable level that the information we are required to disclose in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in Securities and Exchange Commission rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our chief executive officers and chief financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. (b) Managements Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f). Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our chief executive officers and chief financial officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of January 31, 2019 based on the guidelines established in the Internal ControlIntegrated Framework (2013 framework) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). Our internal control over financial reporting includes policies and procedures that provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external reporting purposes in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. In accordance with guidance issued by the Securities and Exchange Commission, companies are permitted to exclude acquisitions from their final assessment of internal control over financial reporting for the first fiscal year in which the acquisition occurred. Our managements evaluation of internal control over financial reporting excluded the internal control activities of MuleSoft, Inc. (MuleSoft), which we acquired in May 2018, as discussed in Note 7, \"Business Combinations,\" of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. We have included the financial results of MuleSoft in the consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisition. Total revenues subject to MuleSofts internal control over financial reporting represented approximately three percent of our consolidated total revenues for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2019. Total net income subject to MuleSofts internal control over financial reporting represented approximately three percent of our consolidated total net income for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2019. Total assets subject to MuleSoft's internal control over financial reporting represented approximately two percent of our consolidated total assets, excluding acquisition method fair value adjustments, as of January 31, 2019. Total net assets subject to MuleSoft's internal control over financial reporting represented approximately one percent of our consolidated net assets, excluding acquisition method fair value adjustments, as of January 31, 2019. Based on the results of our evaluation, our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of January 31, 2019 . We reviewed the results of managements assessment with our Audit Committee. The effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of January 31, 2019 has been audited by Ernst  Young LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in its report which is included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. (c) Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting There was no change in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended January 31, 2019 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. (d) Inherent Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls Our management, including our chief executive officers and chief financial officer, do not expect that our disclosure controls or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the Company have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty, and that breakdowns can occur because of a simple error or mistake. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people or by management override of the controls. The design of any system of controls is also based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions; over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or the degree of compliance with policies or procedures may deteriorate. Because of the inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected. ##TABLE_START ", "9B": " ITEM 9B.
