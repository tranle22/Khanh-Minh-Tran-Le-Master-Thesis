BUSINESS General Johnson  Johnson and its subsidiaries have approximately 115,500 employees worldwide engaged in the research and development, manufacture and sale of a broad range of products in the health care field. Johnson  Johnson is a holding company, which has more than 250 operating companies conducting business in virtually all countries of the world. Johnson  Johnsons primary focus has been on products related to human health and well-being. Johnson  Johnson was incorporated in the State of New Jersey in 1887. The Companys structure is based on the principle of decentralized management. The Executive Committee of Johnson  Johnson is the principal management group responsible for the operations and allocation of the resources of the Company. This Committee oversees and coordinates the activities of the Consumer, Pharmaceutical and Medical Devices and Diagnostics business segments. Each subsidiary within the business segments is, with some exceptions, managed by citizens of the country where it is located. Segments of Business Johnson  Johnsons operating companies are organized into three business segments: Consumer, Pharmaceutical and Medical Devices and Diagnostics. Additional information required by this item is incorporated herein by reference to the narrative and tabular (but not the graphic) descriptions of segments and operating results under the captions Managements Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition on pages 26 through 35 and Note 18 Segments of Business and Geographic Areas under Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements on page 55 of the Annual Report, filed as Exhibit 13 to this Report on Form 10-K. Consumer The Consumer segment includes a broad range of products used in the baby care, skin care, oral care, wound care and womens health care fields, as well as nutritional and over-the-counter pharmaceutical products, and wellness and prevention platforms. The Baby Care franchise includes the JOHNSONS  Baby line of products. Major brands in the Skin Care franchise include the AVEENO  ; CLEAN  CLEAR  ; JOHNSONS  Adult; NEUTROGENA  ; RoC  ; LUBRIDERM  ; Dabao; and Vendme product lines. The Oral Care franchise includes the LISTERINE  and REACH  oral care lines of products. The Wound Care franchise includes BAND-AID  brand adhesive bandages and PURELL  instant hand sanitizer products. Major brands in the Womens Health franchise are the CAREFREE  Pantiliners; STAYFREE  sanitary protection products; and Vania Expansion products. The nutritional and over-the-counter lines include SPLENDA  , No Calorie Sweetener; the broad family of TYLENOL  acetaminophen products; SUDAFED  cold, flu and allergy products; ZYRTEC  allergy products; MOTRIN  IB ibuprofen products; and PEPCID  AC Acid Controller from Johnson  Johnson  Merck Consumer Pharmaceuticals Co. These products are marketed to the general public and sold both to retail outlets and distributors throughout the world. Pharmaceutical The Pharmaceutical segment includes products in the following therapeutic areas: anti-infective, antipsychotic, cardiovascular, contraceptive, dermatology, gastrointestinal, hematology, immunology, neurology, oncology, pain management, urology and virology. These products are distributed directly to retailers, wholesalers and health care professionals for prescription use. Key products in the Pharmaceutical segment include: REMICADE  (infliximab), a biologic approved for the treatment of a number of immune mediated inflammatory diseases; PROCRIT  (Epoetin alfa, sold outside the U.S. as EPREX  ), a biotechnology-derived product that stimulates red blood cell production; LEVAQUIN  (levofloxacin) in the anti-infective field; RISPERDAL  CONSTA  (risperidone), a long-acting injectable for the treatment of schizophrenia; CONCERTA  (methylphenidate HCl), a product for the treatment of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder; ACIPHEX  /PARIET  , a proton pump inhibitor co-marketed with Eisai Inc.; DURAGESIC  /Fentanyl Transdermal (fentanyl transdermal system, sold outside the U.S. as DUROGESIC  ), a treatment for chronic pain that offers a novel delivery system; VELCADE  (bortezomib), a product for the treatment for multiple myeloma; PREZISTA  (darunavir) for the treatment of HIV/AIDS patients; and INVEGA  (paliperidone), a once-daily atypical antipsychotic. Medical Devices and Diagnostics The Medical Devices and Diagnostics segment includes a broad range of products distributed to wholesalers, hospitals and retailers, used principally in the professional fields by physicians, nurses, therapists, hospitals, diagnostic laboratories and clinics. These products include Cordis circulatory disease management products; DePuys orthopaedic joint reconstruction, spinal care and sports medicine products; Ethicons surgical care, aesthetics and womens health products; Ethicon Endo-Surgerys minimally invasive surgical products; LifeScans blood glucose monitoring and insulin delivery products; Ortho-Clinical Diagnostics professional diagnostic products; and Vistakons disposable contact lenses. Distribution to these health care professional markets is done both directly and through surgical supply and other dealers. Geographic Areas The international business of Johnson  Johnson is conducted by subsidiaries located in 59 countries outside the United States, which are selling products in virtually all countries throughout the world. The products made and sold in the international business include many of those described above under  Segments of Business  Consumer,  Pharmaceutical and  Medical Devices and Diagnostics. However, the principal markets, products and methods of distribution in the international business vary with the country and the culture. The products sold in international business include not only those developed in the United States, but also those developed by subsidiaries abroad. Investments and activities in some countries outside the United States are subject to higher risks than comparable U.S. activities because the investment and commercial climate is influenced by restrictive economic policies and political uncertainties. Raw Materials Raw materials essential to Johnson  Johnsons operating companies businesses are generally readily available from multiple sources. Patents and Trademarks Johnson  Johnson and its subsidiaries have made a practice of obtaining patent protection on their products and processes where possible. They own or are licensed under a number of patents relating to their products and manufacturing processes, which in the aggregate are believed to be of material importance to Johnson  Johnson in the operation of its businesses. Sales of the Companys largest product, REMICADE  (infliximab), accounted for approximately 7% of Johnson  Johnsons total revenues for fiscal 2009. Accordingly, the patents related to this product are believed to be material to Johnson  Johnson. During 2007 through 2009, RISPERDAL  (risperidone) oral and TOPAMAX  (topiramate) lost basic patent protection and market exclusivity and became subject to generic competition in the United States and international markets. RISPERDAL  oral sales declined by 57.7% and 37.8% in 2009 and 2008, respectively. TOPAMAX  lost market exclusivity in March 2009 and sales declined by 57.9% as compared to 2008. The next significant patent scheduled to expire on December 20, 2010 is for LEVAQUIN  (levofloxacin), which accounted for 2.5% of the Companys 2009 sales. A pediatric extension for LEVAQUIN  was granted by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), which extends market exclusivity in the United States through June 20, 2011. Johnson  Johnsons operating companies have made a practice of selling their products under trademarks and of obtaining protection for these trademarks by all available means. These trademarks are protected by registration in the United States and other countries where such products are marketed. Johnson  Johnson considers these trademarks in the aggregate to be of material importance in the operation of its businesses. Seasonality Worldwide sales do not reflect any significant degree of seasonality; however, spending has been heavier in the fourth quarter of each year than in other quarters. This reflects increased spending decisions, principally for advertising and research and development activity. Competition In all of their product lines, Johnson  Johnsons operating companies compete with companies both large and small, and both local and global, located throughout the world. Competition exists in all product lines without regard to the number and size of the competing companies involved. Competition in research, involving the development and the improvement of new and existing products and processes, is particularly significant. The development of new and innovative products is important to Johnson  Johnsons success in all areas of its business. This also includes protecting the Companys portfolio of intellectual property. The competitive environment requires substantial investments in continuing research and in maintaining sales forces. In addition, the development and maintenance of customer demand for the Companys consumer products involves significant expenditures for advertising and promotion. Research and Development Research activities represent a significant part of Johnson  Johnsons subsidiaries businesses. Major research facilities are located not only in the United States, but also in Belgium, Brazil, Canada, China, France, Germany, India, Israel, Japan, the Netherlands, Singapore and the United Kingdom. The costs of worldwide Company-sponsored research activities relating to the development of new products, improvement of existing products, technical support of products and compliance with governmental regulations for the protection of consumers and patients (excluding purchased in-process research and development charges for fiscal 2008 and 2007), amounted to $7.0 billion, $7.6 billion and $7.7 billion for fiscal years 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. These costs are charged directly to expense, or directly against income, in the year in which incurred. Environment Johnson  Johnsons operating companies are subject to a variety of U.S. and international environmental protection measures. Johnson  Johnson believes that its operations comply in all material respects with applicable environmental laws and regulations. Johnson  Johnsons compliance with these requirements did not during the past year, and is not expected to, have a material effect upon its capital expenditures, cash flows, earnings or competitive position. Regulation Most of Johnson  Johnsons businesses are subject to varying degrees of governmental regulation in the countries in which operations are conducted, and the general trend is toward increasingly stringent regulation. In the United States, the drug, device, diagnostics and cosmetic industries have long been subject to regulation by various federal and state agencies, primarily as to product safety, efficacy, manufacturing, advertising, labeling and safety reporting. The exercise of broad regulatory powers by the FDA continues to result in increases in the amounts of testing and documentation required for FDA clearance of new drugs and devices and a corresponding increase in the expense of product introduction. Similar trends are also evident in major markets outside of the United States. The costs of human health care have been and continue to be a subject of study, investigation and regulation by governmental agencies and legislative bodies around the world. In the United States, attention has been focused on drug prices and profits and programs that encourage doctors to write prescriptions for particular drugs or recommend, use or purchase particular medical devices. Payers have become a more potent force in the market place and increased attention is being paid to drug and medical device pricing, appropriate drug and medical device utilization and the quality and costs of health care. The regulatory agencies under whose purview Johnson  Johnsons operating companies operate have administrative powers that may subject those companies to such actions as product withdrawals, recalls, seizure of products and other civil and criminal sanctions. In some cases, Johnson  Johnsons operating companies may deem it advisable to initiate product recalls. In addition, business practices in the health care industry have come under increased scrutiny, particularly in the United States, by government agencies and state attorneys general, and resulting investigations and prosecutions carry the risk of significant civil and criminal penalties. ##TABLE_START Available Information ##TABLE_END The Companys main corporate Web site address is www.jnj.com.

CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES ##TABLE_END Disclosure Controls and Procedures. At the end of the period covered by this report, the Company evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of its disclosure controls and procedures. The Companys disclosure controls and procedures are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SECs rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the Companys management, including its principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.

Managements Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Under Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, management is required to assess the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting as of the end of each fiscal year and report, based on that assessment, whether the Companys internal control over financial reporting is effective. Management of the Company is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. The Companys internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance as to the reliability of the Companys financial reporting and the preparation of external financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Internal control over financial reporting, no matter how well designed, has inherent limitations. Therefore, internal control over financial reporting determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and may not prevent or detect all misstatements. Moreover, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. The Companys management has assessed the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting as of January 3, 2010. In making this assessment, the Company used the criteria established by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal Control-Integrated Framework. These criteria are in the areas of control environment, risk assessment, control activities, information and communication, and monitoring. The Companys assessment included extensive documenting, evaluating and testing the design and operating effectiveness of its internal control over financial reporting. Based on the Companys processes and assessment, as described above, management has concluded that, as of January 3, 2010, the Companys internal control over financial reporting was effective. The effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting as of January 3, 2010 has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report, which appears in the Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm on page 64 of the Annual Report, which is incorporated herein by reference and filed as Exhibit 13 to this Report on Form 10-K. Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. During the fiscal quarter ended January 3, 2010, there were no changes in the Companys internal control over financial reporting identified in connection with the evaluation of such referred to above in this Item 9A that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Companys internal control over financial reporting. ##TABLE_START ", "9B": " Item 9B.

BUSINESS ##TABLE_END General Johnson  Johnson and its subsidiaries have approximately 114,000 employees worldwide engaged in the research and development, manufacture and sale of a broad range of products in the health care field. Johnson  Johnson is a holding company, which has more than 250 operating companies conducting business in virtually all countries of the world. Johnson  Johnsons primary focus has been on products related to human health and well-being. Johnson  Johnson was incorporated in the State of New Jersey in 1887. The Companys structure is based on the principle of decentralized management. The Executive Committee of Johnson  Johnson is the principal management group responsible for the operations and allocation of the resources of the Company. This Committee oversees and coordinates the activities of the Consumer, Pharmaceutical and Medical Devices and Diagnostics business segments. Each subsidiary within the business segments is, with some exceptions, managed by citizens of the country where it is located. Segments of Business Johnson  Johnsons operating companies are organized into three business segments: Consumer, Pharmaceutical and Medical Devices and Diagnostics. Additional information required by this item is incorporated herein by reference to the narrative and tabular (but not the graphic) descriptions of segments and operating results under the captions Managements Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition on pages 30 through 40 and Note 18 Segments of Business and Geographic Areas under Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements on page 61 of the Annual Report, filed as Exhibit 13 to this Report on Form 10-K. Consumer The Consumer segment includes a broad range of products used in the baby care, skin care, oral care, wound care and womens health care fields, as well as nutritional and over-the-counter pharmaceutical products, and wellness and prevention platforms. The Baby Care franchise includes the JOHNSONS  Baby line of products. Major brands in the Skin Care franchise include the AVEENO  ; CLEAN  CLEAR  ; JOHNSONS  Adult; NEUTROGENA  ; RoC  ; LUBRIDERM  ; DABAO tm ; and Vendme product lines. The Oral Care franchise includes the LISTERINE  and REACH  oral care lines of products. The Wound Care franchise includes BAND-AID  brand adhesive bandages and Neosporin  First Aid products. Major brands in the Womens Health franchise are the CAREFREE  Pantiliners; o.b.  tampons and STAYFREE  sanitary protection products. The nutritional and over-the-counter lines include SPLENDA  , No Calorie Sweetener; the broad family of TYLENOL  acetaminophen products; SUDAFED  cold, flu and allergy products; ZYRTEC  allergy products; MOTRIN  IB ibuprofen products; and PEPCID  AC Acid Controller from Johnson  Johnson  Merck Consumer Pharmaceuticals Co. These products are marketed to the general public and sold both to retail outlets and distributors throughout the world. Pharmaceutical The Pharmaceutical segment includes products in the following areas: anti-infective, antipsychotic, contraceptive, dermatology, gastrointestinal, hematology, immunology, neurology, oncology, pain management and virology. These products are distributed directly to retailers, wholesalers and health care professionals for prescription use. Key products in the Pharmaceutical segment include: REMICADE  (infliximab), a treatment for a number of immune mediated inflammatory diseases; STELARA  (ustekinumab), a treatment for moderate to severe plaque psoriasis; SIMPONI  (golimumab), a treatment for adults with moderate to severe rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, and ankylosing spondylitis; VELCADE  (bortezomib), a treatment for multiple myeloma; PREZISTA  (darunavir) and INTELENCE  (etravirine), treatments for HIV/AIDS; NUCYNTA  (tapentadol), a treatment for moderate to severe acute pain; INVEGA  SUSTENNA tm (paliperidone palmitate), for the acute and maintenance treatment of schizophrenia in adults; RISPERDAL  CONSTA  (risperidone), a treatment for the management of Bipolar I Disorder and schizophrenia; PROCRIT  (Epoetin alfa, sold outside the U.S. as EPREX  ), to stimulate red blood cell production; LEVAQUIN  (levofloxacin) for the treatment of bacterial infections; CONCERTA  (methylphenidate HCl), a treatment for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder;  ACIPHEX  /PARIET  , a proton pump inhibitor co-marketed with Eisai Inc.; DURAGESIC  /Fentanyl Transdermal (fentanyl transdermal system, sold outside the U.S. as DUROGESIC  ), a treatment for chronic pain that offers a novel delivery system.

Distribution to these health care professional markets is done both directly and through surgical supply and other dealers. Geographic Areas The business of Johnson  Johnson is conducted by more than 250 operating companies located in 60 countries, including the United States, which are selling products in virtually all countries throughout the world. The products made and sold in the international business include many of those described above under  Segments of Business  Consumer,  Pharmaceutical and  Medical Devices and Diagnostics. However, the principal markets, products and methods of distribution in the international business vary with the country and the culture. The products sold in international business include not only those developed in the United States, but also those developed by subsidiaries abroad. Investments and activities in some countries outside the United States are subject to higher risks than comparable U.S. activities because the investment and commercial climate is influenced by restrictive economic policies and political uncertainties. Raw Materials Raw materials essential to Johnson  Johnsons operating companies businesses are generally readily available from multiple sources. Patents and Trademarks Johnson  Johnson and its subsidiaries have made a practice of obtaining patent protection on their products and processes where possible. They own or are licensed under a number of patents relating to their products and manufacturing processes, which in the aggregate are believed to be of material importance to Johnson  Johnson in the operation of its businesses. Sales of the Companys largest product, REMICADE  (infliximab), accounted for approximately 7% of Johnson  Johnsons total revenues for fiscal 2010. Accordingly, the patents related to this product are believed to be material to Johnson  Johnson. In March of 2009, TOPAMAX  (topiramate) lost basic patent protection and market exclusivity and became subject to generic competition in the United States and later in the year in international markets. Sales of TOPAMAX  declined by 53.3% and 57.9% in 2010 and 2009, respectively. The next significant patent that will expire is for LEVAQUIN  (levofloxacin), which accounted for approximately 2% of the Companys 2010 sales. A pediatric extension for LEVAQUIN  was granted by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), which extends market exclusivity in the United States through June 20, 2011. Johnson  Johnsons operating companies have made a practice of selling their products under trademarks and of obtaining protection for these trademarks by all available means. These trademarks are protected by registration in the United States and other countries where such products are marketed. Johnson  Johnson considers these trademarks in the aggregate to be of material importance in the operation of its businesses.  Seasonality Worldwide sales do not reflect any significant degree of seasonality; however, spending has been heavier in the fourth quarter of each year than in other quarters. This reflects increased spending decisions, principally for advertising and research and development activity. Competition In all of their product lines, Johnson  Johnsons operating companies compete with companies both local and global, located throughout the world. Competition exists in all product lines without regard to the number and size of the competing companies involved. Competition in research, involving the development and the improvement of new and existing products and processes, is particularly significant. The development of new and innovative products is important to Johnson  Johnsons success in all areas of its business. This also includes protecting the Companys portfolio of intellectual property. The competitive environment requires substantial investments in continuing research and in maintaining sales forces. In addition, the development and maintenance of customer demand for the Companys consumer products involves significant expenditures for advertising and promotion. Research and Development Research activities represent a significant part of Johnson  Johnsons subsidiaries businesses. Major research facilities are located not only in the United States, but also in Belgium, Brazil, Canada, China, France, Germany, India, Israel, Japan, the Netherlands, Singapore and the United Kingdom. The costs of worldwide Company-sponsored research activities relating to the development of new products, improvement of existing products, technical support of products and compliance with governmental regulations for the protection of consumers and patients (excluding purchased in-process research and development charges for fiscal 2008), amounted to $6.8 billion, $7.0 billion and $7.6 billion for fiscal years 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. These costs are charged directly to expense, or directly against income, in the year in which incurred. Environment Johnson  Johnsons operating companies are subject to a variety of U.S. and international environmental protection measures. Johnson  Johnson believes that its operations comply in all material respects with applicable environmental laws and regulations. Johnson  Johnsons compliance with these requirements did not during the past year, and is not expected to, have a material effect upon its capital expenditures, cash flows, earnings or competitive position. Regulation Most of Johnson  Johnsons businesses are subject to varying degrees of governmental regulation in the countries in which operations are conducted, and the general trend is toward increasingly stringent regulation. In the United States, the drug, device, diagnostics and cosmetic industries have long been subject to regulation by various federal and state agencies, primarily as to product safety, efficacy, manufacturing, advertising, labeling and safety reporting. The exercise of broad regulatory powers by the FDA continues to result in increases in the amounts of testing and documentation required for FDA clearance of new drugs and devices and a corresponding increase in the expense of product introduction. Similar trends are also evident in major markets outside of the United States. The costs of human health care have been and continue to be a subject of study, investigation and regulation by governmental agencies and legislative bodies around the world. In the United States, attention has been focused on drug prices and profits and programs that encourage doctors to write prescriptions for particular drugs or recommend, use or purchase particular medical devices. Payers have become a more potent force in the market place and increased attention is being paid to drug and medical device pricing, appropriate drug and medical device utilization and the quality and costs of health care. The regulatory agencies under whose purview Johnson  Johnsons operating companies operate have administrative powers that may subject those companies to such actions as product withdrawals, recalls, seizure of products and other civil and criminal sanctions. In some cases, Johnson  Johnsons operating companies may deem it advisable to initiate product recalls.  In addition, business practices in the health care industry have come under increased scrutiny, particularly in the United States, by government agencies and state attorneys general, and resulting investigations and prosecutions carry the risk of significant civil and criminal penalties.

CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES ##TABLE_END Disclosure Controls and Procedures. At the end of the period covered by this report, the Company evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of its disclosure controls and procedures. The Companys disclosure controls and procedures are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SECs rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the Companys management, including its principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. William C. Weldon, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, and Dominic J. Caruso, Chief Financial Officer, reviewed and participated in this evaluation. Based on this evaluation, Messrs. Weldon and Caruso concluded that, as of the end of the period covered by this report, the Companys disclosure controls and procedures were effective. Managements Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Under Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, management is required to assess the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting as of the end of each fiscal year and report, based on that assessment, whether the Companys internal control over financial reporting is effective. Management of the Company is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. The Companys internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance as to the reliability of the Companys financial reporting and the preparation of external financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Internal control over financial reporting, no matter how well designed, has inherent limitations. Therefore, internal control over financial reporting determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and may not prevent or detect all misstatements. Moreover, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.  The Companys management has assessed the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting as of January 2, 2011. In making this assessment, the Company used the criteria established by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal Control-Integrated Framework. These criteria are in the areas of control environment, risk assessment, control activities, information and communication, and monitoring. The Companys assessment included extensive documenting, evaluating and testing the design and operating effectiveness of its internal control over financial reporting. Based on the Companys processes and assessment, as described above, management has concluded that, as of January 2, 2011, the Companys internal control over financial reporting was effective. The effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting as of January 2, 2011 has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report, which appears in the Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm on page 72 of the Annual Report, which is incorporated herein by reference and filed as Exhibit 13 to this Report on Form 10-K. Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. During the fiscal quarter ended January 2, 2011, there were no changes in the Companys internal control over financial reporting identified in connection with the evaluation required under Rules 13a-15 and 15d-15 under the Exchange Act that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Companys internal control over financial reporting. ##TABLE_START ", "9B": " Item 9B.

BUSINESS ##TABLE_END General Johnson  Johnson and its subsidiaries (the Company) have approximately 117,900 employees worldwide engaged in the research and development, manufacture and sale of a broad range of products in the health care field. Johnson  Johnson is a holding company, which has more than 250 operating companies conducting business in virtually all countries of the world. Johnson  Johnsons primary focus has been on products related to human health and well-being. Johnson  Johnson was incorporated in the State of New Jersey in 1887. The Companys structure is based on the principle of decentralized management. The Executive Committee of Johnson  Johnson is the principal management group responsible for the strategic operations and allocation of the resources of the Company. This Committee oversees and coordinates the activities of the Consumer, Pharmaceutical and Medical Devices and Diagnostics business segments. In line with the principle of decentralized management, senior management groups at U.S. and international operating companies are each responsible for their own strategic plans, as well as the day-to-day operations of those companies, and each subsidiary within the business segments is, with some exceptions, managed by citizens of the country where it is located. Segments of Business Johnson  Johnsons operating companies are organized into three business segments: Consumer, Pharmaceutical and Medical Devices and Diagnostics. Additional information required by this item is incorporated herein by reference to the narrative and tabular (but not the graphic) descriptions of segments and operating results under the captions Managements Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition on pages 26 through 36 and Note 18 Segments of Business and Geographic Areas under Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements on page 56 of the Annual Report, filed as Exhibit 13 to this Report on Form 10-K. Consumer The Consumer segment includes a broad range of products used in the baby care, skin care, oral care, wound care and womens health fields, as well as nutritional and over-the-counter pharmaceutical products, and wellness and prevention platforms. The Baby Care franchise includes the JOHNSONS  Baby line of products. Major brands in the Skin Care franchise include the AVEENO  ; CLEAN  CLEAR  ; JOHNSONS  Adult; NEUTROGENA  ; RoC  ; LUBRIDERM  ; DABAO; and VENDME  product lines. The Oral Care franchise includes the LISTERINE  and REACH  oral care lines of products. The Wound Care franchise includes BAND-AID  brand adhesive bandages and NEOSPORIN  First Aid products. Major brands in the Womens Health franchise are the CAREFREE  Pantiliners; o.b.  tampons and STAYFREE  sanitary protection products. The nutritional and over-the-counter lines include SPLENDA  No Calorie Sweetener; the broad family of TYLENOL  acetaminophen products; SUDAFED  cold, flu and allergy products; ZYRTEC  allergy products; MOTRIN  IB ibuprofen products; and PEPCID  AC Acid Controller. These products are marketed to the general public and sold both to retail outlets and distributors throughout the world. Pharmaceutical The Pharmaceutical segment includes products in the following areas: anti-infective, antipsychotic, contraceptive, dermatology, gastrointestinal, hematology, immunology, infectious diseases, neurology, oncology, pain management, thrombosis and vaccines. These products are distributed directly to retailers, wholesalers and health care professionals for prescription use. Key products in the Pharmaceutical segment include: REMICADE  (infliximab), a treatment for a number of immune mediated inflammatory diseases; STELARA  (ustekinumab), a treatment for moderate to severe plaque psoriasis; SIMPONI  (golimumab), a treatment for adults with moderate to severe rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, and ankylosing spondylitis; VELCADE  (bortezomib), a treatment for multiple myeloma; ZYTIGA  (abiraterone acetate), a treatment for metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer; PREZISTA  (darunavir), INTELENCE  (etravirine) and EDURANT  (rilpivirine), treatments for HIV/AIDS; INCIVO  (telaprevir), for the treatment of hepatitis C; NUCYNTA  (tapentadol), a treatment for moderate to severe acute pain; INVEGA  SUSTENNA  (paliperidone palmitate), for the acute and maintenance treatment of schizophrenia in adults; RISPERDAL  CONSTA  (risperidone), a treatment for the management of Bipolar I Disorder and schizophrenia; XARELTO  (rivaroxaban), a treatment for the prevention of thrombosis following total hip or knee replacement surgery and for the prevention of stroke in patients with atrial fibrillation; PROCRIT  (Epoetin alfa, sold outside the U.S. as EPREX  ), to stimulate red blood cell production; LEVAQUIN  (levofloxacin), for the treatment of bacterial infections; CONCERTA  (methylphenidate HCl), a treatment for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder; ACIPHEX  /PARIET  , a proton pump inhibitor co-marketed with Eisai Inc.; and DURAGESIC  /Fentanyl Transdermal (fentanyl transdermal system, sold outside the U.S. as DUROGESIC  ), a treatment for chronic pain that offers a novel delivery system. Medical Devices and Diagnostics The Medical Devices and Diagnostics segment includes a broad range of products distributed to wholesalers, hospitals and retailers, used principally in the professional fields by physicians, nurses, therapists, hospitals, diagnostic laboratories and clinics. These products include Cardiovascular Cares electrophysiology and circulatory disease management products; DePuys orthopaedic joint reconstruction, spinal care, neurological and sports medicine products; Diabetes Cares blood glucose monitoring and insulin delivery products; Ethicons surgical care, aesthetics and womens health products; Ethicon Endo-Surgerys minimally invasive surgical products and advanced sterilization products; Ortho-Clinical Diagnostics professional diagnostic products; and Vision Cares disposable contact lenses. Distribution to these health care professional markets is done both directly and through surgical supply and other distributors. Geographic Areas The business of Johnson  Johnson is conducted by more than 250 operating companies located in 60 countries, including the United States, which sell products in virtually all countries throughout the world. The products made and sold in the international business include many of those described above under Segments of BusinessConsumer, Pharmaceutical and Medical Devices and Diagnostics. However, the principal markets, products and methods of distribution in the international business vary with the country and the culture. The products sold in international business include not only those developed in the United States, but also those developed by subsidiaries abroad. Investments and activities in some countries outside the United States are subject to higher risks than comparable U.S. activities because the investment and commercial climate may be influenced by restrictive economic policies and political uncertainties. Raw Materials Raw materials essential to the business of Johnson  Johnsons operating companies are generally readily available from multiple sources. Where there are exceptions, the temporary unavailability of those raw materials would not likely have a material adverse effect on the financial results of the Company. Patents and Trademarks Johnson  Johnson and its subsidiaries have made a practice of obtaining patent protection on their products and processes where possible. They own or are licensed under a number of patents relating to their products and  manufacturing processes, which in the aggregate are believed to be of material importance to Johnson  Johnson in the operation of its businesses. Sales of the Companys largest product, REMICADE  (infliximab), accounted for 8.4% of Johnson  Johnsons total revenues for fiscal 2011. Accordingly, the patents related to this product are believed to be material to Johnson  Johnson. In June of 2011, LEVAQUIN  lost market exclusivity and became subject to generic competition in the United States. Sales of LEVAQUIN  declined 54.1% in 2011 as compared to 2010. Johnson  Johnsons operating companies have made a practice of selling their products under trademarks and of obtaining protection for these trademarks by all available means. These trademarks are protected by registration in the United States and other countries where such products are marketed. Johnson  Johnson considers these trademarks in the aggregate to be of material importance in the operation of its businesses. Seasonality Worldwide sales do not reflect any significant degree of seasonality; however, spending has been heavier in the fourth quarter of each year than in other quarters. This reflects increased spending decisions, principally for advertising and research and development activity. Competition In all of their product lines, Johnson  Johnsons operating companies compete with companies both locally and globally, throughout the world. Competition exists in all product lines without regard to the number and size of the competing companies involved. Competition in research, involving the development and the improvement of new and existing products and processes, is particularly significant. The development of new and innovative products is important to the Companys success in all areas of its business. This also includes protecting the Companys portfolio of intellectual property. The competitive environment requires substantial investments in continuing research and in maintaining sales forces. In addition, the development and maintenance of customer demand for the Companys consumer products involves significant expenditures for advertising and promotion. Research and Development Research activities represent a significant part of Johnson  Johnsons subsidiaries businesses. Research and development expenditures relate to the processes of discovering, testing and developing new products, improving existing products, as well as demonstrating product efficacy and regulatory compliance prior to launch. The Company remains committed to investing in research and development with the aim of delivering high quality and innovative products. Worldwide costs of research and development activities amounted to $7.5 billion, $6.8 billion and $7.0 billion for fiscal years 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. Major research facilities are located not only in the United States, but also in Belgium, Brazil, Canada, China, France, Germany, India, Israel, Japan, the Netherlands, Singapore and the United Kingdom. Environment Johnson  Johnsons operating companies are subject to a variety of U.S. and international environmental protection measures. The Company believes that its operations comply in all material respects with applicable environmental laws and regulations. The Companys compliance with these requirements did not during the past year, and is not expected to, have a material effect upon its capital expenditures, cash flows, earnings or competitive position. Regulation Most of Johnson  Johnsons businesses are subject to varying degrees of governmental regulation in the countries in which operations are conducted, and the general trend is toward increasingly stringent regulation. In  the United States, the drug, device, diagnostics and cosmetic industries have long been subject to regulation by various federal and state agencies, primarily as to product safety, efficacy, manufacturing, advertising, labeling and safety reporting. The exercise of broad regulatory powers by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (the FDA) continues to result in increases in the amounts of testing and documentation required for FDA clearance of new drugs and devices and a corresponding increase in the expense of product introduction. Similar trends are also evident in major markets outside of the United States. The costs of human health care have been and continue to be a subject of study, investigation and regulation by governmental agencies and legislative bodies around the world. In the United States, attention has been focused on drug prices and profits and programs that encourage doctors to write prescriptions for particular drugs or recommend, use or purchase particular medical devices. Payers have become a more potent force in the market place and increased attention is being paid to drug and medical device pricing, appropriate drug and medical device utilization and the quality and costs of health care. The regulatory agencies under whose purview Johnson  Johnsons operating companies operate have administrative powers that may subject those companies to actions such as product withdrawals, recalls, seizure of products and other civil and criminal sanctions. In some cases, Johnson  Johnsons operating companies may deem it advisable to initiate product recalls. In addition, business practices in the health care industry have come under increased scrutiny, particularly in the United States, by government agencies and state attorneys general, and resulting investigations and prosecutions carry the risk of significant civil and criminal penalties.

Research facilities are also discussed in Item 1 under BusinessResearch and Development. Johnson  Johnsons subsidiaries generally seek to own their manufacturing facilities, although some, principally in locations abroad, are leased. Office and warehouse facilities are often leased. The Company is committed to maintaining all of its properties in good operating condition and repair, and the facilities are well utilized. During the first fiscal quarter of 2011, a consent decree was signed with the FDA, which requires McNEIL-PPC, Inc. to take enhanced measures to remediate certain facilities it operates. McNEIL-PPC voluntarily shut down its Fort Washington, Pennsylvania facility in April 2010. This facility will remain shut down until rebuilding is complete, a third-party consultant certifies that its operations will be in compliance with applicable law, and the FDA concurs with the third-party certification.

In addition, Johnson  Johnson and its subsidiaries are from time to time party to government investigations, inspections or other proceedings relating to environmental matters, including their compliance with applicable environmental laws. In connection with a routine inspection of a subsidiarys manufacturing facility, the California Department of Toxic Substances Control (the Department) has alleged violation of regulations dealing with the handling of certain wastes. The Company believes that adequate defenses to those allegations exist and is presently in discussions with the Department regarding the validity of such allegations. Although the Company cannot predict the ultimate outcome of any proceeding that may be brought regarding these matters, the Company expects that this matter will be resolved without significant penalties or other adverse impact to the Company. ##TABLE_START ", "4": " Item 4.

CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES ##TABLE_END Disclosure Controls and Procedures. At the end of the period covered by this report, the Company evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of its disclosure controls and procedures. The Companys disclosure controls and procedures are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SECs rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the Companys management, including its principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. William C. Weldon, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, and Dominic J. Caruso, Chief Financial Officer, reviewed and participated in this evaluation. Based on this evaluation, Messrs. Weldon and Caruso concluded that, as of the end of the period covered by this report, the Companys disclosure controls and procedures were effective. Managements Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Under Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, management is required to assess the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting as of the end of each fiscal year and report, based on that assessment, whether the Companys internal control over financial reporting is effective.  Management of the Company is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. The Companys internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance as to the reliability of the Companys financial reporting and the preparation of external financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Internal control over financial reporting, no matter how well designed, has inherent limitations. Therefore, internal control over financial reporting determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and may not prevent or detect all misstatements. Moreover, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. The Companys management has assessed the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting as of January 1, 2012. In making this assessment, the Company used the criteria established by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal Control-Integrated Framework. These criteria are in the areas of control environment, risk assessment, control activities, information and communication, and monitoring. The Companys assessment included extensive documenting, evaluating and testing the design and operating effectiveness of its internal control over financial reporting. Based on the Companys processes and assessment, as described above, management has concluded that, as of January 1, 2012, the Companys internal control over financial reporting was effective.

BUSINESS ##TABLE_END General Johnson  Johnson and its subsidiaries (the \"Company\") have approximately 127,600 employees worldwide engaged in the research and development, manufacture and sale of a broad range of products in the health care field. Johnson  Johnson is a holding company, which has more than 275 operating companies conducting business in virtually all countries of the world. The Companys primary focus has been on products related to human health and well-being. Johnson  Johnson was incorporated in the State of New Jersey in 1887. The Companys structure is based on the principle of decentralized management. The Executive Committee of Johnson  Johnson is the principal management group responsible for the strategic operations and allocation of the resources of the Company. This Committee oversees and coordinates the activities of the Consumer, Pharmaceutical and Medical Devices and Diagnostics business segments. In line with the principle of decentralized management, senior management groups at U.S. and international operating companies are each responsible for their own strategic plans, as well as the day-to-day operations of those companies, and each subsidiary within the business segments is, with some exceptions, managed by citizens of the country where it is located. Segments of Business The Company is organized into three business segments: Consumer, Pharmaceutical and Medical Devices and Diagnostics. Additional information required by this item is incorporated herein by reference to the narrative and tabular descriptions of segments and operating results under the caption Managements Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition and Note 18 Segments of Business and Geographic Areas under Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements of the Annual Report, filed as Exhibit 13 to this Report on Form 10-K. Consumer The Consumer segment includes a broad range of products used in the baby care, skin care, oral care, wound care and womens health care fields, as well as nutritional and over-the-counter pharmaceutical products, and wellness and prevention platforms. The Baby Care franchise includes the JOHNSONS  Baby line of products. Major brands in the Skin Care franchise include the AVEENO  ; CLEAN  CLEAR  ; JOHNSONS  Adult; NEUTROGENA  ; RoC  ; LUBRIDERM  ; DABAO  ; and VENDME  product lines. Brands in the Oral Care franchise include the LISTERINE  and REMBRANDT  oral care lines, as well as REACH  interdental products. The Wound Care franchise includes BAND-AID  brand adhesive bandages and NEOSPORIN  First Aid products. Major brands in the Womens Health franchise are CAREFREE  pantiliners; o.b.  tampons and STAYFREE  sanitary protection products. The principal nutritional line is SPLENDA  No Calorie Sweetener. Over-the-counter medicines include the broad family of TYLENOL  acetaminophen products; SUDAFED  cold, flu and allergy products; ZYRTEC  allergy products; MOTRIN  IB ibuprofen products; and PEPCID  AC  Acid Controller. These products are marketed to the general public and sold both to retail outlets and distributors throughout the world. Pharmaceutical The Pharmaceutical segment includes products in the following areas: anti-infective, antipsychotic, contraceptive, gastrointestinal, hematology, immunology, infectious diseases, neurology, oncology, pain management, thrombosis and vaccines. These products are distributed directly to retailers, wholesalers and health care professionals for prescription use. Key products in the Pharmaceutical segment include: REMICADE  (infliximab), a treatment for a number of immune-mediated inflammatory diseases; STELARA  (ustekinumab), a treatment for adults with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis; SIMPONI  (golimumab), a treatment for adults with moderate to severe rheumatoid arthritis, active psoriatic arthritis, and active ankylosing spondylitis; VELCADE  (bortezomib), a treatment for multiple myeloma; ZYTIGA  (abiraterone acetate), a treatment for metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer; PREZISTA  (darunavir), INTELENCE  (etravirine) and EDURANT  (rilpivirine), treatments for HIV/AIDS; INCIVO  (telaprevir), for the treatment of hepatitis C; NUCYNTA  ER (tapentadol) extended release tablets, a treatment for moderate to severe chronic pain in adults and neuropathic pain associated with diabetic peripheral neuropathy in adults; INVEGA  SUSTENNA  (paliperidone palmitate), for the acute and maintenance treatment of schizophrenia in adults; INVEGA  (paliperidone) extended-release tablets, for the treatment of of schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorder; RISPERDAL  CONSTA  (risperidone), a treatment for the management of Bipolar I Disorder and schizophrenia; XARELTO  (rivaroxaban), an oral anticoagulant for the prevention of thrombosis following total hip or knee replacement surgery, for the prevention of stroke in patients with atrial fibrillation, for the treatment of pulmonary embolism (PE) or deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or to reduce the risk of recurrence of DVT or PE following an initial six months of treatment for acute venous thromboembolism; PROCRIT  (epoetin alfa, sold outside the U.S. as EPREX  ), to stimulate red blood cell production; LEVAQUIN  (levofloxacin) for the treatment of bacterial infections; CONCERTA  (methylphenidate HCl) extended-release tablets CII, a treatment for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder; ACIPHEX  /PARIET  , a proton pump inhibitor co-marketed with Eisai Inc.; and DURAGESIC  / (fentanyl transdermal system) CII, sold outside the U.S. as DUROGESIC  , a treatment for chronic pain that offers a novel delivery system. Medical Devices and Diagnostics The Medical Devices and Diagnostics segment includes a broad range of products used principally in the professional fields by physicians, nurses, hospitals, and clinics. These include products to treat cardiovascular disease; orthopaedic and neurological products; blood glucose monitoring and insulin delivery products; general surgery, biosurgical, and energy products; professional diagnostic products; infection prevention products; and disposable contact lenses. These products are distributed to wholesalers, hospitals and retailers both directly and through surgical supply and other distributors. Geographic Areas The business of Johnson  Johnson is conducted by more than 275 operating companies located in 60 countries, including the United States, which sell products in virtually all countries throughout the world. The products made and sold in the international business include many of those described above under  Segments of Business  Consumer,  Pharmaceutical and  Medical Devices and Diagnostics. However, the principal markets, products and methods of distribution in the international business vary with the country and the culture. The products sold in international business include not only those developed in the United States, but also those developed by subsidiaries abroad. Investments and activities in some countries outside the United States are subject to higher risks than comparable U.S. activities because the investment and commercial climate may be influenced by restrictive economic policies and political uncertainties. Raw Materials Raw materials essential to the Company's business are generally readily available from multiple sources. Where there are exceptions, the temporary unavailability of those raw materials would not likely have a material adverse effect on the financial results of the Company. Patents and Trademarks The Company's subsidiaries have made a practice of obtaining patent protection on their products and processes where possible. They own or are licensed under a number of patents relating to their products and manufacturing processes, which in the aggregate are believed to be of material importance to the Company in the operation of its businesses. Sales of the Companys largest product, REMICADE  (infliximab), accounted for approximately 9.1% of the Company's total revenues for fiscal 2012. Accordingly, the patents related to this product are believed to be material to the Company. In June of 2011, LEVAQUIN  lost market exclusivity and became subject to generic competition in the United States. Sales of LEVAQUIN  , in the United States, declined approximately 94% in 2012 as compared to 2011. The Companys subsidiaries have made a practice of selling their products under trademarks and of obtaining protection for these trademarks by all available means. These trademarks are protected by registration in the United States and other countries where such products are marketed. The Company considers these trademarks in the aggregate to be of material importance in the operation of its businesses. Seasonality Worldwide sales do not reflect any significant degree of seasonality; however, spending has been heavier in the fourth quarter of each year than in other quarters. This reflects increased spending decisions, principally for advertising and research and development activity. Competition In all of their product lines, the Company's subsidiaries compete with companies both locally and globally, throughout the world. Competition exists in all product lines without regard to the number and size of the competing companies involved. Competition in research, involving the development and the improvement of new and existing products and processes, is particularly significant. The development of new and innovative products is important to the Companys success in all areas of its business. This also includes protecting the Companys portfolio of intellectual property. The competitive environment requires substantial investments in continuing research and in maintaining sales forces. In addition, the development and maintenance of customer demand for the Companys consumer products involves significant expenditures for advertising and promotion. Research and Development Research activities represent a significant part of the Companys businesses. Research and development expenditures relate to the processes of discovering, testing and developing new products, improving existing products, as well as demonstrating product efficacy and regulatory compliance prior to launch. The Company remains committed to investing in research and development with the aim of delivering high quality and innovative products. Worldwide costs of research and development activities amounted to $7.7 billion, $7.5 billion and $6.8 billion for fiscal years 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively. Major research facilities are located not only in the United States, but also in Belgium, Brazil, Canada, China, France, Germany, India, Israel, Japan, the Netherlands, Singapore, Switzerland and the United Kingdom. Environment The Company is subject to a variety of U.S. and international environmental protection measures. The Company believes that its operations comply in all material respects with applicable environmental laws and regulations. The Companys compliance with these requirements did not during the past year, and is not expected to, have a material effect upon its capital expenditures, cash flows, earnings or competitive position. Regulation Most of the Companys businesses are subject to varying degrees of governmental regulation in the countries in which operations are conducted, and the general trend is toward increasingly stringent regulation. In the United States, the drug, device, diagnostics and cosmetic industries have long been subject to regulation by various federal and state agencies, primarily as to product safety, efficacy, manufacturing, advertising, labeling and safety reporting. The exercise of broad regulatory powers by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (the \"FDA\") continues to result in increases in the amounts of testing and documentation required for FDA clearance of new drugs and devices and a corresponding increase in the expense of product introduction. Similar trends are also evident in major markets outside of the United States. The costs of human health care have been and continue to be a subject of study, investigation and regulation by governmental agencies and legislative bodies around the world. In the United States, attention has been focused on drug prices and profits and programs that encourage doctors to write prescriptions for particular drugs or recommend, use or purchase particular medical devices. Payers have become a more potent force in the market place and increased attention is being paid to drug and medical device pricing, appropriate drug and medical device utilization and the quality and costs of health care. F ollowing the U.S. Supreme Court decision in June 2012 upholding the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (the \"ACA\"), there has been an increase in the pace of regulatory issuances by those U.S. government agencies designated to carry out the extensive requirements of the ACA. These have both positive and negative impacts on the U.S. healthcare industry with much remaining uncertain as to how various provisions of the ACA will ultimately affect the industry. The regulatory agencies under whose purview the Company operates have administrative powers that may subject it to actions such as product withdrawals, recalls, seizure of products and other civil and criminal sanctions. In some cases, the Companys subsidiaries may deem it advisable to initiate product recalls. In addition, business practices in the health care industry have come under increased scrutiny, particularly in the United States, by government agencies and state attorneys general, and resulting investigations and prosecutions carry the risk of significant civil and criminal penalties.

Research facilities are also discussed in Item 1 under Business  Research and Development. The Company's subsidiaries generally seek to own their manufacturing facilities, although some, principally in locations abroad, are leased. Office and warehouse facilities are often leased. The Company is committed to maintaining all of its properties in good operating condition and repair, and the facilities are well utilized. McNEIL-PPC, Inc. continues to operate under a consent decree signed in 2011 with the FDA, which governs certain McNeil Consumer Healthcare manufacturing operations. McNEIL-PPC, Inc. continues to operate the manufacturing facilities in Las Piedras, Puerto Rico and Lancaster, Pennsylvania; however, production volumes from these facilities continue to be impacted by additional review and approval processes required under the consent decree. The Company expects this to continue throughout most of 2013. Plants operating under the consent decree will produce a simplified portfolio focused on key brands. The Fort Washington, Pennsylvania manufacturing site is not in operation at this time. McNeil continues to work on the re-siting of the products previously produced at the Fort Washington facility to other facilities. A discussion of this matter can be found under the heading Government Proceedings - McNeil Consumer Healthcare in Note 21 Legal Proceedings under Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Annual Report, which is filed as Exhibit 13 to this Report of Form 10-K.

LEGAL PROCEEDINGS ##TABLE_END The information set forth in Note 21 Legal Proceedings under Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements of the Annual Report is incorporated herein by reference and filed as Exhibit 13 to this Report on Form 10-K. In addition, Johnson  Johnson and its subsidiaries are from time to time party to government investigations, inspections or other proceedings relating to environmental matters, including their compliance with applicable environmental laws. In connection with a routine inspection of a subsidiary's manufacturing facility, the California Department of Toxic Substances Control (the \"Department\") has alleged violation of regulations dealing with the handling of certain wastes. The Company believes that adequate defenses to those allegations exist and is presently in discussions with the Department regarding the validity of such allegations. Although the Company cannot predict the ultimate outcome of any proceeding that may be brought regarding these matters, the Company expects that this matter will be resolved without significant penalties or other adverse impact to the Company. ##TABLE_START ", "4": " Item 4.

BUSINESS ##TABLE_END General Johnson  Johnson and its subsidiaries (the \"Company\") have approximately 128,100 employees worldwide engaged in the research and development, manufacture and sale of a broad range of products in the health care field. Johnson  Johnson is a holding company, which has more than 275 operating companies conducting business in virtually all countries of the world. The Companys primary focus has been on products related to human health and well-being. Johnson  Johnson was incorporated in the State of New Jersey in 1887. The Companys structure is based on the principle of decentralized management. The Executive Committee of Johnson  Johnson is the principal management group responsible for the strategic operations and allocation of the resources of the Company. This Committee oversees and coordinates the activities of the Consumer, Pharmaceutical and Medical Devices and Diagnostics business segments. Within the strategic parameters provided by the Committee, senior management groups at U.S. and international operating companies are each responsible for their own strategic plans, as well as the day-to-day operations of those companies, and each subsidiary within the business segments is, with some exceptions, managed by citizens of the country where it is located. Segments of Business The Company is organized into three business segments: Consumer, Pharmaceutical and Medical Devices and Diagnostics. Additional information required by this item is incorporated herein by reference to the narrative and tabular descriptions of segments and operating results under the caption Managements Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition and Note 18 Segments of Business and Geographic Areas under Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements of the Annual Report, filed as Exhibit 13 to this Report on Form 10-K. Consumer The Consumer segment includes a broad range of products used in the baby care, skin care, oral care, wound care and womens health fields, as well as nutritionals, over-the-counter pharmaceutical products and wellness and prevention platforms. The Baby Care franchise includes the JOHNSONS  Baby line of products. Major brands in the Skin Care franchise include the AVEENO  ; CLEAN  CLEAR  ; DABAO  ; JOHNSONS  Adult; LUBRIDERM  ; NEUTROGENA  ; RoC  ; and VENDME  product lines. Brands in the Oral Care franchise include the LISTERINE  oral care lines. The Wound Care franchise includes BAND-AID  Brand Adhesive Bandages and NEOSPORIN  First Aid products. Major brands in the Womens Health franchise outside of North America are STAYFREE  and CAREFREE  sanitary pad and o.b.  tampon brands. The principal nutritional line is SPLENDA  No Calorie Sweetener. Over-the-counter medicines include the broad family of TYLENOL  acetaminophen products; SUDAFED  cold, flu and allergy products; ZYRTEC  allergy products; MOTRIN  IB ibuprofen products; and PEPCID  line of heartburn products. These products are marketed to the general public and sold both to retail outlets and distributors throughout the world. Pharmaceutical The Pharmaceutical segment includes products in the following areas: anti-infective, antipsychotic, cardiovascular, contraceptive, gastrointestinal, hematology, immunology, infectious diseases, metabolic, neurology, oncology, pain management and vaccines. These products are distributed directly to retailers, wholesalers and health care professionals for prescription use. Key products in the Pharmaceutical segment include: REMICADE  (infliximab), a treatment for a number of immune-mediated inflammatory diseases; SIMPONI  (golimumab), a treatment for adults with moderate to severe rheumatoid arthritis, active psoriatic arthritis, active ankylosing spondylitis and moderately active to severely active ulcerative colitis; STELARA  (ustekinumab), a treatment for adults with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis and active psoriatic arthritis; INCIVO  (telaprevir), for the treatment of hepatitis C; INTELENCE  (etravirine) and PREZISTA  (darunavir), treatments for HIV/AIDS; CONCERTA  (methylphenidate HCl) extended-release tablets CII, a treatment for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder; INVEGA  (paliperidone) extended-release tablets, for the treatment of schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorder; INVEGA  SUSTENNA  /XEPLION  (paliperidone palmitate), for the treatment of schizophrenia in adults; RISPERDAL  CONSTA  (risperidone), for the treatment of schizophrenia and for the maintenance treatment of Bipolar I Disorder; VELCADE  (bortezomib), a treatment for multiple myeloma; ZYTIGA  (abiraterone acetate), a treatment for metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer; ACIPHEX  /PARIET  , a proton pump inhibitor co-marketed with Eisai Inc.; PROCRIT  (epoetin alfa, sold outside the U.S. as EPREX  ), to stimulate red blood cell production; and XARELTO  (rivaroxaban), an oral anticoagulant for the prevention of deep vein thrombosis (DVT), which may lead to pulmonary embolism (PE) in patients undergoing hip or knee replacement surgery, to reduce the risk of stroke and systemic embolism in patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation, for the treatment of DVT and PE, and for the reduction in the risk of recurrence of DVT and PE. Medical Devices and Diagnostics The Medical Devices and Diagnostics segment includes a broad range of products distributed to wholesalers, hospitals and retailers, used principally in the professional fields by physicians, nurses, hospitals, and clinics. These include products to treat cardiovascular disease; orthopaedic and neurological products; blood glucose monitoring and insulin delivery products; general surgery, biosurgical, and energy products; professional diagnostic products; infection prevention products; and disposable contact lenses. Geographic Areas The business of Johnson  Johnson is conducted by more than 275 operating companies located in 60 countries, including the United States, which sell products in virtually all countries throughout the world. The products made and sold in the international business include many of those described above under  Segments of Business  Consumer,  Pharmaceutical and  Medical Devices and Diagnostics. However, the principal markets, products and methods of distribution in the international business vary with the country and the culture. The products sold in international business include not only those developed in the United States, but also those developed by subsidiaries abroad. Investments and activities in some countries outside the United States are subject to higher risks than comparable U.S. activities because the investment and commercial climate may be influenced by restrictive economic policies and political uncertainties. Raw Materials Raw materials essential to the Company's business are generally readily available from multiple sources. Where there are exceptions, the temporary unavailability of those raw materials would not likely have a material adverse effect on the financial results of the Company. Patents and Trademarks The Company's subsidiaries have made a practice of obtaining patent protection on their products and processes where possible. They own or are licensed under a number of patents relating to their products and manufacturing processes, which in the aggregate are believed to be of material importance to the Company in the operation of its businesses. Sales of the Companys largest product, REMICADE  (infliximab), accounted for approximately 9.4% of the Company's total revenues for fiscal 2013. Accordingly, the patents related to this product are believed to be material to the Company. There are two sets of patents related to REMICADE  (infliximab). The first set of patents is co-owned by Janssen Biotech, Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of Johnson  Johnson, and New York University Medical Center (NYU). Janssen Biotech, Inc. has an exclusive license to NYU's interests in the patents. Patents have been granted in the United States, certain countries in the European Union (certain of these patents have been extended by Supplementary Patent Certificates), and Australia.  In the United States, the patent expires in September 2018. These patents expired in Canada in March 2012. In certain countries in Europe the patent has  been extended to February 2015 (Germany, Spain, United Kingdom, Sweden, Austria, Belgium, Switzerland, Denmark, France,  Greece, Italy, Luxembourg and the Netherlands). In Australia, the patent expires in March 2017.   The second set of patents related to REMICADE  was granted to the Kennedy Institute of Rheumatology in the United Kingdom in Europe, Canada, Australia and the United States. Janssen Biotech, Inc. has an exclusive license to these patents which expire in 2017 outside of the United States and 2018 in the United States. The validity of these patents has been challenged and is currently in litigation.  Loss of exclusivity for REMICADE  in the above-mentioned markets may result in a reduction in sales. Johnson  Johnson does not expect that any additional extensions will be available for the patents related to REMICADE  . In addition to competing in the immunology market with REMICADE  , the Company is currently marketing STELARA  (ustekinumab), SIMPONI  (golimumab) and SIMPONI  ARIA (golimumab), next generation immunology products with remaining patent lives of 10 years. The Companys subsidiaries have made a practice of selling their products under trademarks and of obtaining protection for these trademarks by all available means. These trademarks are protected by registration in the United States and other countries where such products are marketed. The Company considers these trademarks in the aggregate to be of material importance in the operation of its businesses. Seasonality Worldwide sales do not reflect any significant degree of seasonality; however, spending has been heavier in the fourth quarter of each year than in other quarters. This reflects increased spending decisions, principally for advertising and research and development activity. Competition In all of their product lines, the Company's subsidiaries compete with companies both locally and globally, throughout the world. Competition exists in all product lines without regard to the number and size of the competing companies involved. Competition in research, involving the development and the improvement of new and existing products and processes, is particularly significant. The development of new and innovative products is important to the Companys success in all areas of its business. This also includes protecting the Companys portfolio of intellectual property. The competitive environment requires substantial investments in continuing research. In addition, the development and maintenance of customer demand for the Companys consumer products involves significant expenditures for advertising and promotion. Research and Development Research activities represent a significant part of the Companys businesses. Research and development expenditures relate to the processes of discovering, testing and developing new products, improving existing products, as well as demonstrating product efficacy and regulatory compliance prior to launch. The Company remains committed to investing in research and development with the aim of delivering high quality and innovative products. Worldwide costs of research and development activities amounted to $8.2 billion, $7.7 billion and $7.5 billion for fiscal years 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively. Major research facilities are located not only in the United States, but also in Belgium, Brazil, Canada, China, France, Germany, India, Israel, Japan, the Netherlands, Singapore, Switzerland and the United Kingdom. Environment The Company is subject to a variety of U.S. and international environmental protection measures. The Company believes that its operations comply in all material respects with applicable environmental laws and regulations. The Companys compliance with these requirements did not during the past year, and is not expected to, have a material effect upon its capital expenditures, cash flows, earnings or competitive position. Regulation Most of the Companys businesses are subject to varying degrees of governmental regulation in the countries in which operations are conducted, and the general trend is toward increasingly stringent regulation. In the United States, the drug, device, diagnostics and cosmetic industries have long been subject to regulation by various federal and state agencies, primarily as to product safety, efficacy, manufacturing, advertising, labeling and safety reporting. The exercise of broad regulatory powers by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (the \"FDA\") continues to result in increases in the amounts of testing and documentation required for FDA clearance of new drugs and devices and a corresponding increase in the expense of product introduction. Similar trends are also evident in major markets outside of the United States. The costs of human health care have been and continue to be a subject of study, investigation and regulation by governmental agencies and legislative bodies around the world. In the United States, attention has been focused on drug prices and profits and programs that encourage doctors to write prescriptions for particular drugs or recommend, use or purchase particular medical devices. Payers have become a more potent force in the market place and increased attention is being paid to drug and medical device pricing, appropriate drug and medical device utilization and the quality and costs of health care generally. Following the U.S. Supreme Court decision in June 2012 upholding the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (the \"ACA\"), there has been an increase in the pace of regulatory issuances by those U.S. government agencies designated to carry out the extensive requirements of the ACA. These have both positive and negative impacts on the U.S. healthcare industry with much remaining uncertain as to how various provisions of the ACA will ultimately affect the industry. The regulatory agencies under whose purview the Company operates have administrative powers that may subject it to actions such as product withdrawals, recalls, seizure of products and other civil and criminal sanctions. In some cases, the Companys subsidiaries may deem it advisable to initiate product recalls. In addition, business practices in the health care industry have come under increased scrutiny, particularly in the United States, by government agencies and state attorneys general, and resulting investigations and prosecutions carry the risk of significant civil and criminal penalties.

Research facilities are also discussed in Item 1 under Business  Research and Development. The Company's subsidiaries generally seek to own their manufacturing facilities, although some, principally in locations abroad, are leased. Office and warehouse facilities are often leased. The Company is committed to maintaining all of its properties in good operating condition and repair, and the facilities are well utilized. McNEIL-PPC, Inc. continues to operate under a consent decree, signed in 2011 with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), which governs certain McNeil Consumer Healthcare manufacturing operations. McNeil continues to operate the manufacturing facilities in Las Piedras, Puerto Rico and Lancaster, Pennsylvania and has made significant progress, having met the remediation commitments at those facilities. The Company also successfully reintroduced many products previously made in Fort Washington, Pennsylvania, from other sites. Plants operating under the consent decree will continue to produce a simplified portfolio focused on key brands. The Fort Washington manufacturing site is not in operation at this time and the Company recently made the decision to make further investments in that facility prior to certification. A discussion of this matter can be found under the heading Government Proceedings - McNeil Consumer Healthcare in Note 21 Legal Proceedings under Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Annual Report, filed as Exhibit 13 to this Report on Form 10-K.

LEGAL PROCEEDINGS ##TABLE_END The following information is incorporated by reference: the information set forth in Note 21 Legal Proceedings under Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements of the Annual Report filed as Exhibit 13 to this Report on Form 10-K. In addition, Johnson  Johnson and its subsidiaries are from time to time party to government investigations, inspections or other proceedings relating to environmental matters, including their compliance with applicable environmental laws. In connection with a routine inspection of a subsidiary's manufacturing facility, the California Department of Toxic Substances Control (the \"Department\") has alleged violation of regulations dealing with the handling of certain wastes. The Company believes that adequate defenses to those allegations exist and has reached an agreement in principal with the Department to resolve this matter.

BUSINESS ##TABLE_END General Johnson  Johnson and its subsidiaries (the \"Company\") have approximately 126,500 employees worldwide engaged in the research and development, manufacture and sale of a broad range of products in the health care field. Johnson  Johnson is a holding company, which has more than 265 operating companies conducting business in virtually all countries of the world. The Companys primary focus is products related to human health and well-being. Johnson  Johnson was incorporated in the State of New Jersey in 1887. The Companys structure is based on the principle of decentralized management. The Executive Committee of Johnson  Johnson is the principal management group responsible for the strategic operations and allocation of the resources of the Company. This Committee oversees and coordinates the activities of the Consumer, Pharmaceutical and Medical Devices (previously referred to as Medical Devices and Diagnostics) business segments. Within the strategic parameters provided by the Committee, senior management groups at U.S. and international operating companies are each responsible for their own strategic plans, as well as the day-to-day operations of those companies, and each subsidiary within the business segments is, with some exceptions, managed by citizens of the country where it is located. Segments of Business The Company is organized into three business segments: Consumer, Pharmaceutical and Medical Devices. Additional information required by this item is incorporated herein by reference to the narrative and tabular descriptions of segments and operating results under the caption Managements Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition and Note 18 Segments of Business and Geographic Areas under Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements of the Annual Report, filed as Exhibit 13 to this Report on Form 10-K. Consumer The Consumer segment includes a broad range of products used in the baby care, oral care, skin care, over-the-counter pharmaceutical, womens health and wound care markets. Baby Care includes the JOHNSONS  Baby line of products. Oral Care includes the LISTERINE  product line. Major brands in Skin Care include the AVEENO  ; CLEAN  CLEAR  ; DABAO  ; JOHNSONS  Adult; LE PETITE MARSEILLAIS  ; LUBRIDERM  ; NEUTROGENA  ; and RoC  product lines. Over-the-counter medicines include the broad family of TYLENOL  acetaminophen products; SUDAFED  cold, flu and allergy products; BENADRYL  and ZYRTEC  allergy products; MOTRIN  IB ibuprofen products; and the PEPCID  line of heartburn products. Major brands in Womens Health outside of North America are STAYFREE  and CAREFREE  sanitary pad and o.b.  tampon brands. Wound Care brands include the BAND-AID  Brand Adhesive Bandages and NEOSPORIN  First Aid product lines. The principal nutritional line is SPLENDA  No Calorie Sweetener. These products are marketed to the general public and sold both to retail outlets and distributors throughout the world. Pharmaceutical The Pharmaceutical segment is focused on five therapeutic areas, including immunology (e.g., rheumatoid arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease, psoriasis and pulmonary diseases), infectious diseases (e.g., HIV, hepatitis, respiratory infections, tuberculosis and vaccines), neuroscience (e.g., Alzheimer's disease, mood disorders, schizophrenia and pain), oncology (e.g., prostate cancer, multiple myeloma, hematologic malignancies and lung cancer), and cardiovascular and metabolic diseases (e.g., thrombosis and diabetes). Products in this segment are distributed directly to retailers, wholesalers, hospitals and health care professionals for prescription use. Key products in the Pharmaceutical segment include: REMICADE  (infliximab), a treatment for a number of immune-mediated inflammatory diseases; SIMPONI  (golimumab), a subcutaneous treatment for adults with moderate to severe rheumatoid arthritis, active psoriatic arthritis, active ankylosing spondylitis and moderately active to severely active ulcerative colitis; SIMPONI ARIA  (golimumab) an intravenous treatment for adults with moderate to severe rheumatoid arthritis; STELARA  (ustekinumab), a treatment for adults with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis and active psoriatic arthritis; INCIVO  (telaprevir), for the treatment of hepatitis C; OLYSIO  /SOVRIAD  (simeprevir), for combination treatment of chronic hepatitis C in adult patients; PREZISTA  (darunavir), a treatment for HIV/AIDS; EDURANT  (rilpivirine), for the treatment of HIV; CONCERTA  (methylphenidate HCl) extended-release tablets CII, a treatment for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder; INVEGA  (paliperidone) extended-release tablets, for the treatment of schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorder; INVEGA SUSTENNA  /XEPLION  (paliperidone palmitate), for the treatment of schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorder in adults; RISPERDAL CONSTA  (risperidone long-acting injection), for the treatment of schizophrenia and the maintenance treatment of Bipolar I Disorder in adults; VELCADE  (bortezomib), a treatment for multiple myeloma; ZYTIGA  (abiraterone acetate), a treatment for metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer; IMBRUVICA  (ibrutinib), an oral, once-daily therapy approved for use in treating certain B-cell malignancies, or blood cancers; PROCRIT  (epoetin alfa, sold outside the U.S. as EPREX  ), to stimulate red blood cell production; XARELTO  (rivaroxaban), an oral anticoagulant for the prevention of deep vein thrombosis (DVT), which may lead to pulmonary embolism (PE) in patients undergoing hip or knee replacement surgery, to reduce the risk of stroke and systemic embolism in patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation, for the treatment of DVT and PE, and for the reduction in the risk of recurrence of DVT and PE; and INVOKANA  (canagliflozin), for the treatment of adults with type 2 diabetes. Many of these products were developed in collaboration with strategic partners or are licensed from other companies. Medical Devices The Medical Devices (previously referred to as Medical Devices and Diagnostics) segment includes a broad range of products used in the orthopaedic, surgical care, specialty surgery, cardiovascular care, diagnostics, diabetes care, and vision care markets, which are distributed to wholesalers, hospitals and retailers, and used principally in the professional fields by physicians, nurses, hospitals, and clinics. These include orthopaedic, trauma and neurological products; general surgery, biosurgical and energy products; products to treat cardiovascular disease; infection prevention products; diagnostics products; blood glucose monitoring and insulin delivery products; and disposable contact lenses. The Company completed the divestiture of its Ortho-Clinical Diagnostics business in June 2014. Geographic Areas The business of Johnson  Johnson is conducted by more than 265 operating companies located in 60 countries, including the U.S., which conduct business in virtually all countries throughout the world. The products made and sold in the international business include many of those described above under - Segments of Business - Consumer, - Pharmaceutical and - Medical Devices. However, the principal markets, products and methods of distribution in the international business vary with the country and the culture. The products sold in international business include not only those developed in the United States, but also those developed by subsidiaries abroad. Investments and activities in some countries outside the U.S. are subject to higher risks than comparable U.S. activities because the investment and commercial climate may be influenced by financial instability in international economies, restrictive economic policies and political and legal system uncertainties. Raw Materials Raw materials essential to the Company's business are generally readily available from multiple sources. Where there are exceptions, the temporary unavailability of those raw materials would not likely have a material adverse effect on the financial results of the Company. Patents The Company's subsidiaries have made a practice of obtaining patent protection on their products and processes where possible. They own or are licensed under a number of patents relating to their products and manufacturing processes, which in the aggregate are believed to be of material importance to the Company in the operation of its businesses. Sales of the Companys largest product, REMICADE  (infliximab), accounted for approximately 9.2% of the Company's total revenues for fiscal 2014. Accordingly, the patents related to this product are believed to be material to the Company. There are two sets of patents related to REMICADE  (infliximab). The first set of patents is co-owned by Janssen Biotech, Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of Johnson  Johnson, and NYU Langone Medical Center (NYU). Janssen Biotech, Inc. has an exclusive license to NYU's interests in the patents. Patents have been granted in the United States, certain countries in the European Union (certain of these patents have been extended by Supplementary Patent Certificates), and Australia.  In the United States, the latest patent expires in September 2018. The patent expired in Canada in March 2012. In certain countries in Europe the patent was extended to February 2015 (Germany, Spain, United Kingdom, Sweden, Austria, Belgium, Switzerland, Denmark, France,  Greece, Italy, Luxembourg and the Netherlands). In Australia, the patent expires in August 2015.  In the United States, the patent expiring in 2018 is subject to reexamination proceedings instituted by a third party. Those proceedings are on-going. The second set of patents related to REMICADE  was granted to the Kennedy Institute of Rheumatology in the United Kingdom in Europe, Canada, Australia and the United States. Janssen Biotech, Inc. has licenses (exclusive for human anti-TNF antibodies and semi-exclusive for non-human anti-TNF antibodies) to these patents that expire in 2017 outside of the United States and 2018 in the United States. The validity of these patents has been  challenged. Certain claims have been invalidated and others are under review in various patent offices around the world and are also subject to litigation in Canada. The Company does not expect that any additional extensions will be available for the patents related to REMICADE  . Loss of exclusivity will likely result in a reduction in sales as biosimilar versions of REMICADE  are introduced to the market. For legal matters regarding the patents related to REMICADE   , see Note 21 Legal Proceedings under Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements of the Annual Report, filed as Exhibit 13 to this Report on Form 10-K, under the heading Intellectual Property - Pharmaceutical - REMICADE  Related Cases. In addition to competing in the immunology market with REMICADE  , the Company is currently marketing STELARA  (ustekinumab), SIMPONI  (golimumab) and SIMPONI ARIA  (golimumab), next generation immunology products with remaining patent lives of up to nine years. Trademarks The Companys subsidiaries have made a practice of selling their products under trademarks and of obtaining protection for these trademarks by all available means. These trademarks are protected by registration in the United States and other countries where such products are marketed. The Company considers these trademarks in the aggregate to be of material importance in the operation of its businesses. Seasonality Worldwide sales do not reflect any significant degree of seasonality; however, spending has been heavier in the fourth quarter of each year than in other quarters. This reflects increased spending decisions, principally for advertising and research and development activity. Competition In all of their product lines, the Company's subsidiaries compete with companies both locally and globally, throughout the world. Competition exists in all product lines without regard to the number and size of the competing companies involved. Competition in research, both internally and externally sourced, involving the development and the improvement of new and existing products and processes, is particularly significant. The development of new and innovative products is important to the Companys success in all areas of its business. This also includes protecting the Companys portfolio of intellectual property. The competitive environment requires substantial investments in continuing research. In addition, the development and maintenance of customer demand for the Companys consumer products involves significant expenditures for advertising and promotion. Research and Development Research activities represent a significant part of the Companys businesses. Research and development expenditures relate to the processes of discovering, testing and developing new products, improving existing products, as well as demonstrating product efficacy and regulatory compliance prior to launch. The Company remains committed to investing in research and development with the aim of delivering high quality and innovative products. Worldwide costs of research and development activities amounted to $8.5 billion, $8.2 billion and $7.7 billion for fiscal years 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. Major research facilities are located not only in the United States, but also in Belgium, Brazil, Canada, China, France, Germany, India, Israel, Japan, the Netherlands, Singapore, Switzerland and the United Kingdom. Environment The Company is subject to a variety of U.S. and international environmental protection measures. The Company believes that its operations comply in all material respects with applicable environmental laws and regulations. The Companys compliance with these requirements did not during the past year, and is not expected to, have a material effect upon its capital expenditures, cash flows, earnings or competitive position. Regulation Most of the Companys businesses are subject to varying degrees of governmental regulation in the countries in which operations are conducted, and the general trend is toward increasingly stringent regulation. In the U.S., the drug, device, diagnostics and cosmetic industries have long been subject to regulation by various federal and state agencies, primarily as to product safety, efficacy, manufacturing, advertising, labeling and safety reporting. The exercise of broad regulatory powers by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (the \"FDA\") continues to result in increases in the amounts of testing and documentation required for FDA clearance of new drugs and devices and a corresponding increase in the expense of product introduction. Similar trends are also evident in major markets outside of the U.S. The costs of human health care have been and continue to be a subject of study, investigation and regulation by governmental agencies and legislative bodies around the world. In the U.S., attention has been focused on drug prices and profits and programs that encourage doctors to write prescriptions for particular drugs or recommend, use or purchase particular medical devices. Payers have become a more potent force in the market place and increased attention is being paid to drug and medical device pricing, appropriate drug and medical device utilization and the quality and costs of health care generally. Following the U.S. Supreme Court decision in June 2012 upholding the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (the \"ACA\"), there has been an increase in the pace of regulatory issuances by those U.S. government agencies designated to carry out the extensive requirements of the ACA. These have both positive and negative impacts on the U.S. healthcare industry with much remaining uncertain as to how various provisions of the ACA will ultimately affect the industry. The regulatory agencies under whose purview the Company operates have administrative powers that may subject it to actions such as product withdrawals, recalls, seizure of products and other civil and criminal sanctions. In some cases, the Companys subsidiaries may deem it advisable to initiate product recalls. In addition, business practices in the health care industry have come under increased scrutiny, particularly in the United States, by government agencies and state attorneys general, and resulting investigations and prosecutions carry the risk of significant civil and criminal penalties. Further, the Company relies on global supply chains, and production and distribution processes, that are complex, are subject to increasing regulatory requirements that may affect sourcing, supply and pricing of materials used in the Company's products, and which are subject to lengthy regulatory approvals.

The Companys manufacturing operations outside the United States are often conducted in facilities that serve more than one business segment. In 2014, the divestiture of the Ortho-Clinical Diagnostics business resulted in the sale of eight manufacturing facilities, seven in the United States and one in Europe. The locations of the manufacturing facilities by major geographic areas of the world are as follows: ##TABLE_START Geographic Area  Number of Facilities  Square Feet (in thousands) United States   5,892 Europe   7,673 Western Hemisphere, excluding U.S.   3,005 Africa, Asia and Pacific   4,897 Worldwide Total   21,467 ##TABLE_ENDIn addition to the manufacturing facilities discussed above, the Company maintains numerous office and warehouse facilities throughout the world. Research facilities are also discussed in Item 1 under Business  Research and Development. The Company's subsidiaries generally seek to own their manufacturing facilities, although some, principally in non-U.S. locations, are leased. Office and warehouse facilities are often leased. The Company is committed to maintaining all of its properties in good operating condition and repair, and the facilities are well utilized. McNEIL-PPC, Inc. continues to operate under a consent decree, signed in 2011 with the FDA, which governs certain McNeil Consumer Healthcare manufacturing operations (the Consent Decree). The Consent Decree requires McNEIL-PPC to remediate the facilities it operates in Lancaster, Pennsylvania, Fort Washington, Pennsylvania, and Las Piedras, Puerto Rico. The Fort Washington facility, which was voluntarily shut down in April 2010, will remain shut down until a third-party current Good Manufacturing Practices (cGMP) expert certifies that its operations are in compliance with applicable law, and the FDA concurs with the third-party certification. Many products previously made in Fort Washington have been transferred to other manufacturing sites and successfully reintroduced to the market. The Lancaster and Las Piedras facilities continue to manufacture and distribute drugs with third-party oversight. Third-party oversight will cease once the FDA has determined that the facilities appear to be in compliance with applicable law. Each facility operating under the Consent Decree is subject to a five-year audit period by a third-party cGMP expert after the facility has been deemed by the FDA to be in apparent compliance with applicable law. McNeil has successfully completed all requirements contained in the Consent Decree Workplan for the Lancaster and Las Piedras manufacturing sites and has completed the steps required for third-party certification of the Fort Washington plant. In February 2015, the third-party cGMP expert submitted written certification to the FDA for all three manufacturing sites. The timeline for completion of any FDA inspection is within the FDA's discretion.

In connection with a routine inspection of a subsidiary's manufacturing facility, the California Department of Toxic Substances Control alleged violation of regulations dealing with the handling of certain wastes. In the fourth quarter of 2014, the subsidiary entered into a settlement agreement with the State of California and agreed to perform certain remedial actions and pay approximately $400,000 to settle the claim. ##TABLE_START ", "4": " Item 4.

BUSINESS ##TABLE_END General Johnson  Johnson and its subsidiaries (the \"Company\") have approximately 127,100 employees worldwide engaged in the research and development, manufacture and sale of a broad range of products in the health care field. Johnson  Johnson is a holding company, which has more than 250 operating companies conducting business in virtually all countries of the world. The Companys primary focus is products related to human health and well-being. Johnson  Johnson was incorporated in the State of New Jersey in 1887. The Executive Committee of Johnson  Johnson is the principal management group responsible for the strategic operations and allocation of the resources of the Company. This Committee oversees and coordinates the activities of the Company's three business segments: Consumer, Pharmaceutical and Medical Devices. Within the strategic parameters provided by the Committee, senior management groups at U.S. and international operating companies are each responsible for their own strategic plans and the day-to-day operations of those companies. Each subsidiary within the business segments is, with limited exceptions, managed by residents of the country where located. Segments of Business The Company is organized into three business segments: Consumer, Pharmaceutical and Medical Devices. Additional information required by this item is incorporated herein by reference to the narrative and tabular descriptions of segments and operating results under: Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition of this Report; and Note 18 Segments of Business and Geographic Areas of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Report. Consumer The Consumer segment includes a broad range of products used in the baby care, oral care, skin care, over-the-counter pharmaceutical, womens health and wound care markets. Baby Care includes the JOHNSONS  line of products. Oral Care includes the LISTERINE  product line. Major brands in Skin Care include the AVEENO  ; CLEAN  CLEAR  ; DABAO  ; JOHNSONS  Adult; LE PETITE MARSEILLAIS  ; LUBRIDERM  ; NEUTROGENA  ; and RoC  product lines. Over-the-counter medicines include the broad family of TYLENOL  acetaminophen products; SUDAFED  cold, flu and allergy products; BENADRYL  and ZYRTEC  allergy products; MOTRIN  IB ibuprofen products; and the PEPCID  line of heartburn products. Major brands in Womens Health outside of North America are STAYFREE  and CAREFREE  sanitary pads and o.b.  tampon brands. Wound Care brands include the BAND-AID  Brand Adhesive Bandages and NEOSPORIN  First Aid product lines. These products are marketed to the general public and sold both to retail outlets and distributors throughout the world. Pharmaceutical The Pharmaceutical segment is focused on five therapeutic areas: immunology (e.g., rheumatoid arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease and psoriasis), infectious diseases and vaccines (e.g., HIV, hepatitis, respiratory infections and tuberculosis), neuroscience (e.g., Alzheimer's disease, mood disorders and schizophrenia), oncology (e.g., prostate cancer, hematologic malignancies and lung cancer), and cardiovascular and metabolic diseases (e.g., thrombosis and diabetes). Products in this segment are distributed directly to retailers, wholesalers, hospitals and health care professionals for prescription use. Key products in the Pharmaceutical segment include: REMICADE  (infliximab), a treatment for a number of immune-mediated inflammatory diseases; SIMPONI  (golimumab), a subcutaneous treatment for adults with moderate to severe rheumatoid arthritis, active psoriatic arthritis, active ankylosing spondylitis and moderately active to severely active ulcerative colitis; SIMPONI ARIA  (golimumab), an intravenous treatment for adults with moderate to severe rheumatoid arthritis; STELARA  (ustekinumab), a treatment for adults with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis and active psoriatic arthritis, and for adolescents with moderate to severe psoriasis; OLYSIO  /SOVRIAD  (simeprevir), for combination treatment of chronic hepatitis C in adult patients; PREZISTA  (darunavir), EDURANT  (rilpivirine), and PREZCOBIX  /REZOLSTA  (darunavir/cobicistat), antiretroviral medicines for the treatment of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1) in combination with other antiretroviral products; SIRTURO  (bedaquiline), a diarylquinoline antimycobacterial drug indicated as part of combination therapy in adults (18 years) with pulmonary multi-drug resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB); CONCERTA  (methylphenidate HCl) extended-release tablets CII, a treatment for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder; INVEGA  (paliperidone) extended-release tablets, for the treatment of schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorder; INVEGA SUSTENNA  /XEPLION  (paliperidone palmitate), for the treatment of schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorder in adults; INVEGA TRINZA  (paliperidone palmitate), for the treatment of schizophrenia in patients after they have been adequately treated with INVEGA SUSTENNA  for at least four months; RISPERDAL CONSTA  (risperidone long-acting injection), for the treatment of  ##TABLE_START  ##TABLE_END schizophrenia and the maintenance treatment of Bipolar 1 Disorder in adults; VELCADE  (bortezomib), a treatment for multiple myeloma and for use in combination with rituximab, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin and prednisone for the treatment of adult patients with previously untreated mantle cell lymphoma; ZYTIGA  (abiraterone acetate), used in combination with prednisone as a treatment for metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer; IMBRUVICA  (ibrutinib), an oral, once-daily therapy approved for use in treating certain B-cell malignancies, or blood cancers, and Waldenstrm's Macroglobulinemia; DARZALEX TM (daratumumab), for the treatment of double refractory multiple myeloma; YONDELIS  (trabectedin), for the treatment of patients with unresectable or metastatic liposarcoma or leiomyosarcoma who received a prior anthracycline-containing regimen; PROCRIT  (epoetin alfa, sold outside the U.S. as EPREX  ), to stimulate red blood cell production; XARELTO  (rivaroxaban), an oral anticoagulant for the prevention of deep vein thrombosis (DVT), which may lead to pulmonary embolism (PE) in patients undergoing hip or knee replacement surgery, to reduce the risk of stroke and systemic embolism in patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation, for the treatment and reduction of risk of recurrence of DVT and PE; INVOKANA  (canagliflozin), for the treatment of adults with type 2 diabetes; and INVOKAMET  /VOKANAMET  (canagliflozin/metformin HCl), a combination therapy of fixed doses of canagliflozin and metformin hydrochloride for the treatment of adults with type 2 diabetes. Many of these medicines were developed in collaboration with strategic partners or are licensed from other companies and maintain active lifecycle development programs. Medical Devices The Medical Devices segment includes a broad range of products used in the orthopaedic, surgery, cardiovascular, diabetes care and vision care fields. These products are distributed to wholesalers, hospitals and retailers, and used principally in the professional fields by physicians, nurses, hospitals, eye care professionals and clinics. They include orthopaedic products; general surgery, biosurgical, endomechanical and energy products; electrophysiology products to treat cardiovascular disease; sterilization and disinfection products to reduce surgical infection; diabetes care products, such as blood glucose monitoring and insulin delivery products; and disposable contact lenses. Geographic Areas The business of Johnson  Johnson is conducted by more than 250 operating companies located in 60 countries, including the U.S., in virtually all countries throughout the world. The products made and sold in the international business include many of those described above under  Segments of Business  Consumer,  Pharmaceutical and  Medical Devices. However, the principal markets, products and methods of distribution in the international business vary with the country and the culture. The products sold in international business include those developed in the United States and by subsidiaries abroad. Investments and activities in some countries outside the U.S. are subject to higher risks than comparable U.S. activities because the investment and commercial climate may be influenced by financial instability in international economies, restrictive economic policies and political and legal system uncertainties. Raw Materials Raw materials essential to the Company's business are generally readily available from multiple sources. Where there are exceptions, the temporary unavailability of those raw materials would not likely have a material adverse effect on the financial results of the Company. Patents The Company's subsidiaries have made a practice of obtaining patent protection on their products and processes where possible. They own or are licensed under a number of patents relating to their products and manufacturing processes, which in the aggregate are believed to be of material importance to the Company in the operation of its businesses. Sales of the Companys largest product, REMICADE  (infliximab), accounted for approximately 9.4% of the Company's total revenues for fiscal 2015. Accordingly, the patents related to this product are believed to be material to the Company. There are two sets of patents related specifically to REMICADE  (infliximab). The first set of patents is co-owned by Janssen Biotech, Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of Johnson  Johnson, and NYU Langone Medical Center (NYU). Janssen Biotech, Inc. has an exclusive license to NYU's interests in the patents. These patents have expired in all countries outside the United States.  In the United States, the latest of these patents expires in September 2018 and this patent stands rejected and is subject to reexamination proceedings instituted by a third party in the United States Patent and Trademark Office. Those proceedings are on going. The second set of patents specifically related to REMICADE  was granted to The Kennedy Institute of Rheumatology in Europe, Canada, Australia and the United States. Janssen Biotech, Inc. has licenses (exclusive for human anti-TNF antibodies and semi-exclusive for non-human anti-TNF antibodies) to these patents that expire in 2017 outside of the United  ##TABLE_START  ##TABLE_END States and 2018 in the United States. The validity of these patents has been  challenged. Certain claims have been invalidated and others are under review in various patent offices around the world and are also subject to litigation in Canada. The Company does not expect that any additional extensions will be available for the above described patents specifically related to REMICADE  . If any of the REMICADE  related patents discussed above is found to be invalid, any such patent could not be relied upon to prevent the introduction of biosimilar versions of REMICADE  . For a more extensive description of legal matters regarding the patents related to REMICADE  , see Note 21 Legal Proceedings  Intellectual Property  Pharmaceutical  REMICADE  Related Cases of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Report. In addition to competing in the immunology market with REMICADE  , the Company is currently marketing STELARA  (ustekinumab), SIMPONI  (golimumab) and SIMPONI ARIA  (golimumab), next generation immunology products with remaining patent lives of up to eight years. Trademarks The Companys subsidiaries have made a practice of selling their products under trademarks and of obtaining protection for these trademarks by all available means. These trademarks are protected by registration in the United States and other countries where such products are marketed. The Company considers these trademarks in the aggregate to be of material importance in the operation of its businesses. Seasonality Worldwide sales do not reflect any significant degree of seasonality; however, spending has been heavier in the fourth quarter of each year than in other quarters. This reflects increased spending decisions, principally for advertising and research and development activity. Competition In all of their product lines, the Company's subsidiaries compete with companies both locally and globally. Competition exists in all product lines without regard to the number and size of the competing companies involved. Competition in research, both internally and externally sourced, involving the development and the improvement of new and existing products and processes, is particularly significant. The development of new and innovative products, as well as protecting the underlying intellectual property of the Companys product portfolio, is important to the Company's success in all areas of its business. The competitive environment requires substantial investments in continuing research. In addition, the development and maintenance of customer demand for the Companys consumer products involve significant expenditures for advertising and promotion. Research and Development Research activities represent a significant part of the Companys businesses. Research and development expenditures relate to the processes of discovering, testing and developing new products, improving existing products, as well as demonstrating product efficacy and regulatory compliance prior to launch. The Company remains committed to investing in research and development with the aim of delivering high quality and innovative products. Worldwide costs of research and development activities amounted to $9.0 billion, $8.5 billion and $8.2 billion for fiscal years 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. Research facilities are located in the United States, Belgium, Brazil, Canada, China, France, Germany, India, Israel, Japan, the Netherlands, Singapore, Switzerland and the United Kingdom. Environment The Company is subject to a variety of U.S. and international environmental protection measures. The Company believes that its operations comply in all material respects with applicable environmental laws and regulations. The Companys compliance with these requirements did not change during the past year, and is not expected to have a material effect upon its capital expenditures, cash flows, earnings or competitive position. Regulation The Companys businesses are subject to varying degrees of governmental regulation in the countries in which operations are conducted, and the general trend is toward increasingly stringent regulation. In the U.S., the drug, device and cosmetic industries have long been subject to regulation by various federal and state agencies, primarily as to product safety, efficacy, manufacturing, advertising, labeling and safety reporting. The exercise of broad regulatory powers by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (the \"FDA\") continues to result in increases in the amounts of testing and documentation required for  ##TABLE_START  ##TABLE_END FDA approval of new drugs and devices and a corresponding increase in the expense of product introduction. Similar trends are also evident in major markets outside of the U.S. The costs of human health care have been and continue to be a subject of study, investigation and regulation by governmental agencies and legislative bodies around the world. In the U.S., attention has been focused on drug prices and profits and programs that encourage doctors to write prescriptions for particular drugs, or to recommend, use or purchase particular medical devices. Payers have become a more potent force in the market place and increased attention is being paid to drug and medical device pricing, appropriate drug and medical device utilization and the quality and costs of health care generally. U.S. government agencies continue to implement the extensive requirements of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (the \"ACA\"). These have both positive and negative impacts on the U.S. healthcare industry with much remaining uncertain as to how various provisions of the ACA will ultimately affect the industry. The regulatory agencies under whose purview the Company operates have administrative powers that may subject it to actions such as product withdrawals, recalls, seizure of products and other civil and criminal sanctions. In some cases, the Companys subsidiaries may deem it advisable to initiate product recalls. In addition, business practices in the health care industry have come under increased scrutiny, particularly in the United States, by government agencies and state attorneys general, and resulting investigations and prosecutions carry the risk of significant civil and criminal penalties. Further, the Company relies on global supply chains, and production and distribution processes, that are complex, are subject to increasing regulatory requirements that may affect sourcing, supply and pricing of materials used in the Company's products. These processes also are subject to lengthy regulatory approvals. Available Information The Companys main corporate website address is www.jnj.com.

Research facilities are also discussed in Item 1 of this Report under Business  Research and Development. The Company's subsidiaries generally seek to own their manufacturing facilities, although some, principally in non-U.S. locations, are leased. Office and warehouse facilities are often leased. The Company also engages contract manufacturers. The Company is committed to maintaining all of its properties in good operating condition and repair, and the facilities are well utilized. McNEIL-PPC, Inc. (now Johnson  Johnson Consumer Inc.) (McNEIL-PPC) continues to operate under a consent decree, signed in 2011 with the FDA, which governs certain McNeil Consumer Healthcare manufacturing operations, and requires McNEIL-PPC to remediate the facilities it operates in Lancaster, Pennsylvania, Fort Washington, Pennsylvania, and Las Piedras, Puerto Rico (the \"Consent Decree\"). The Fort Washington facility was voluntarily shut down in April 2010, and subsequently many products were transferred to other manufacturing sites and successfully reintroduced to the market. After McNEIL-PPC successfully completed all requirements contained in the Consent Decree Workplans for the Lancaster and Las Piedras manufacturing sites and completed the steps required for third-party certification of the Fort Washington plant, a third-party cGMP expert submitted written certifications to the FDA for all three manufacturing sites. Following FDA inspections in 2015, McNEIL-PPC received notifications from the FDA that all three manufacturing facilities are in conformity with applicable laws and regulations. Commercial production in Fort Washington started as of September 2015. Under the Consent Decree, after receiving notice from the FDA of being in compliance with applicable laws and regulations, each of the three facilities is subject to a five-year audit period by a third-party cGMP expert. Thus, a third-party expert will continue to reassess the sites at various times for at least five years.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION ##TABLE_END Organization and Business Segments Description of the Company and Business Segments Johnson  Johnson and its subsidiaries (the Company) have approximately 127,100 employees worldwide engaged in the research and development, manufacture and sale of a broad range of products in the health care field. The Company conducts business in virtually all countries of the world with the primary focus on products related to human health and well-being. The Company is organized into three business segments: Consumer, Pharmaceutical and Medical Devices. The Consumer segment includes a broad range of products used in the baby care, oral care, skin care, over-the-counter pharmaceutical, womens health and wound care markets. These products are marketed to the general public and sold both to retail outlets and distributors throughout the world. The Pharmaceutical segment is focused on five therapeutic areas, including immunology, infectious diseases, neuroscience, oncology, and cardiovascular and metabolic diseases. Products in this segment are distributed directly to retailers, wholesalers, hospitals and health care professionals for prescription use. The Medical Devices segment includes a broad range of products used in the orthopaedic, surgery, cardiovascular, diabetes care and vision care fields which are distributed to wholesalers, hospitals and retailers, and used principally in the professional fields by physicians, nurses, hospitals, eye care professionals and clinics. The Executive Committee of Johnson  Johnson is the principal management group responsible for the strategic operations and allocation of the resources of the Company. This Committee oversees and coordinates the activities of the Consumer, Pharmaceutical and Medical Devices business segments. In all of its product lines, the Company competes with companies both locally and globally, throughout the world. Competition exists in all product lines without regard to the number and size of the competing companies involved. Competition in research, involving the development and the improvement of new and existing products and processes, is particularly significant. The development of new and innovative products, as well as protecting the underlying intellectual property of the Company's product portfolio, is important to the Companys success in all areas of its business. The competitive environment requires substantial investments in continuing research. In addition, the development and maintenance of customer demand for the Companys consumer products involves significant expenditures for advertising and promotion. Managements Objectives The Company manages within a strategic framework with Our Credo as the foundation. The Company believes that our strategic operating principles: being broadly based in human health care, managing the business for the long term, having a decentralized management approach, and being committed to our people and values, are crucial to successfully meeting the demands of the rapidly evolving markets in which we compete. To this end, management is focused on our long-term strategic growth drivers: creating value through innovation, expanding our global reach with a local focus, excellence in execution and leading with purpose. The Company is broadly based in human health care, and is committed to creating value by developing accessible, high quality, innovative products and services. New products introduced within the past five years accounted for approximately 25% of 2015 sales. In 2015, $9.0 billion, or 12.9% of sales, was invested in research and development, reflecting managements commitment to delivering new and differentiated products and services to meet evolving health care needs and sustain the Companys long-term growth. Our diverse businesses with more than 250 operating companies located in 60 countries are the key drivers of the Companys success. Maintaining the Companys decentralized management approach, while at the same time leveraging the extensive resources of the enterprise, positions the Company well to innovate, execute strategic plans and reach markets globally, as well as address the needs and challenges of the local markets. In order to remain a leader in health care, the Company strives to maintain a purpose-driven organization and is committed to developing global business leaders who can achieve these growth objectives. Businesses are managed for the long-term in order to sustain market leadership positions and enable growth, which provides an enduring source of value to our shareholders. Our Credo unifies all Johnson  Johnson employees in achieving these objectives, and provides a common set of values that serve as the foundation of the Companys responsibilities to patients, consumers and health care professionals, employees, communities and shareholders. The Company believes that these foundational values, its strategic framework and long-term growth drivers, along with its overall mission of improving the quality of life for people around the world, will enable Johnson  Johnson to continue to be a leader in the health care industry.  ##TABLE_START  ##TABLE_END Results of Operations Analysis of Consolidated Sales In 2015, worldwide sales decreased 5.7% to $70.1 billion, compared to increases of 4.2% in 2014 and 6.1% in 2013. These sales changes consisted of the following: ##TABLE_START Sales increase/(decrease) due to:    Volume  1.2 %  6.3  7.6 Price  0.6  (0.2 )  0.1 Currency  (7.5 )  (1.9 )  (1.6 ) Total  (5.7 )%  4.2  6.1 ##TABLE_ENDIn 2015, the introduction of competitive products to the Company's Hepatitis C products, OLYSIO  /SOVRIAD  (simeprevir) and INCIVO  (telaprevir), had a negative impact of 2.7% on the worldwide operational sales growth. In 2015, the impact of acquisitions and divestitures on the worldwide operational sales growth was negative 2.0%. In 2014, sales of the Company's Hepatitis C products, OLYSIO  /SOVRIAD  (simeprevir) and INCIVO  (telaprevir), had a positive impact of 2.8%, and the divestiture of the Ortho-Clinical Diagnostics business had a negative impact of 1.4% on the worldwide operational growth. In 2013, the acquisition of Synthes, Inc., net of the related divestiture, increased worldwide operational growth by 2.5%. Sales by U.S. companies were $35.7 billion in 2015, $34.8 billion in 2014 and $31.9 billion in 2013. This represents increases of 2.6% in 2015, 9.0% in 2014 and 7.0% in 2013. Sales by international companies were $34.4 billion in 2015, $39.5 billion in 2014 and $39.4 billion in 2013. This represents a decrease of 13.1% in 2015, and increases of 0.4% in 2014 and 5.4% in 2013. The five-year compound annual growth rates for worldwide, U.S. and international sales were 2.6%, 3.9% and 1.4%, respectively. The ten-year compound annual growth rates for worldwide, U.S. and international sales were 3.3%, 2.3% and 4.5%, respectively. Sales by companies in Europe experienced a decline of 15.6% as compared to the prior year, including operational growth of 1.1%, offset by a negative currency impact of 16.7%. Sales by companies in the Western Hemisphere (excluding the U.S.) experienced a decline of 15.6% as compared to the prior year, including operational growth of 2.6% offset by a negative currency impact of 18.2%. Sales by companies in the Asia-Pacific, Africa region experienced a decline of 8.1% as compared to the prior year, including operational growth of 0.3% and a negative currency impact of 8.4%. 2015 results benefited from the inclusion of a 53rd week. (See Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for Annual Closing Date details). The Company estimated that the fiscal year 2015 growth rate was enhanced by approximately 1.0%. While the additional week added a few days to sales, it also added a full week's worth of operating costs; therefore, the net earnings impact was negligible. In 2015 and 2014, the Company had one wholesaler distributing products for all three segments that represented approximately 12.5% and 11.0%, respectively, of the total consolidated revenues. In 2013, the Company did not have a customer that represented 10% or more of total consolidated revenues. U.S. Health Care Reform On July 28, 2014, the Internal Revenue Service issued final regulations for the Branded Prescription Drug Fee, an annual non-tax deductible fee imposed on entities engaged in the business of manufacturing or importing branded prescription drugs (covered entities), enacted by Section 9008 of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. The final regulations accelerated the expense recognition criteria for the fee obligation by one year, from the year in which the fee is paid to the year in which the sales used to calculate the fee occur. This change impacted covered entities and resulted in the need for all entities to record an additional expense in 2014 for the fee that would have otherwise been expensed when paid in 2015. The Company accrued an additional $220 million in the fiscal third quarter of 2014 due to this change. The fee associated with this accelerated expense was paid, as scheduled, in 2015 and had no cash impact in 2014.  ##TABLE_START  ##TABLE_END Analysis of Sales by Business Segments Consumer Segment Consumer segment sales in 2015 were $13.5 billion, a decrease of 6.8% from 2014, which included 2.7% operational growth offset by a negative currency impact of 9.5%. U.S. Consumer segment sales were $5.2 billion, an increase of 2.5%. International sales were $8.3 billion, a decrease of 11.9%, which included 2.7% operational growth offset by a negative currency impact of 14.6%. In 2015, divestitures had a negative impact of 1.4% on the worldwide Consumer segment operational growth.

Operational growth was primarily driven by analgesics, upper respiratory, including ZYRTEC  , and digestive health products. McNEIL-PPC, Inc. (now Johnson  Johnson Consumer Inc.) (McNEIL-PPC) continues to operate under a consent decree, signed in 2011 with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), which governs certain McNeil Consumer Healthcare manufacturing operations and requires McNEIL-PPC to remediate the facilities it operates in Lancaster, Pennsylvania; Fort Washington, Pennsylvania; and Las Piedras, Puerto Rico (the Consent Decree). In February 2015, a third-party expert submitted written certification to the FDA for all three manufacturing sites. Following FDA inspections in 2015, McNEIL-PPC received notifications from the FDA that all three manufacturing facilities are in conformity with applicable laws and regulations. Under the Consent Decree, after receiving notice from the FDA of being in compliance with applicable laws and regulations, each of the three facilities is subject to a five-year audit period by a third-party cGMP expert. Thus, a third-party expert will continue to reassess the sites at various times for at least five years. The Skin Care franchise sales of $3.5 billion decreased 6.0% as compared to the prior year, which included 1.3% operational growth and a negative currency impact of 7.3%. Operational growth was primarily due to sales growth of NEUTROGENA  and AVEENO  products partially offset by lower sales in China. The Baby Care franchise sales were $2.0 billion in 2015, a decrease of 8.7% compared to the prior year, which included 1.2% operational growth and a negative currency impact of 9.9%. Operational growth was primarily due to new product launches partially offset by competition in China. The Oral Care franchise sales were $1.6 billion in 2015, a decrease of 4.1% as compared to the prior year, which included 5.2% operational growth and a negative currency impact of 9.3%. Operational growth was driven by increased sales of LISTERINE  products, attributable to geographical expansion of new products and successful marketing campaigns. The Womens Health franchise sales were $1.2 billion in 2015, a decrease of 7.8% as compared to the prior year, which included 7.6% operational growth and a negative currency impact of 15.4%. Operational growth outside the U.S. was driven by new product launches and successful marketing campaigns. The Wound Care/Other franchise sales were $1.2 billion in 2015, a decrease of 18.5% from 2014, primarily due to the SPLENDA  and BENECOL  divestitures. Consumer segment sales in 2014 were $14.5 billion, a decrease of 1.4% from 2013, which included 1.0% operational growth offset by a negative currency impact of 2.4%. U.S. Consumer segment sales were $5.1 billion, a decrease of 1.3%. International sales were $9.4 billion, a decrease of 1.4%, which included 2.3% operational growth offset by a negative currency impact of 3.7%.  ##TABLE_START  ##TABLE_END Pharmaceutical Segment Pharmaceutical segment sales in 2015 were $31.4 billion, a decrease of 2.7% from 2014, which included operational growth of 4.2% offset by a negative currency impact of 6.9%. U.S. sales were $18.3 billion, an increase of 5.2%. International sales were $13.1 billion, a decrease of 12.0%, which included 3.0% operational growth offset by a negative currency impact of 15.0%. The Pharmaceutical segment operational growth was negatively impacted by 6.5% due to the introduction of competitive products to the Company's Hepatitis C products, OLYSIO  /SOVRIAD  (simeprevir) and INCIVO  (telaprevir), and positively impacted by 1.4% due to an adjustment to previous reserve estimates, including Managed Medicaid rebates primarily in the Cardiovascular/Metabolism/Other therapeutic area. In 2015, divestitures had a negative impact of 0.3% on the worldwide Pharmaceutical segment operational growth.

Immunology products growth of 2.1% included operational growth of 6.9% and a negative currency impact of 4.8%. The increased sales of STELARA  (ustekinumab) and SIMPONI  /SIMPONI ARIA  (golimumab) were due to market growth and increased penetration of SIMPONI ARIA  . Growth was partially offset by lower REMICADE  (infliximab) sales  to the Company's distributor primarily due to the weakening of the euro and biosimilar competition in Europe. The patents for REMICADE  in certain countries in Europe expired in February 2015. Biosimilar versions of REMICADE  have been introduced in certain markets outside the United States, resulting in a reduction in sales of REMICADE  in those markets.  ##TABLE_START  ##TABLE_END Additional biosimilar competition will likely result in a further reduction in REMICADE  sales in markets outside the United States. The timing of the possible introduction of a biosimilar version of REMICADE  in the United States is subject to enforcement of patent rights, approval by the FDA and compliance with the 180-day notice provisions of the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act (the BPCIA). On February 9, 2016, the Arthritis Advisory Committee of the FDA recommended by a vote of 21-3 to approve the first investigational biosimilar infliximab across all eligible indications in the United States. There is a risk that a competitor could launch a biosimilar version of REMICADE  following FDA approval (subject to compliance with the 180-day notice provisions of the BPCIA), even though one or more valid patents are in place. Introduction to the U.S. market of a biosimilar version of REMICADE  will result in a reduction in U.S. sales of REMICADE  . In 2015, U.S. sales of REMICADE  were $4.5 billion. The launch of a biosimilar version of REMICADE  in the U.S. is not expected to have a material adverse effect on the Companys results of operations and cash flows in 2016. See Note 21 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for legal matters regarding the REMICADE  patents. Infectious disease products sales were $3.7 billion, a decline of 34.7% from 2014, which included an operational decrease of 27.6% and a negative currency impact of 7.1%. Competitive products to the Company's Hepatitis C products, OLYSIO  /SOVRIAD  (simeprevir) and INCIVO  (telaprevir), had a significant negative impact on U.S. sales and will continue to have a negative impact on future sales. The decline of Hepatitis C sales was partially offset by sales growth of EDURANT  (rilpivirine) and sales of PREZISTA  / PREZCOBIX  /REZOLSTA  (darunavir/cobicistat). Neuroscience products sales were $6.3 billion, a decrease of 3.5% from 2014, which included an operational growth of 5.0% and a negative currency impact of 8.5%. The U.S. sales growth of CONCERTA  /methylphenidate was primarily due to a therapeutic equivalence reclassification of generic competitors by the FDA in November 2014. Strong sales of INVEGA SUSTENNA  /XEPLION  /INVEGA TRINZA  (paliperidone palmitate) were primarily due to increased market share and the launch of INVEGA TRINZA  . Neuroscience products sales were negatively impacted by the U.S. divestiture of NUCYNTA  (tapentadol) and lower sales of RISPERDAL  CONSTA  (risperidone) . Oncology products achieved sales of $4.7 billion in 2015, representing an increase of 5.3% as compared to the prior year. Oncology products growth of 5.3% included operational growth of 17.7% and a negative currency impact of 12.4%. Contributors to the growth were strong sales of IMBRUVICA  (ibrutinib) due to the approval of new indications, additional country launches and strong patient uptake. Additionally, sales of ZYTIGA  (abiraterone acetate) grew in the U.S. due to market growth partially offset by share decline, and strong growth in Asia and Latin America was partially offset by lower sales in Europe due to competition. Cardiovascular/Metabolism/Other products achieved sales of $6.4 billion in 2015, representing an increase of 15.1% as compared to the prior year due to strong sales of XARELTO  (rivaroxaban) and INVOKANA  /INVOKAMET  (canagliflozin). PROCRIT  /EPREX  (Epoetin alfa) sales were impacted by competition.  ##TABLE_START  ##TABLE_END During 2015, the Company advanced its pipeline with several regulatory submissions and approvals for new drugs and additional indications for existing drugs as follows: ##TABLE_START Product Name (Chemical Name) Indication US Approv EU Approv US Filing EU Filing DARZALEX  (daratumumab) For the treatment of double refractory multiple myeloma     EDURANT  (rilpiravine) For use in combination with other anti-retroviral agents, for the treatment-nave adolescent patients aged 12 to 18 years with HIV-1 infection     IMBRUVICA  (ibrutinib) Treatment of Waldenstrm's Macroglobulinemia      Treatment for patients with relapsed or refractory chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) or small lymphocytic lymphoma in combination with bendamustine and rituximab      For use in treatment-nave patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia     INVEGA TRINZA  (paliperidone palmitate) An atypical antipsychotic injection administered four times a year for the treatment of schizophrenia     INVOKAMET  XR (canagliflozin) A once-daily therapy combining fixed doses of canagliflozin and metformin hydrochloride extended release for the treatment of adults with type 2 diabetes     PREZCOBIX  (darunavir/cobicistat) For use in combination with other antiretroviral medicinal products for the treatment of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1)     SIMPONI  (golimumab) Treatment of non-radiographic axial spondyloarthritis     STELARA  (ustekinumab) For the treatment of adolescents with moderate-to-severe psoriasis      For the treatment of adult patients with moderately to severely active Crohn's disease     VELCADE  (bortezomib) For use in combination with rituximab, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin and prednisone for the treatment of adult patients with previously untreated mantle cell lymphoma     YONDELIS  (trabectedin) For the treatment of patients with unresectable or metastatic liposarcoma or leiomyosarcoma     ##TABLE_ENDThe Pharmaceutical segment achieved sales of $32.3 billion in 2014, representing an increase of 14.9% over the prior year, with strong operational growth of 16.5% and a negative currency impact of 1.6%. U.S. sales were $17.4 billion, an increase of 25.0%. International sales were $14.9 billion, an increase of 5.0%, which included 8.3% operational growth and a negative currency impact of 3.3%. In 2013, Pharmaceutical segment sales included a positive adjustment to previous estimates for Managed Medicaid rebates. This negatively impacted 2014 Pharmaceutical operational sales growth by 0.8% as compared to the prior year. In 2014, sales of the Company's Hepatitis C products, OLYSIO  /SOVRIAD  (simeprevir) and INCIVO  (telaprevir), had a positive impact of 6.9% on the operational growth of the Pharmaceutical segment.  ##TABLE_START  ##TABLE_END Medical Devices Segment The Medical Devices segment sales in 2015 were $25.1 billion, a decrease of 8.7% from 2014, which included an operational decline of 1.4% and a negative currency impact of 7.3%. U.S. sales were $12.1 billion, a decrease of 1.0% as compared to the prior year. International sales were $13.0 billion, a decrease of 14.8% as compared to the prior year, with an operational decrease of 1.7% and a negative currency impact of 13.1%. The divestitures of the Ortho-Clinical Diagnostics and the Cordis Businesses had a negative impact of 3.2% and 0.6%, respectively, on the worldwide operational growth of the Medical Devices segment as compared to 2014.

The Orthopaedics franchise sales were $9.3 billion in 2015, a decrease of 4.3% from 2014, which included operational growth of 1.7% and a negative currency impact of 6.0%. Operational growth in the U.S. and Europe regions was primarily driven by sales of the hip primary stem platform, the ATTUNE  Knee System, trauma TFNA nailing system and sports medicine ORTHOVISC  /MONOVISC  products. Growth was negatively impacted by softer demand and a reduction in customer inventory levels primarily in China and continued pricing pressures. The Surgery franchise sales were $9.2 billion in 2015, a decrease of 5.1% from 2014, which included operational growth of 2.7% and a negative currency impact of 7.8%. Operational growth in Advanced Surgery was driven by endocutter, biosurgical and energy products, primarily attributable to market growth, increased penetration in certain markets and new product launches. Operational growth in Specialty Surgery was primarily driven by Mentor products. Growth was partially offset by lower sales of women's health and urology products in General Surgery. The Vision Care franchise sales were $2.6 billion in 2015, a decrease of 7.5% from 2014, which included operational growth of 1.7% and a negative currency impact of 9.2%. Operational growth in all the major regions was primarily driven by new product launches partially offset by lower price. The Cardiovascular franchise sales were $2.0 billion, a decrease of 7.8% from 2014, which represented an operational decline of 0.1% and a negative currency impact of 7.7%. Strong operational growth in the electrophysiology business was driven by market growth and the success of the THERMOCOOL  SMARTTOUCH   Catheter and was offset by the impact of divesting the Cordis business. The Company completed the divestiture of the Cordis business to Cardinal Health on October 4, 2015. The Cordis business generated annual net revenues of approximately $535 million and $780 million in 2015 and 2014, respectively. For additional details see Note 20 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The Diabetes Care franchise sales were $1.9 billion, a decrease of 10.0% from 2014, which represented an operational decline of 0.7% and a negative currency impact of 9.3%. The operational decline was primarily due to lower price partially offset by the success of the ANIMAS  VIBE  products. On June 30, 2014, the Company divested the Ortho-Clinical Diagnostics business (the Diagnostics Franchise) to The Carlyle Group. For additional details see Note 20 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.  ##TABLE_START  ##TABLE_END The Medical Devices segment sales in 2014 were $27.5 billion, a decrease of 3.4% from 2013, which included an operational decline of 1.6% and a negative currency impact of 1.8%. U.S. sales were $12.3 billion, a decrease of 4.3% as compared to the prior year. International sales were $15.3 billion, a decline of 2.7% as compared to the prior year, with operational growth of 0.5% offset by a negative currency impact of 3.2%. In 2014, the divestiture of the Ortho-Clinical Diagnostics business had a negative impact of 3.2% on the operational growth of the Medical Devices segment. Analysis of Consolidated Earnings Before Provision for Taxes on Income Consolidated earnings before provision for taxes on income decreased to $19.2 billion as compared to $20.6 billion in 2014, a decrease of 6.6%. The decrease was primarily attributable to significantly lower sales of OLYSIO  /SOVRIAD  (simeprevir), negative currency impacts, a restructuring charge of $0.6 billion and higher intangible asset write-downs of $0.1 billion in 2015 as compared to 2014. The decrease was partially offset by lower net litigation expense of $1.1 billion, lower Synthes integration costs of $0.6 billion, a positive adjustment of $0.4 billion to previous reserve estimates including Managed Medicaid rebates, and higher gains of $0.3 billion from divestitures as compared to the prior year. The fiscal year 2015 included higher gains of $0.3 billion primarily from the divestitures of the Cordis business, the SPLENDA  brand and the U.S. divestiture of NUCYNTA  versus the gains recorded in 2014 from the divestitures of the Ortho-Clinical Diagnostics business and the K-Y  brand. Additionally, 2014 included an additional year of the Branded Prescription Drug Fee of $0.2 billion. Consolidated earnings before provision for taxes on income increased to $20.6 billion in 2014 as compared to $15.5 billion in 2013, an increase of 32.9%. Earnings before provision for taxes on income were favorable due to strong sales volume growth, particularly sales of OLYSIO  /SOVRIAD  (simeprevir), positive mix from higher sales of higher margin products in the Pharmaceutical business, divestitures of lower margin businesses and cost reduction efforts across many of the businesses. Additionally, 2014 included higher net gains on divestitures of $2.3 billion, primarily the divestiture of the Ortho-Clinical Diagnostics business, lower litigation expense of $1.0 billion, lower in-process research and development costs of $0.4 billion and lower expenses of $0.1 billion related to the DePuy ASR Hip program as compared to the fiscal year 2013. This was partially offset by the inclusion of an additional year of the Branded Prescription Drug Fee of $0.2 billion and $0.1 billion of higher Synthes integration/transaction costs in 2014. The fiscal year 2013 included a net gain of $0.4 billion on equity investment transactions, primarily the sale of Elan American Depositary Shares. As a percent to sales, consolidated earnings before provision for taxes on income in 2015 was 27.4% versus 27.7% in 2014. Cost of Products Sold and Selling, Marketing and Administrative Expenses: Cost of products sold and selling, marketing and administrative expenses as a percent to sales were as follows: ##TABLE_START % of Sales    Cost of products sold  30.7 %  30.6  31.3 Percent point increase/(decrease) over the prior year  0.1  (0.7 )  (0.9 ) Selling, marketing and administrative expenses  30.3 %  29.5  30.6 Percent point increase/(decrease) over the prior year  0.8  (1.1 )  (0.4 ) ##TABLE_ENDIn 2015, cost of products sold as a percent to sales increased slightly as compared to the prior year. Favorable mix between the segments was offset by $81 million associated with the restructuring activity in the Medical Devices segment, negative transactional currency and lower sales of OLYSIO  /SOVRIAD  (simeprevir) in 2015. Intangible asset amortization expense included in cost of products sold for 2015 and 2014 was $1.2 billion and $1.4 billion, respectively. There was an increase in the percent to sales of selling, marketing and administrative expenses in 2015 compared to the prior year, primarily due to incremental investment spending in all the segments and the impact from lower sales of OLYSIO  /SOVRIAD  (simeprevir), partially offset by favorable mix and the inclusion of an additional year of the Branded Prescription Drug Fee of $0.2 billion in 2014. In 2014, cost of products sold as a percent to sales decreased compared to the prior year. This was primarily the result of  positive mix from higher sales of higher margin products in the Pharmaceutical business, divestitures of lower margin businesses and cost improvements across many of the businesses. This was partially offset by pricing and the impact of negative transactional currency. In addition, 2013 included an inventory step-up charge of $0.1 billion related to the Synthes acquisition. Intangible asset amortization expense included in cost of products sold for both 2014 and 2013 was $1.4 billion. There was a decrease in the percent to sales of selling, marketing and administrative expenses in 2014 compared to the prior year primarily due to leveraged costs resulting from growth in the Pharmaceutical business, particularly sales of OLYSIO  /SOVRIAD  (simeprevir), and cost containment initiatives across many of the businesses. This was partially offset by the inclusion of an additional year of the Branded Prescription Drug Fee of $220 million in the fiscal third quarter of 2014.   ##TABLE_START  ##TABLE_END Research and Development Expense: Research and development expense by segment of business was as follows: ##TABLE_START     (Dollars in Millions)  Amount  % of Sales*  Amount  % of Sales*  Amount  % of Sales* Consumer  $  4.6 %   4.3   4.0 Pharmaceutical  6,821  21.7  6,213  19.2  5,810  20.7 Medical Devices  1,600  6.4  1,652  6.0  1,783  6.3 Total research and development expense  $ 9,046  12.9 %  8,494  11.4  8,183  11.5 Percent increase/(decrease) over the prior year  6.5 %    3.8    6.8   ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START * As a percent to segment sales ##TABLE_ENDResearch and development activities represent a significant part of the Company's business. These expenditures relate to the processes of discovering, testing and developing new products, upfront payments and milestones, improving existing products, as well as ensuring product efficacy and regulatory compliance prior to launch. The Company remains committed to investing in research and development with the aim of delivering high quality and innovative products. In 2015, worldwide costs of research and development activities increased by 6.5% compared to 2014. The increase as a percent to sales was attributable to increased investment spending primarily in the Pharmaceutical segment, lower overall sales and business mix. In 2014, worldwide costs of research and development activities increased by 3.8% compared to 2013. The reduction as a percent to sales was primarily due to strong sales growth in the Pharmaceutical business. Research spending in the Pharmaceutical segment increased in absolute dollars to $6.2 billion as compared to $5.8 billion primarily due to higher levels of spending to advance the Company's Pharmaceutical pipeline. In-Process Research and Development (IPRD): In 2015, the Company recorded an IPRD charge of $0.2 billion primarily for the discontinuation of certain development projects related to Covagen. In 2014, the Company recorded an IPRD charge of $0.2 billion for the impairment of various IPRD projects related to RespiVert, Crucell, Mentor and Synthes for the delay or discontinuation of certain development projects. In 2013,  the Company recorded an IPRD charge of $0.6 billion primarily for the impairment of various IPRD projects related to Crucell, CorImmun and Acclarent for the delay or discontinuation of certain development projects. Other (Income) Expense, Net: Other (income) expense, net is the account where the Company records gains and losses related to the sale and write-down of certain investments in equity securities held by Johnson  Johnson Innovation - JJDC, Inc. (formerly Johnson  Johnson Development Corporation), gains and losses on divestitures, transactional currency gains and losses, acquisition-related costs, litigation accruals and settlements, as well as royalty income. The change in other (income) expense, net for the fiscal year 2015 was a favorable change of $2.0 billion as compared to the prior year primarily due to lower litigation expense of $1.1 billion, lower Synthes integration costs of $0.6 billion and higher JJDC portfolio gains of $0.2 billion as compared to the prior year. Additionally, the fiscal year 2015 included higher gains of $0.3 billion primarily from the divestitures of the Cordis business, the SPLENDA  brand and the U.S. divestiture of NUCYNTA  versus the gains recorded in 2014 from the divestitures of the Ortho-Clinical Diagnostics business and the K-Y  brand. This was partially offset by higher intangible asset write-downs of $0.1 billion in 2015. The change in other (income) expense, net for the fiscal year 2014 was a favorable change of $2.6 billion as compared to the prior year. The fiscal year 2014 included higher net gains on divestitures of $2.3 billion, primarily the divestiture of the Ortho-Clinical Diagnostics business, lower litigation expense of $1.0 billion and lower costs of $0.1 billion related to the DePuy ASR  Hip program as compared to 2013. This was partially offset by higher Synthes integration/transaction costs of $0.2 billion and higher intangible asset write-downs of $0.1 billion primarily related to INCIVO  (telaprevir) in 2014. Additionally, the fiscal year 2013 included a higher net gain of $0.5 billion as compared to 2014 on equity investment transactions, primarily the sale of Elan American Depositary Shares. Interest (Income) Expense: Interest income in 2015 increased by $61 million as compared to 2014 due to a higher average balance of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities and higher interest rates. Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaled $38.4 billion at the end of 2015, and averaged $35.7 billion as compared to the $31.1 billion average cash balance in 2014. The increase in the year-end cash balance was primarily due to cash generated from operating activities. Interest expense in 2015 increased slightly as compared to 2014. The average debt balance was $19.3 billion in 2015 versus $18.5 billion in 2014. The total debt balance at the end of 2015 was $19.9 billion as compared to $18.8 billion at the end of 2014. The higher debt balance of approximately $1.1 billion was an increase in commercial paper for general corporate purposes, primarily the stock repurchase program. Interest income in 2014 was comparable to the prior year. A higher balance in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities was offset by lower interest rates. Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaled $33.1 billion at the end of  ##TABLE_START  ##TABLE_END 2014, and averaged $31.1 billion as compared to the $25.2 billion average cash balance in 2013. The increase in the year-end cash balance was primarily due to cash generated from operating activities. Interest expense in 2014 increased by $51 million as compared to 2013 due to a higher average debt balance. The average debt balance was $18.5 billion in 2014 versus $17.2 billion in 2013. The total debt balance at the end of 2014 was $18.8 billion as compared to $18.2 billion at the end of 2013. The higher debt balance of approximately $0.6 billion was due to increased borrowings in November 2014. The Company increased borrowings, capitalizing on favorable terms in the capital markets. The proceeds of the borrowings were used for general corporate purposes. Income Before Tax by Segment Income before tax by segment of business were as follows: ##TABLE_START       Percent of Segment Sales (Dollars in Millions)     Consumer  $ 1,787  1,941  13.2 %  13.4 Pharmaceutical  11,734  11,696  37.3  36.2 Medical Devices  6,826  7,953  27.2  28.9 Total (1)  20,347  21,590  29.0  29.0 Less: Expenses not allocated to segments (2)  1,151  1,027     Earnings before provision for taxes on income  $ 19,196  20,563  27.4 %  27.7 ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (1)  See Note 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more details. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (2)  Amounts not allocated to segments include interest (income) expense, noncontrolling interests, and general corporate (income) expense. ##TABLE_END Consumer Segment: In 2015, the Consumer segment income before tax as a percent to sales was 13.2%, versus 13.4% in 2014, primarily due to lower divestiture gains in 2015 versus 2014. In 2015, the Consumer segment tax included a gain of $0.3 billion from divestitures, primarily the divestiture of the SPLENDA  brand. In 2014, the Consumer segment included a gain of $0.5 billion from divestitures, primarily the divestiture of the K-Y  brand. In 2014, the Consumer segment income before tax as a percent to sales was 13.4%, flat to the prior year. Pharmaceutical Segment: In 2015, the Pharmaceutical segment income before tax as a percent to sales was 37.3% versus 36.2% in 2014. The favorable income before tax was primarily due to higher gains recognized in 2015 partially offset by a sales decline of OLYSIO  /SOVRIAD  (simeprevir), increased investment spending and negative currency impacts as compared to 2014. Included in 2015 was a gain of $1.0 billion on the U.S. divestiture of NUCYNTA  , as well as receipt of a contingent payment and a positive adjustment to previous reserve estimates, including Managed Medicaid rebates. Additionally, the Pharmaceutical segment income before tax in 2014 was negatively impacted by $0.2 billion for an additional year of the Branded Prescription Drug Fee and higher intangible asset amortization expense of $0.3 billion primarily related to the write-down of INCIVO  (telaprevir). In 2014, the Pharmaceutical segment income before tax as a percent to sales was 36.2% versus 32.6% in 2013. The favorable income before tax was attributable to strong sales volume growth, particularly sales of OLYSIO  /SOVRIAD  (simeprevir), positive sales mix of higher margin products and cost containment initiatives realized in selling, marketing and administrative expenses. This was partially offset by $0.2 billion for an additional year of the Branded Prescription Drug Fee and a $0.1 billion intangible asset write-down related to INCIVO  (telaprevir). Additionally, 2013 included a net gain of $0.4 billion on equity investment transactions, primarily the sale of Elan American Depositary Shares, and a positive adjustment of $0.2 billion to previous estimates for Managed Medicaid rebates, partially offset by higher write-downs of $0.4 billion for the impairment of IPRD as compared to 2014. Medical Devices Segment: In 2015, the Medical Devices segment income before tax as a percent to sales was 27.2% versus 28.9% in 2014 primarily due to a restructuring charge of $0.6 billion, an intangible asset write-down of $0.3 billion related to Acclarent, and lower gains of $0.5 billion on divestitures as compared to 2014. In 2015, the Medical Devices segment included gains of $1.4 billion, primarily for the divestiture of the Cordis business versus a gain of $1.9 billion recorded in 2014 for the divestiture of the Ortho-Clinical Diagnostics business. The 2015 income before tax was favorably impacted by lower net litigation expense of $0.9 billion, which included a gain from the litigation settlement agreement of $0.6 billion with Guidant, and lower Synthes integration costs of $0.6 billion in 2015 as compared to 2014.  ##TABLE_START  ##TABLE_END In 2014, Medical Devices segment income before tax as a percent to sales was 28.9% versus 18.5% in 2013. The favorable income before tax was attributable to the net gain of $1.9 billion on the divestiture of the Ortho-Clinical Diagnostics business in 2014 and lower litigation expense of $1.1 billion as compared to 2013. Restructuring: The Company announced restructuring actions in its Medical Devices segment that are expected to result in annualized pre-tax cost savings of $800 million to $1.0 billion, the majority of which is expected to be realized by the end of 2018, including approximately $200 million savings in 2016. The savings will provide the Company with added flexibility and resources to fund investment in new growth opportunities and innovative solutions for customers and patients. The Company estimates that, in connection with its plans, it will record pre-tax restructuring charges of approximately $2.0 billion to $2.4 billion, most of which are expected to be incurred by 2017. In the fiscal fourth quarter of 2015, the Company recorded a pre-tax charge of $0.6 billion, of which $81 million is included in cost of products sold. See Note 22 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional details related to the restructuring. Provision for Taxes on Income: The worldwide effective income tax rate was 19.7% in 2015 , 20.6% in 2014 and 10.6% in 2013 . The 2015 effective tax rate decrease of 0.9% as compared to 2014 was primarily attributable to the increases in taxable income in lower tax jurisdictions relative to higher tax jurisdictions and a tax benefit resulting from a restructuring of international affiliates. Additionally, the 2014 effective tax rate was affected by the items mentioned below. The increase in the 2014 effective tax rate, as compared to 2013, was attributable to the following: the divestiture of the Ortho-Clinical Diagnostics business at an approximate 44% effective tax rate, litigation accruals at low tax rates, the mix of earnings into higher tax jurisdictions, primarily the U.S., the accrual of an additional year of the Branded Prescription Drug Fee, which is not tax deductible, and additional U.S. tax expense related to a planned increase in dividends from current year foreign earnings as compared to the prior year. These increases to the 2014 effective tax rate were partially offset by a tax benefit of $0.4 billion associated with the Conor Medsystems divestiture. The 2014 effective tax rate was also reduced as the Company adjusted its unrecognized tax benefits as a result of (i) the federal appeals courts decision in OMJ Pharmaceuticals, Inc.s litigation regarding credits under former Section 936 of the Internal Revenue Code (see Note 21 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information), and (ii) a settlement of substantially all issues related to the Companys U.S. Internal Revenue Service audit of tax years 2006 - 2009. The 2013 effective tax rate was reduced by a tax benefit associated with the write-off of assets for tax purposes associated with Scios, Inc., and the inclusion of both the 2013 and 2012 benefit from the Research and Development tax credit and the Controlled Foreign Corporation look-through provisions, because those provisions were enacted into law in January 2013 and were retroactive to January 1, 2012. Liquidity and Capital Resources Liquidity  Cash Flows Cash and cash equivalents were $13.7 billion at the end of 2015 as compared to $14.5 billion at the end of 2014. The primary sources and uses of cash that contributed to the $0.8 billion decrease were approximately $19.3 billion of cash generated from operating activities offset by $7.7 billion net cash used by investing activities, and $10.8 billion net cash used by financing activities, and $1.5 billion due to the effect on exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents. In addition, the Company had $24.6 billion in marketable securities at the end of 2015 and $18.6 billion at the end of 2014. See Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional details on cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities. Cash flow from operations of $19.3 billion was the result of $15.4 billion of net earnings and $5.4 billion of non-cash charges and other adjustments for depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation and assets write-downs, primarily related to Acclarent and Venezuela write-downs, reduced by $2.6 billion from net gains on sale of assets/businesses, and $1.2 billion related to deferred taxes, accounts receivable and inventories. Additional sources of operating cash flow of $2.2 billion resulted from a decrease in other current and non-current assets and an increase in other current and non-current liabilities. Investing activities use of $7.7 billion was primarily for net purchases of investments in marketable securities of $6.7 billion, additions to property, plant and equipment of $3.5 billion, and acquisitions, net of cash acquired of $1.0 billion, partially offset by $3.5 billion of proceeds from the disposal of assets/businesses. Financing activities use of $10.8 billion was primarily for dividends to shareholders of $8.2 billion and $5.3 billion for the repurchase of common stock. Financing activities also included a source of $1.4 billion from net proceeds of short and long-term debt and $1.3 billion of net proceeds from stock options exercised and associated tax benefits. On October 13, 2015, the Company announced that its Board of Directors approved a share repurchase program, authorizing the Company to purchase up to $10.0 billion of the Company's shares of common stock. As of January 3, 2016, $1.0 billion has been repurchased under the program. The repurchase program has no time limit and may be suspended for periods or discontinued at any time. Any shares acquired will be available for general corporate purposes. The Company intends to finance the share repurchase program through available cash and access to the capital markets. The previous share repurchase program approved on July 21, 2014, authorizing the Company to purchase up to $5.0 billion of the Company's shares of common stock, was completed on April 28, 2015.  ##TABLE_START  ##TABLE_END In 2015, the Company continued to have access to liquidity through the commercial paper market. The Company has a shelf registration with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission that enables the Company to issue debt securities and warrants to purchase debt securities on a timely basis. For additional details on borrowings, see Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The Company anticipates that operating cash flows, existing credit facilities and access to the capital markets will provide sufficient resources to fund operating needs in 2016. Concentration of Credit Risk Global concentration of credit risk with respect to trade accounts receivables continues to be limited due to the large number of customers globally and adherence to internal credit policies and credit limits. Economic challenges in Italy, Spain, Greece and Portugal (the Southern European Region) have impacted certain payment patterns, which have historically been longer than those experienced in the U.S. and other international markets. The total net trade accounts receivable balance in the Southern European Region was approximately $1.3 billion as of January 3, 2016 and $1.8 billion as of December 28, 2014. Approximately $0.8 billion as of January 3, 2016 and approximately $1.1 billion as of December 28, 2014 of the Southern European Region net trade accounts receivable balance related to the Company's Consumer, Vision Care and Diabetes Care businesses as well as certain Pharmaceutical and Medical Devices customers which are in line with historical collection patterns. The remaining balance of net trade accounts receivable in the Southern European Region has been negatively impacted by the timing of payments from certain government owned or supported health care customers, as well as certain distributors of the Pharmaceutical and Medical Devices local affiliates. The total net trade accounts receivable balance for these customers were approximately $0.5 billion at January 3, 2016 and $0.7 billion at December 28, 2014. The Company continues to receive payments from these customers and, in some cases, late payments with interest. For customers where payment is expected over periods of time longer than one year, revenue and trade receivables have been discounted over the estimated period of time for collection. Allowances for doubtful accounts have been increased for these customers, but have been immaterial to date. The Company will continue to work closely with these customers on payment plans, monitor the economic situation and take appropriate actions as necessary. Financing and Market Risk The Company uses financial instruments to manage the impact of foreign exchange rate changes on cash flows. Accordingly, the Company enters into forward foreign exchange contracts to protect the value of certain foreign currency assets and liabilities and to hedge future foreign currency transactions primarily related to product costs. Gains or losses on these contracts are offset by the gains or losses on the underlying transactions. A 10% appreciation of the U.S. Dollar from the January 3, 2016 market rates would increase the unrealized value of the Companys forward contracts by $15 million. Conversely, a 10% depreciation of the U.S. Dollar from the January 3, 2016 market rates would decrease the unrealized value of the Companys forward contracts by $18 million. In either scenario, the gain or loss on the forward contract would be offset by the gain or loss on the underlying transaction, and therefore, would have no impact on future anticipated earnings and cash flows. The Company hedges the exposure to fluctuations in currency exchange rates, and the effect on certain assets and liabilities in foreign currency, by entering into currency swap contracts. A 1% change in the spread between U.S. and foreign interest rates on the Companys interest rate sensitive financial instruments would either increase or decrease the unrealized value of the Companys swap contracts by approximately $115 million. In either scenario, at maturity, the gain or loss on the swap contract would be offset by the gain or loss on the underlying transaction, and therefore, would have no impact on future anticipated cash flows. The Company does not enter into financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes. Further, the Company has a policy of only entering into contracts with parties that have at least an investment grade credit rating. The counter-parties to these contracts are major financial institutions and there is no significant concentration of exposure with any one counter-party. Management believes the risk of loss is remote. The Company invests in both fixed rate and floating rate interest earning securities which carry a degree of interest rate risk. The fair market value of fixed rate securities may be adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates, while floating rate securities may produce less income than predicted if interest rates fall. A 1% (100 basis points) change in spread on the Companys interest rate sensitive investments would either increase or decrease the unrealized value of cash equivalents and current marketable securities by approximately $314 million. The Company has access to substantial sources of funds at numerous banks worldwide. In September 2015, the Company secured a new 364-day Credit Facility. Total credit available to the Company approximates $10 billion, which expires on September 15, 2016. Interest charged on borrowings under the credit line agreement is based on either bids provided by banks, the prime rate or London Interbank Offered Rates (LIBOR), plus applicable margins. Commitment fees under the agreement are not material. Total borrowings at the end of 2015 and 2014 were $19.9 billion and $18.8 billion, respectively. The increase in borrowings between 2015 and 2014 was a result of financing for the Company's share repurchase program. In 2015, net cash  ##TABLE_START  ##TABLE_END (cash and current marketable securities, net of debt) was $18.5 billion compared to net cash of $14.3 billion in 2014. Total debt represented 21.8% of total capital (shareholders equity and total debt) in 2015 and 21.2% of total capital in 2014. Shareholders equity per share at the end of 2015 was $25.82 compared to $25.06 at year-end 2014 , an increase of 3.0%. A summary of borrowings can be found in Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Contractual Obligations and Commitments The Companys contractual obligations are primarily for leases, debt and unfunded retirement plans. There are no other significant obligations. To satisfy these obligations, the Company will use cash from operations. The following table summarizes the Companys contractual obligations and their aggregate maturities as of January 3, 2016 (see Notes 7, 10 and 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further details): ##TABLE_START (Dollars in Millions)  Debt Obligations  Interest on Debt Obligations  Unfunded Retirement Plans  Operating Leases  Total  $ 2,104     2,990  1,790     2,615  1,501     2,209  1,587     2,211      1,223 After 2020  7,296  4,303    12,267 Total  $ 14,961  6,752    23,515 ##TABLE_ENDFor tax matters, see Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Dividends The Company increased its dividend in 2015 for the 53rd consecutive year. Cash dividends paid were $2.95 per share in 2015 compared with dividends of $2.76 per share in 2014 , and $2.59 per share in 2013 . The dividends were distributed as follows: ##TABLE_START    First quarter $ 0.70  0.66  0.61 Second quarter 0.75  0.70  0.66 Third quarter 0.75  0.70  0.66 Fourth quarter 0.75  0.70  0.66 Total $ 2.95  2.76  2.59 ##TABLE_ENDOn January 4, 2016, the Board of Directors declared a regular quarterly cash dividend of $0.75 per share, payable on March 8, 2016, to shareholders of record as of February 23, 2016. The Company expects to continue the practice of paying regular cash dividends. Other Information Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Managements discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition are based on the Companys consolidated financial statements that have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. (GAAP). The preparation of these financial statements requires that management make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported for revenues, expenses, assets, liabilities and other related disclosures. Actual results may or may not differ from these estimates. The Company believes that the understanding of certain key accounting policies and estimates are essential in achieving more insight into the Companys operating results and financial condition. These key accounting policies include revenue recognition, income taxes, legal and self-insurance contingencies, valuation of long-lived assets, assumptions used to determine the amounts recorded for pensions and other employee benefit plans and accounting for stock based awards. Revenue Recognition: The Company recognizes revenue from product sales when goods are shipped or delivered, and title and risk of loss pass to the customer. Provisions for certain rebates, sales incentives, trade promotions, coupons, product returns and discounts to customers are accounted for as reductions in sales in the same period the related sales are recorded.  ##TABLE_START  ##TABLE_END Product discounts granted are based on the terms of arrangements with direct, indirect and other market participants, as well as market conditions, including prices charged by competitors. Rebates, which include the Medicaid rebate provision, are estimated based on contractual terms, historical experience, patient outcomes, trend analysis and projected market conditions in the various markets served. The Company evaluates market conditions for products or groups of products primarily through the analysis of wholesaler and other third-party sell-through and market research data, as well as internally generated information. Sales returns are estimated and recorded based on historical sales and returns information. Products that exhibit unusual sales or return patterns due to dating, competition or other marketing matters are specifically investigated and analyzed as part of the accounting for sales return accruals. Sales returns allowances represent a reserve for products that may be returned due to expiration, destruction in the field, or in specific areas, product recall. The returns reserve is based on historical return trends by product and by market as a percent to gross sales. In accordance with the Companys accounting policies, the Company generally issues credit to customers for returned goods. The Companys sales returns reserves are accounted for in accordance with the U.S. GAAP guidance for revenue recognition when right of return exists. Sales returns reserves are recorded at full sales value. Sales returns in the Consumer and Pharmaceutical segments are almost exclusively not resalable. Sales returns for certain franchises in the Medical Devices segment are typically resalable but are not material. The Company infrequently exchanges products from inventory for returned products. The sales returns reserve for the total Company has been approximately 1.0% of annual net trade sales during the fiscal reporting years 2015 , 2014 and 2013 . Promotional programs, such as product listing allowances and cooperative advertising arrangements, are recorded in the year incurred. Continuing promotional programs include coupons and volume-based sales incentive programs. The redemption cost of consumer coupons is based on historical redemption experience by product and value. Volume-based incentive programs are based on estimated sales volumes for the incentive period and are recorded as products are sold. The Company also earns service revenue for co-promotion of certain products. For all years presented, service revenues were less than 1% of total revenues and are included in sales to customers. These arrangements are evaluated to determine the appropriate amounts to be deferred or recorded as a reduction of revenue. In addition, the Company enters into collaboration arrangements that contain multiple revenue generating activities. Amounts due from collaborative partners for these arrangements are recognized as each activity is performed or delivered, based on the relative fair value. Upfront fees received as part of these arrangements are deferred and recognized over the performance period. See Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional disclosures on collaborations. Reasonably likely changes to assumptions used to calculate the accruals for rebates, returns and promotions are not anticipated to have a material effect on the financial statements. The Company currently discloses the impact of changes to assumptions in the quarterly or annual filing in which there is a material financial statement impact.  ##TABLE_START  ##TABLE_END Below are tables that show the progression of accrued rebates, returns, promotions, reserve for doubtful accounts and reserve for cash discounts by segment of business for the fiscal years ended January 3, 2016 and December 28, 2014 .

The Company estimates deferred tax assets and liabilities based on enacted tax regulations and rates. Future changes in tax laws and rates may affect recorded deferred tax assets and liabilities. The Company has unrecognized tax benefits for uncertain tax positions. The Company follows U.S. GAAP, which prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. Management believes that changes in these estimates would not have a material effect on the Company's results of operations, cash flows or financial position. At January 3, 2016 and December 28, 2014 , the cumulative amounts of undistributed international earnings were approximately $58.0 billion and $53.4 billion, respectively. At January 3, 2016 and December 28, 2014 , the Company's foreign subsidiaries held balances of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities in the amounts of $38.2 billion and $32.9 billion, respectively. The Company has not provided deferred taxes on the undistributed earnings from certain international subsidiaries where the earnings are considered to be permanently reinvested. The Company intends to continue to reinvest these earnings in international operations. If the Company decided at a later date to repatriate these earnings to the U.S., the Company would be required to provide for the net tax effects on these amounts. The Company does not determine the deferred tax liability associated with these undistributed earnings, as such determination is not practical. See Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding income taxes. Legal and Self Insurance Contingencies:  The Company records accruals for various contingencies, including legal proceedings and product liability claims as these arise in the normal course of business. The accruals are based on managements judgment as to the probability of losses and, where applicable, actuarially determined estimates. The Company has self insurance through a wholly-owned captive insurance company. In addition to accruals in the self insurance program, claims that exceed the insurance coverage are accrued when losses are probable and amounts can be reasonably estimated. Additionally, the Company records insurance receivable amounts from third-party insurers when recovery is probable. As appropriate, reserves against these receivables are recorded for estimated amounts that may not be collected from third-party insurers. The Company follows the provisions of U.S. GAAP when recording litigation related contingencies. A liability is recorded when a loss is probable and can be reasonably estimated. The best estimate of a loss within a range is accrued; however, if no estimate in the range is better than any other, the minimum amount is accrued.  ##TABLE_START  ##TABLE_END See Notes 1 and 21 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding product liability and legal proceedings. Long-Lived and Intangible Assets: The Company assesses changes in economic conditions and makes assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows in evaluating the value of the Companys property, plant and equipment, goodwill and intangible assets. As these assumptions and estimates may change over time, it may or may not be necessary for the Company to record impairment charges. Employee Benefit Plans: The Company sponsors various retirement and pension plans, including defined benefit, defined contribution and termination indemnity plans, which cover most employees worldwide. These plans are based on assumptions for the discount rate, expected return on plan assets, mortality rates, expected salary increases, health care cost trend rates and attrition rates. See Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further details on these rates and the effect a rate change to the health care cost trend would have on the Companys results of operations. Stock Based Compensation: The Company recognizes compensation expense associated with the issuance of equity instruments to employees for their services. Based on the type of equity instrument, the fair value is estimated on the date of grant using either the Black-Scholes option valuation model or a combination of both the Black-Scholes option valuation model and Monte Carlo valuation model, and is expensed in the financial statements over the service period. The input assumptions used in determining fair value are the expected life, expected volatility, risk-free rate and expected dividend yield. For performance share units the fair market value is calculated for each of the three component goals at the date of grant. The fair values for the sales and earnings per share goals of each performance share unit were estimated on the date of grant using the fair market value of the shares at the time of the award, discounted for dividends, which are not paid on the performance share units during the vesting period. The fair value for the relative total shareholder return goal of each performance share unit was estimated on the date of grant using the Monte Carlo valuation model. See Note 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. New Accounting Pronouncements Refer to Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for recently adopted accounting pronouncements and recently issued accounting pronouncements not yet adopted as of January 3, 2016 . Economic and Market Factors The Company is aware that its products are used in an environment where, for more than a decade, policymakers, consumers and businesses have expressed concerns about the rising cost of health care. In response to these concerns, the Company has a long-standing policy of pricing products responsibly. For the period 2005 - 2015, in the United States, the weighted average compound annual growth rate of the Companys net price increases for health care products (prescription and over-the-counter drugs, hospital and professional products) was below the U.S. Consumer Price Index (CPI). The Company operates in certain countries where the economic conditions continue to present significant challenges. The Company continues to monitor these situations and take appropriate actions. Inflation rates continue to have an effect on worldwide economies and, consequently, on the way companies operate. The Company has accounted for operations in Venezuela as highly inflationary, as the prior three-year cumulative inflation rate surpassed 100%. In the face of increasing costs, the Company strives to maintain its profit margins through cost reduction programs, productivity improvements and periodic price increases. The Venezuelan government has established alternative systems and offerings of various foreign currency exchanges. During 2015, the Company primarily utilized the official government rate of 6.3 Bolivares Fuertes to one U.S. Dollar in preparing its consolidated financial statements. During 2014, the Company applied to settle an outstanding dividend payable at one of the alternative foreign exchange rates. As a result, the Company has applied this alternative exchange rate to translate certain transactions, as appropriate. Through the fourth quarter of 2015, the number of the Companys transactions conducted at the official rate declined from prior quarters. As a result, the Company determined that it was no longer likely that all outstanding net monetary assets would be settled at the official government rate of 6.3 Bolivares Fuertes to one U.S. Dollar. Therefore, the Company recorded a charge of $161 million to revalue its net monetary assets in Venezuela at one of the governments alternative exchange rates (SIMADI) and impair its non-monetary assets. After the revaluation, as of January 3, 2016, the Companys Venezuelan subsidiaries represented less than 0.1% of the Company's consolidated assets and liabilities. Due to continuing uncertain economic conditions in Venezuela, it is possible that additional charges may be recorded in the future. Any additional charges are not expected to have a material adverse effect on the Companys 2016 full year results. While the Company continues to do business in Greece, the Company closely monitors the economic situation. As of January 3, 2016, the Companys Greek subsidiaries represented 0.3% and 0.4% of the Company's consolidated assets and revenues, respectively. The Company is exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates. A 1% change in the value of the U.S. Dollar as compared to all foreign currencies in which the Company had sales, income or expense in 2015 would have increased or decreased the translation of foreign sales by approximately $340 million and income by $90 million.  ##TABLE_START  ##TABLE_END The Company faces various worldwide health care changes that may continue to result in pricing pressures that include health care cost containment and government legislation relating to sales, promotions and reimbursement of health care products. Changes in the behavior and spending patterns of purchasers of health care products and services, including delaying medical procedures, rationing prescription medications, reducing the frequency of physician visits and foregoing health care insurance coverage, as a result of the current global economic downturn, may continue to impact the Companys businesses. The Company also operates in an environment increasingly hostile to intellectual property rights. Firms have filed Abbreviated New Drug Applications or Biosimilar Biological Product Applications with the FDA or otherwise challenged the coverage and/or validity of the Company's patents, seeking to market generic or biosimilar forms of many of the Companys key pharmaceutical products prior to expiration of the applicable patents covering those products. In the event the Company is not successful in defending the patent claims challenged in the resulting lawsuits, generic or biosimilar versions of the products at issue will be introduced to the market, resulting in the potential for substantial market share and revenue losses for those products, and which may result in a non-cash impairment charge in any associated intangible asset. There is also a risk that one or more competitors could launch a generic or biosimilar version of the product at issue following regulatory approval even though one or more valid patents are in place. For further information, see the discussion on REMICADE  Related Cases and Litigation Against Filers of Abbreviated New Drug Applications in Note 21 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Legal Proceedings Johnson  Johnson and certain of its subsidiaries are involved in various lawsuits and claims regarding product liability, intellectual property, commercial and other matters; governmental investigations; and other legal proceedings that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of business. The Company records accruals for loss contingencies associated with these legal matters when it is probable that a liability will be incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. The Company has accrued for certain litigation matters and continues to monitor each related legal issue and adjust accruals for new information and further developments in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 450-20-25. For these and other litigation and regulatory matters currently disclosed for which a loss is probable or reasonably possible, the Company is unable to estimate the possible loss or range of loss beyond the amounts already accrued. Amounts accrued for legal contingencies often result from a complex series of judgments about future events and uncertainties that rely heavily on estimates and assumptions. The ability to make such estimates and judgments can be affected by various factors, including whether damages sought in the proceedings are unsubstantiated or indeterminate; scientific and legal discovery has not commenced or is not complete; proceedings are in early stages; matters present legal uncertainties; there are significant facts in dispute; or there are numerous parties involved. In the Company's opinion, based on its examination of these matters, its experience to date and discussions with counsel, the ultimate outcome of legal proceedings, net of liabilities accrued in the Company's balance sheet, is not expected to have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial position. However, the resolution of, or increase in accruals for, one or more of these matters in any reporting period may have a material adverse effect on the Company's results of operations and cash flows for that period. See Note 21 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding legal proceedings.

Forward-looking statements do not relate strictly to historical or current facts and anticipate results based on managements plans that are subject to uncertainty. Forward-looking statements may be identified by the use of words such as plans, expects, will, anticipates, estimates and other words of similar meaning in conjunction with, among other things, discussions of future operations, financial performance, the Companys strategy for growth, product development, regulatory approval, market position and expenditures. Forward-looking statements are based on current expectations of future events. The Company cannot guarantee that any forward-looking statement will be accurate, although the Company believes that it has been reasonable in its expectations and assumptions. Investors should realize that if underlying assumptions prove inaccurate or that known or unknown risks or uncertainties materialize, actual results could vary materially from the Companys expectations and projections. Investors are therefore cautioned not to place undue reliance on any forward-looking statements. The Company does not undertake to update any forward-looking statements as a result of new information or future events or developments. Risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to: economic factors, such as interest rate and currency exchange rate fluctuations; competition, including technological advances, new products and patents attained by competitors; challenges and uncertainties inherent in new product development, including uncertainty of clinical success and obtaining regulatory approvals; uncertainty of commercial success of new and existing products; challenges to patents; the impact of patent expirations; the ability of the company to successfully execute strategic plans, including restructuring plans; the potential that the expected benefits and opportunities related to the restructuring may not be realized or may take longer to realize than expected; significant adverse litigation or government action, including related to product liability claims; impact of business combinations and divestitures; market conditions and the possibility that the on-going share repurchase program may be suspended or discontinued; significant changes in customer relationships or changes in behavior and spending patterns or financial distress of purchasers of health care products and services; changes to applicable laws and regulations, including global health care reforms; trends toward health care cost containment; increased scrutiny of the health care industry by government agencies; financial instability of international economies and legal systems and sovereign risk; manufacturing difficulties or delays, internally or within the supply chain; complex global supply chains with increasing regulatory requirements; product efficacy or safety concerns resulting in product recalls or regulatory action; disruptions due to natural disasters; and the potential failure to meet obligations in compliance agreements with government bodies. A discussion of these and other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from expectations can be found in this Report for the fiscal year ended January 3, 2016 , including in Exhibit 99. The Company notes these factors as permitted by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.  ##TABLE_START  ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START ", "7A": " Item 7A.

New Accounting Pronouncements Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements During the fiscal second quarter of 2015, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standard Update 2015-04: Practical Expedient for the Measurement Date of an Employers Defined Benefit Obligation and Plan Assets. This update provides a practical expedient option to entities that have defined benefit plans and have a fiscal year-end that does not coincide with a calendar month-end. This option allows an entity to elect to measure defined benefit plan assets and obligations using the calendar month-end that is closest to its fiscal year-end. This update will be effective for the Company for all annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2015 and if the practical expedient is elected by an entity, it is required to be adopted on a prospective basis. Early adoption is permitted. The Company has elected to adopt the practical expedient to measure its defined benefit plans. This election did not have a material impact on the Companys consolidated financial statements. During the fiscal fourth quarter of 2015, the FASB issued Accounting Standard Update 2015-17 Income Taxes: Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes. To simplify the presentation of deferred income taxes, the amendments in this update require that deferred tax liabilities and assets be classified as noncurrent in a classified statement of financial position. This update is required to be effective for all public Companies for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within those annual periods. Earlier application is permitted. The Company has elected to early adopt this standard on a retrospective basis. The 2014 Consolidated Balance Sheet reclassification reduced current assets by $3.6 billion , increased non-current assets by $2.8 billion and reduced liabilities by $0.8 billion . Recently Issued Accounting Standards Not Adopted as of January 3, 2016 During the fiscal first quarter of 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standard Update 2016-01: Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities. The amendments in this update supersede the guidance to classify equity securities with readily determinable fair values into different categories (that is, trading or available-for-sale) and require equity securities to be measured at fair value with changes in the fair value recognized through net income. The standard amends financial reporting by providing relevant information about an entitys equity investments and reducing the number of items that are recognized in other comprehensive income. This update will be effective for the Company for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods within those annual periods. The Company is currently assessing the impact of the future adoption of this standard on its financial statements. During the fiscal second quarter of 2015, the FASB issued Accounting Standard Update 2015-03: Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs. This update requires capitalized debt issuance costs to be presented as a reduction to the carrying value of debt instead of being classified as a deferred charge, as currently required. This update will be effective for the Company for all annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2015 and is required to be applied retroactively for all periods presented. This update will not have a material impact on the presentation of the Companys financial position.  ##TABLE_START  ##TABLE_END During the fiscal second quarter of 2015, the FASB issued Accounting Standard Update 2015-11: Simplifying the Measurement of Inventory. This update requires inventory to be measured at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Net realizable value is the estimated selling prices in the ordinary course of business, less reasonably predictable costs of completion, disposal and transportation. This update will be effective for the Company for all annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2016. The amendments in this update should be applied prospectively with earlier application permitted as of the beginning of an interim or annual reporting period. This update will not have a material impact on the presentation of the Companys financial position. During the fiscal third quarter of 2015, the FASB issued Accounting Standard Update 2015-16 Business Combinations: Simplifying the Accounting for Measurement-Period Adjustments. The amendments in this update require that an acquirer recognize adjustments to provisional amounts that are identified during the measurement period in the reporting period in which the adjustment amounts are determined. This update will be effective for the Company for all annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2015. The amendments in this update should be applied prospectively to adjustments to provisional amounts that occur after the effective date of this update with earlier application permitted for financial statements that have not been issued. This update is not expected to have a material impact on the Companys consolidated financial statements. During the fiscal second quarter of 2014, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update 2014-09: Revenue from Contracts with Customers. This standard replaces substantially all current revenue recognition accounting guidance. During the fiscal third quarter of 2015, the FASB approved a one year deferral to the effective date to be adopted by all public companies for all annual periods and interim reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017. Early adoption of this standard is permitted but not before the original effective date for all annual periods and interim reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016. The Company is currently assessing the impact of the future adoption of this standard on its financial statements. During the fiscal second quarter of 2014, the FASB issued amended guidance Accounting Standards Update No. 2014-10: Development Stage Entities: Elimination of Certain Financial Reporting Requirements, Including an Amendment to Variable Interest Entity Guidance in Topic 810, Consolidation. The change in the current guidance will require the Company to determine if it should consolidate one of these entities based on the change in the consolidation analysis. This update to the consolidation analysis will become effective for all annual periods and interim reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2015. The adoption of this standard is not expected to have a material impact on the presentation of the Company's consolidated financial statements. During the fiscal third quarter of 2014, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2014-15: Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entitys Ability to Continue as a Going Concern. This standard requires management to evaluate, for each annual and interim reporting period, whether there are conditions and events, considered in the aggregate, that raise substantial doubt about an entitys ability to continue as a going concern within one year after the date the financial statements are issued or are available to be issued. If substantial doubt is raised, additional disclosures around managements plan to alleviate these doubts are required. This update will become effective for all annual periods and interim reporting periods ending after December 15, 2016. This standard is not expected to have any impact on current disclosures in the financial statements. Cash Equivalents The Company classifies all highly liquid investments with stated maturities of three months or less from date of purchase as cash equivalents and all highly liquid investments with stated maturities of greater than three months from the date of purchase as current marketable securities. The Company has a policy of making investments only with commercial institutions that have at least an investment grade credit rating. The Company invests its cash primarily in reverse repurchase agreements (RRAs), government securities and obligations, corporate debt securities and money market funds. RRAs are collateralized by deposits in the form of Government Securities and Obligations for an amount not less than 102% of their value. The Company does not record an asset or liability as the Company is not permitted to sell or repledge the associated collateral. The Company has a policy that the collateral has at least an A (or equivalent) credit rating. The Company utilizes a third party custodian to manage the exchange of funds and ensure that collateral received is maintained at 102% of the value of the RRAs on a daily basis. RRAs with stated maturities of greater than three months from the date of purchase are classified as marketable securities.  ##TABLE_START  ##TABLE_END Investments Investments classified as held to maturity investments are reported at amortized cost and realized gains or losses are reported in earnings. Investments classified as available-for-sale are carried at estimated fair value with unrealized gains and losses recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income. Available-for-sale securities available for current operations are classified as current assets. Management determines the appropriate classification of its investment in debt and equity securities at the time of purchase and re-evaluates such determination at each balance sheet date. The Company periodically reviews its investments in equity securities for impairment and adjusts these investments to their fair value when a decline in market value is deemed to be other than temporary. If losses on these securities are considered to be other than temporary, the loss is recognized in earnings. Property, Plant and Equipment and Depreciation Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost. The Company utilizes the straight-line method of depreciation over the estimated useful lives of the assets: ##TABLE_START Building and building equipment 20 - 30 years Land and leasehold improvements 10 - 20 years Machinery and equipment 2 - 13 years ##TABLE_ENDThe Company capitalizes certain computer software and development costs, included in machinery and equipment, when incurred in connection with developing or obtaining computer software for internal use. Capitalized software costs are amortized over the estimated useful lives of the software, which generally range from 3 to 8 years. The Company reviews long-lived assets to assess recoverability using undiscounted cash flows. When certain events or changes in operating or economic conditions occur, an impairment assessment may be performed on the recoverability of the carrying value of these assets. If the asset is determined to be impaired, the loss is measured based on the difference between the assets fair value and its carrying value. If quoted market prices are not available, the Company will estimate fair value using a discounted value of estimated future cash flows. Revenue Recognition The Company recognizes revenue from product sales when the goods are shipped or delivered and title and risk of loss pass to the customer. Provisions for certain rebates, sales incentives, trade promotions, coupons, product returns and discounts to customers are accounted for as reductions in sales in the same period the related sales are recorded. Product discounts granted are based on the terms of arrangements with direct, indirect and other market participants, as well as market conditions, including prices charged by competitors. Rebates, which include Medicaid, are estimated based on contractual terms, historical experience, patient outcomes, trend analysis and projected market conditions in the various markets served. The Company evaluates market conditions for products or groups of products primarily through the analysis of wholesaler and other third-party sell-through and market research data, as well as internally generated information. Sales returns are generally estimated and recorded based on historical sales and returns information. Products that exhibit unusual sales or return patterns due to dating, competition or other marketing matters are specifically investigated and analyzed as part of the accounting for sales returns accruals. Sales returns allowances represent a reserve for products that may be returned due to expiration, destruction in the field, or in specific areas, product recall. The returns reserve is based on historical return trends by product and by market as a percent to gross sales. In accordance with the Companys accounting policies, the Company generally issues credit to customers for returned goods. The Companys sales returns reserves are accounted for in accordance with U.S. GAAP guidance for revenue recognition when right of return exists. Sales returns reserves are recorded at full sales value. Sales returns in the Consumer and Pharmaceutical segments are almost exclusively not resalable. Sales returns for certain franchises in the Medical Devices segment are typically resalable but are not material. The Company infrequently exchanges products from inventory for returned products. The sales returns reserve for the total Company has been approximately 1.0% of annual sales to customers during the fiscal reporting years 2015 , 2014 and 2013 . Promotional programs, such as product listing allowances and cooperative advertising arrangements, are recorded in the year incurred. Continuing promotional programs include coupons and volume-based sales incentive programs. The redemption cost of consumer coupons is based on historical redemption experience by product and value. Volume-based incentive programs are based on the estimated sales volumes for the incentive period and are recorded as products are sold. The Company also earns service revenue for co-promotion of certain products and includes it in sales to customers. These arrangements are evaluated to determine the appropriate amounts to be deferred or recorded as a reduction of revenue.  ##TABLE_START  ##TABLE_END Shipping and Handling Shipping and handling costs incurred were $996 million , $1,068 million and $1,128 million in 2015 , 2014 and 2013 , respectively, and are included in selling, marketing and administrative expense. The amount of revenue received for shipping and handling is less than 0.5% of sales to customers for all periods presented. Inventories Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market determined by the first-in, first-out method. Intangible Assets and Goodwill The authoritative literature on U.S. GAAP requires that goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives be assessed annually for impairment. The Company completed the annual impairment test for 2015 in the fiscal fourth quarter. Future impairment tests will be performed annually in the fiscal fourth quarter, or sooner if warranted. Purchased in-process research and development is accounted for as an indefinite lived intangible asset until the underlying project is completed, at which point the intangible asset will be accounted for as a definite lived intangible asset, or abandoned, at which point the intangible asset will be written off or partially impaired. Intangible assets that have finite useful lives continue to be amortized over their useful lives, and are reviewed for impairment when warranted by economic conditions. See Note 5 for further details on Intangible Assets and Goodwill. Financial Instruments As required by U.S. GAAP, all derivative instruments are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value. Fair value is the exit price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability. Fair value is a market-based measurement determined using assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability. The authoritative literature establishes a three-level hierarchy to prioritize the inputs used in measuring fair value, with Level 1 having the highest priority and Level 3 having the lowest. Changes in the fair value of derivatives are recorded each period in current earnings or other comprehensive income, depending on whether the derivative is designated as part of a hedge transaction, and if so, the type of hedge transaction. The Company documents all relationships between hedged items and derivatives. The overall risk management strategy includes reasons for undertaking hedge transactions and entering into derivatives. The objectives of this strategy are: (1) minimize foreign currency exposures impact on the Companys financial performance; (2) protect the Companys cash flow from adverse movements in foreign exchange rates; (3) ensure the appropriateness of financial instruments; and (4) manage the enterprise risk associated with financial institutions. See Note 6 for additional information on Financial Instruments. Product Liability Accruals for product liability claims are recorded, on an undiscounted basis, when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the liability can be reasonably estimated based on existing information and actuarially determined estimates where applicable. The accruals are adjusted periodically as additional information becomes available. The Company accrues an estimate of the legal defense costs needed to defend each matter when those costs are probable and can be reasonably estimated. As a result of cost and availability factors, effective November 1, 2005, the Company ceased purchasing third-party product liability insurance. The Company has self insurance through a wholly-owned captive insurance company. In addition to accruals in the self insurance program, claims that exceed the insurance coverage are accrued when losses are probable and amounts can be reasonably estimated. Based on the availability of prior coverage, receivables for insurance recoveries related to product liability claims are recorded on an undiscounted basis, when it is probable that a recovery will be realized. As appropriate, reserves against these receivables are recorded for estimated amounts that may not be collected from third-party insurers. Concentration of Credit Risk Global concentration of credit risk with respect to trade accounts receivables continues to be limited due to the large number of customers globally and adherence to internal credit policies and credit limits. Economic challenges in Italy, Spain, Greece and Portugal (the Southern European Region) have impacted certain payment patterns, which have historically been longer than those experienced in the U.S. and other international markets. The total net trade accounts receivable balance in the Southern European Region was approximately $1.3 billion as of January 3, 2016 and approximately $1.8 billion as of December 28, 2014 . Approximately $0.8 billion as of January 3, 2016 and approximately $1.1 billion as of December 28, 2014 of the Southern European Region net trade accounts receivable balance related to the Company's Consumer, Vision Care and Diabetes Care businesses as well as certain Pharmaceutical and Medical Devices customers which are in line with historical collection patterns. The remaining balance of net trade accounts receivable in the Southern European Region has been negatively impacted by the timing of payments from certain government owned or supported health care customers, as well as certain distributors of the Pharmaceutical and Medical Devices local affiliates. The total net trade accounts receivable balance for these customers  ##TABLE_START  ##TABLE_END were approximately $0.5 billion at January 3, 2016 and $0.7 billion at December 28, 2014 . The Company continues to receive payments from these customers and, in some cases, late payments with interest. For customers where payment is expected over periods of time longer than one year, revenue and trade receivables have been discounted over the estimated period of time for collection. Allowances for doubtful accounts have been increased for these customers, but have been immaterial to date. The Company will continue to work closely with these customers on payment plans, monitor the economic situation and take appropriate actions as necessary. Research and Development Research and development expenses are expensed as incurred. Upfront and milestone payments made to third parties in connection with research and development collaborations are expensed as incurred up to the point of regulatory approval. Payments made to third parties subsequent to regulatory approval are capitalized and amortized over the remaining useful life of the related product. Amounts capitalized for such payments are included in other intangibles, net of accumulated amortization. The Company enters into collaborative arrangements, typically with other pharmaceutical or biotechnology companies, to develop and commercialize drug candidates or intellectual property. These arrangements typically involve two (or more) parties who are active participants in the collaboration and are exposed to significant risks and rewards dependent on the commercial success of the activities. These collaborations usually involve various activities by one or more parties, including research and development, marketing and selling and distribution. Often, these collaborations require upfront, milestone and royalty or profit share payments, contingent upon the occurrence of certain future events linked to the success of the asset in development. Amounts due from collaborative partners related to development activities are generally reflected as a reduction of research and development expense because the performance of contract development services is not central to the Companys operations. In general, the income statement presentation for these collaborations is as follows: ##TABLE_START Nature/Type of Collaboration  Statement of Earnings Presentation Third-party sale of product  Sales to customers Royalties/milestones paid to collaborative partner (post-regulatory approval)*  Cost of products sold Royalties received from collaborative partner  Other income (expense), net Upfront payments  milestones paid to collaborative partner (pre-regulatory approval)  Research and development expense Research and development payments to collaborative partner  Research and development expense Research and development payments received from collaborative partner  Reduction of Research and development expense ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START * Milestones are capitalized as intangible assets and amortized to cost of goods sold over the useful life. ##TABLE_ENDFor all years presented, there was no individual project that represented greater than 5% of the total annual consolidated research and development expense. The Company has a number of products and compounds developed in collaboration with strategic partners including XARELTO  , co-developed with Bayer HealthCare AG and IMBRUVICA  , developed in collaboration and co-marketed with Pharmacyclics LLC, an AbbVie company.  Advertising Costs associated with advertising are expensed in the year incurred and are included in selling, marketing and administrative expenses. Advertising expenses worldwide, which comprised television, radio, print media and Internet advertising, were $2.5 billion , $2.6 billion and $2.5 billion in 2015 , 2014 and 2013 , respectively.  ##TABLE_START  ##TABLE_END Income Taxes Income taxes are recorded based on amounts refundable or payable for the current year and include the results of any difference between U.S. GAAP accounting and tax reporting, recorded as deferred tax assets or liabilities. The Company estimates deferred tax assets and liabilities based on enacted tax regulations and rates. Future changes in tax laws and rates may affect recorded deferred tax assets and liabilities in the future. The Company has unrecognized tax benefits for uncertain tax positions. The Company follows U.S. GAAP which prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. Management believes that changes in these estimates would not have a material effect on the Company's results of operations, cash flows or financial position. At January 3, 2016 and December 28, 2014 , the cumulative amounts of undistributed international earnings were approximately $58.0 billion and $53.4 billion , respectively. At January 3, 2016 and December 28, 2014 , the Company's foreign subsidiaries held balances of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities in the amounts of $38.2 billion and $32.9 billion , respectively. The Company has not provided deferred taxes on the undistributed earnings from certain international subsidiaries where the earnings are considered to be permanently reinvested. The Company intends to continue to reinvest these earnings in international operations. If the Company decided at a later date to repatriate these earnings to the U.S., the Company would be required to provide for the net tax effects on these amounts. The Company does not determine the deferred tax liability associated with these undistributed earnings, as such determination is not practical. See Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding income taxes. Net Earnings Per Share Basic earnings per share is computed by dividing net earnings available to common shareholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the period. Diluted earnings per share reflects the potential dilution that could occur if securities were exercised or converted into common stock using the treasury stock method. Use of Estimates The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported. Estimates are used when accounting for sales discounts, rebates, allowances and incentives, product liabilities, income taxes, depreciation, amortization, employee benefits, contingencies and intangible asset and liability valuations. Actual results may or may not differ from those estimates. The Company follows the provisions of U.S. GAAP when recording litigation related contingencies. A liability is recorded when a loss is probable and can be reasonably estimated. The best estimate of a loss within a range is accrued; however, if no estimate in the range is better than any other, the minimum amount is accrued. Annual Closing Date The Company follows the concept of a fiscal year, which ends on the Sunday nearest to the end of the month of December. Normally each fiscal year consists of 52 weeks, but every five or six years the fiscal year consists of 53 weeks , as was the case in 2015, and will be the case again in 2020. Reclassification Certain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to current year presentation.  ##TABLE_START  ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START 2.

The contractual maturities of substantially all available for sale securities are from one to five years at January 3, 2016 . The Company invests its excess cash in both deposits with major banks throughout the world and other high-quality money market instruments. The Company has a policy of making investments only with commercial institutions that have at least an investment grade credit rating. ##TABLE_START 3.

Depreciation expense, including the amortization of capitalized interest in 2015 , 2014 and 2013 , was $2.5 billion , $2.5 billion and $2.7 billion , respectively. Upon retirement or other disposal of property, plant and equipment, the costs and related amounts of accumulated depreciation or amortization are eliminated from the asset and accumulated depreciation accounts, respectively. The difference, if any, between the net asset value and the proceeds are recorded in earnings. ##TABLE_START 5. Intangible Assets and Goodwill ##TABLE_END At the end of 2015 and 2014 , the gross and net amounts of intangible assets were: ##TABLE_START (Dollars in Millions)   Intangible assets with definite lives:     Patents and trademarks  gross  $ 8,299  9,074 Less accumulated amortization  4,745  4,700 Patents and trademarks  net  $ 3,554  4,374 Customer relationships and other intangibles  gross  $ 17,583  17,970 Less accumulated amortization  5,816  5,227 Customer relationships and other intangibles  net  $ 11,767  12,743 Intangible assets with indefinite lives:     Trademarks  $ 7,023  7,263 Purchased in-process research and development  3,420  2,842 Total intangible assets with indefinite lives  $ 10,443  10,105 Total intangible assets  net  $ 25,764  27,222 ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  ##TABLE_END Goodwill as of January 3, 2016 and December 28, 2014 , as allocated by segment of business, was as follows: ##TABLE_START (Dollars in Millions)  Consumer  Pharmaceutical  Med Devices  Total Goodwill at December 29, 2013  $ 8,531  2,068  12,199  22,798 Goodwill, related to acquisitions      Goodwill, related to divestitures  (138 )    (603 )  (741 ) Currency translation/other  (731 )  (107 )  (65 )  (903 ) Goodwill at December 28, 2014  $ 7,675  2,626  11,531  21,832 Goodwill, related to acquisitions     Goodwill, related to divestitures  (119 )  (17 )  (57 )  (193 ) Currency translation/other  (426 )  (86 )  (8 )  (520 ) Goodwill at January 3, 2016  $ 7,240  2,889  11,500  21,629 ##TABLE_ENDThe weighted average amortization periods for patents and trademarks and customer relationships and other intangible assets are 18 years and 24 years , respectively. The amortization expense of amortizable assets included in cost of products sold was $1.2 billion , $1.4 billion and $1.4 billion before tax, for the fiscal years ended January 3, 2016 , December 28, 2014 and December 29, 2013 , respectively. The estimated amortization expense for the five succeeding years approximates $1.2 billion before tax, per year. Intangible asset write-downs are included in Other (income) expense, net. See Note 20 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional details related to acquisitions and divestitures. ##TABLE_START 6. Fair Value Measurements ##TABLE_END The Company uses forward foreign exchange contracts to manage its exposure to the variability of cash flows, primarily related to the foreign exchange rate changes of future intercompany products and third-party purchases of materials denominated in a foreign currency. The Company uses cross currency interest rate swaps to manage currency risk primarily related to borrowings. Both types of derivatives are designated as cash flow hedges. Additionally, the Company uses interest rate swaps as an instrument to manage interest rate risk related to fixed rate borrowings. These derivatives are treated as fair value hedges. The Company may use forward foreign exchange contracts designated as net investment hedges. Additionally, the Company uses forward foreign exchange contracts to offset its exposure to certain foreign currency assets and liabilities. These forward foreign exchange contracts are not designated as hedges and therefore, changes in the fair values of these derivatives are recognized in earnings, thereby offsetting the current earnings effect of the related foreign currency assets and liabilities. The Company does not enter into derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes, or that contain credit risk related contingent features or requirements to post collateral by either the Company or the counter-party. On an ongoing basis, the Company monitors counterparty credit ratings. The Company considers credit non-performance risk to be low, because the Company primarily enters into agreements with commercial institutions that have at least an investment grade credit rating. Refer to the table on significant financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value contained in this footnote for receivables and payables with these commercial institutions. As of January 3, 2016 , the Company had notional amounts outstanding for forward foreign exchange contracts, cross currency interest rate swaps and interest rate swaps of $31.2 billion , $2.3 billion and $2.2 billion , respectively. All derivative instruments are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value. Changes in the fair value of derivatives are recorded each period in current earnings or other comprehensive income, depending on whether the derivative is designated as part of a hedge transaction, and if so, the type of hedge transaction. The designation as a cash flow hedge is made at the entrance date of the derivative contract. At inception, all derivatives are expected to be highly effective. Changes in the fair value of a derivative that is designated as a cash flow hedge and is highly effective are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income until the underlying transaction affects earnings, and are then reclassified to earnings in the same account as the hedged transaction. Gains and losses associated with interest rate swaps and changes in fair value of hedged debt attributable to changes in interest rates are recorded to interest expense in the period in which they occur. Gains and losses on net investment hedges are accounted for through the currency translation account and are insignificant. On an ongoing basis, the Company assesses whether each derivative continues to be highly effective in offsetting changes of hedged items. If and when a derivative is no longer expected to be highly effective, hedge accounting is discontinued. Hedge ineffectiveness, if any, is included in current period earnings in Other (income) expense, net for forward foreign exchange contracts and cross currency interest rate swaps. For interest rate swaps designated as fair value hedges, hedge ineffectiveness, if any, is included in current period earnings within interest expense. For the current reporting period, hedge ineffectiveness associated with interest rate swaps was not material.  ##TABLE_START  ##TABLE_END As of January 3, 2016 , the balance of deferred net losses on derivatives included in accumulated other comprehensive income was $36 million after-tax. For additional information, see the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income and Note 13. The Company expects that substantially all of the amounts related to forward foreign exchange contracts will be reclassified into earnings over the next 12 months as a result of transactions that are expected to occur over that period. The maximum length of time over which the Company is hedging transaction exposure is 18 months , excluding interest rate contracts. The amount ultimately realized in earnings may differ as foreign exchange rates change. Realized gains and losses are ultimately determined by actual exchange rates at maturity of the derivative. The following table is a summary of the activity related to derivatives designated as cash flow hedges for the fiscal years ended January 3, 2016 and December 28, 2014 : ##TABLE_START (Dollars in Millions)  Gain/(Loss) Recognized In Accumulated OCI (1)  Gain/(Loss) Reclassified From Accumulated OCI Into Income (1)  Gain/(Loss) Recognized In Other Income/Expense (2) Cash Flow Hedges by Income Statement Caption       Sales to customers (3)  $ (83 )  (106 )  (126 )  (3 )  (5 )  (5 ) Cost of products sold (3)  (22 )      Research and development expense (3)  (3 )       Interest (income)/Interest expense, net (4)  (40 )     (15 )     Other (income) expense, net (3)        Total  $ (115 )      (3 ) ##TABLE_ENDAll amounts shown in the table above are net of tax. ##TABLE_START (1)  Effective portion ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (2)  Ineffective portion ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (3)  Forward foreign exchange contracts ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (4)  Cross currency interest rate swaps  ##TABLE_END For the fiscal years ended January 3, 2016 and December 28, 2014 , a loss of $34 million and a gain of $5 million , respectively, was recognized in Other (income) expense, net, relating to forward foreign exchange contracts not designated as hedging instruments. Fair value is the exit price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability. Fair value is a market-based measurement determined using assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability. The authoritative literature establishes a three-level hierarchy to prioritize the inputs used in measuring fair value. The levels within the hierarchy are described below with Level 1 having the highest priority and Level 3 having the lowest. The fair value of a derivative financial instrument (i.e. forward foreign exchange contracts, interest rate contracts) is the aggregation by currency of all future cash flows discounted to its present value at the prevailing market interest rates and subsequently converted to the U.S. Dollar at the current spot foreign exchange rate. The Company does not believe that fair values of these derivative instruments materially differ from the amounts that could be realized upon settlement or maturity, or that the changes in fair value will have a material effect on the Companys results of operations, cash flows or financial position. The Company also holds equity investments which are classified as Level 1 and debt securities which are classified as Level 2. The Company did not have any other significant financial assets or liabilities which would require revised valuations under this standard that are recognized at fair value. The following three levels of inputs are used to measure fair value: Level 1  Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities. Level 2  Significant other observable inputs. Level 3  Significant unobservable inputs. The Companys significant financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value as of January 3, 2016 and December 28, 2014 were as follows:  ##TABLE_START  ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    (Dollars in Millions)  Level 1  Level 2  Level 3  Total  Total (1) Derivatives designated as hedging instruments:           Assets:           Forward foreign exchange contracts (7)  $       Interest rate contracts (2)(4)(7)        Total        1,027 Liabilities:           Forward foreign exchange contracts (8)        Interest rate contracts (3)(4)(8)        Total        Derivatives not designated as hedging instruments:           Assets:           Forward foreign exchange contracts (7)        Liabilities:           Forward foreign exchange contracts (8)        Available For Sale Other Investments:           Equity investments (5)  1,494      1,494  Debt securities (6)  $   8,316    8,316   ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (1)  2014 assets and liabilities are all classified as Level 2 with the exception of equity investments of $679 million , which are classified as Level 1. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (2)  Includes $20 million and $29 million of non-current assets for the fiscal years ending January 3, 2016 and December 28, 2014 , respectively. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (3)  Includes $239 million and $8 million of non-current liabilities for the fiscal years ending January 3, 2016 and December 28, 2014 , respectively. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (4)  Includes cross currency interest rate swaps and interest rate swaps. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (5)  Classified as non-current other assets.

The 2015 effective tax rate decrease as compared to 2014 was primarily attributable to the increases in taxable income in lower tax jurisdictions relative to higher tax jurisdictions and a tax benefit resulting from a restructuring of international affiliates. Additionally, the 2014 effective tax rate was affected by the items mentioned below. The increase in the 2014 effective tax rate, as compared to 2013, was attributable to the following: the divestiture of the Ortho-Clinical Diagnostics business at an approximate 44% effective tax rate, litigation accruals at low tax rates, the mix of earnings into higher tax jurisdictions, primarily the U.S., the accrual of an additional year of the Branded Prescription Drug Fee, which is not tax deductible, and additional U.S. tax expense related to a planned increase in dividends from current year foreign earnings as compared to the prior year. These increases to the 2014 effective tax rate were partially offset by a tax benefit of $0.4 billion associated with the Conor Medsystems divestiture.  ##TABLE_START  ##TABLE_END The 2013 effective tax rate was reduced by a tax benefit associated with the write-off of assets for tax purposes associated with Scios, Inc., and the inclusion of both the 2013 and 2012 benefit from the Research and Development tax credit and the Controlled Foreign Corporation look-through provisions, because those provisions were enacted into law in January 2013 and were retroactive to January 1, 2012. The 2014 effective tax rate was also reduced as the Company adjusted its unrecognized tax benefits as a result of (i) the federal appeals courts decision in OMJ Pharmaceuticals, Inc.s litigation regarding credits under former Section 936 of the Internal Revenue Code (see Note 21 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information), and (ii) a settlement of substantially all issues related to the Companys U.S. Internal Revenue Service audit of tax years 2006 - 2009. The impact of the settlement is reflected in the U.S. tax on international income and the All other line items within the above reconciliation. The items noted above reflect the key drivers of the rate reconciliation. Temporary differences and carryforwards for 2015 and 2014 were as follows: ##TABLE_START   2015 Deferred Tax  2014 Deferred Tax (Dollars in Millions)  Asset  Liability  Asset  Liability Employee related obligations  $ 2,863   3,426  Stock based compensation     Depreciation   (247 )   (564 ) Non-deductible intangibles   (6,663 )   (6,671 ) International RD capitalized for tax  1,318   1,433  Reserves  liabilities  1,801   1,497  Income reported for tax purposes    1,067  Net operating loss carryforward international     Miscellaneous international  (1)  (249 )  1,128 (1)  (305 ) Miscellaneous U.S.     Total deferred income taxes  $ 10,087  (7,159 )  11,295  (7,540 ) ##TABLE_END(1) The $922 million in 2015 was net of a valuation allowance related to Belgium of $196 million . The $1,128 million in 2014 was net of a valuation allowance related to Belgium of $172 million . The Company has wholly-owned international subsidiaries that have cumulative net losses. The Company believes that it is more likely than not that these subsidiaries will realize future taxable income sufficient to utilize these deferred tax assets. The following table summarizes the activity related to unrecognized tax benefits: ##TABLE_START (Dollars in Millions)    Beginning of year  $ 2,465  2,729  3,054 Increases related to current year tax positions    Increases related to prior period tax positions    Decreases related to prior period tax positions  (79 )  (288 )  (574 ) Settlements  (4 )  (477 )  (418 ) Lapse of statute of limitations  (54 )  (75 )  (56 ) End of year  $ 3,080  2,465  2,729 ##TABLE_ENDThe unrecognized tax benefits of $3.1 billion at January 3, 2016 , if recognized, would affect the Companys annual effective tax rate. The Company conducts business and files tax returns in numerous countries and currently has tax audits in progress with a number of tax authorities. The IRS has completed its audit for the tax years through 2009 and is currently auditing the tax years 2010-2012. In other major jurisdictions where the Company conducts business, the years remain open generally back to the year 2004. The Company believes it is possible that audits may be completed by tax authorities in some jurisdictions over the next twelve months. However, the Company is not able to provide a reasonably reliable estimate of the timing of any other future tax payments relating to uncertain tax positions. The Company classifies liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits and related interest and penalties as long-term liabilities. Interest expense and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits are classified as income tax expense. The Company recognized after tax interest expense of $44 million , $12 million and $40 million in 2015 , 2014 and 2013 , respectively. The total amount of accrued interest was $366 million and $298 million in 2015 and 2014 , respectively.  ##TABLE_START  ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START 9. Employee Related Obligations ##TABLE_END At the end of 2015 and 2014 , employee related obligations recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets were: ##TABLE_START (Dollars in Millions)   Pension benefits  $ 3,857  4,547 Postretirement benefits  2,738  3,161 Postemployment benefits  2,092  2,062 Deferred compensation   Total employee obligations  9,271  10,369 Less current benefits payable   Employee related obligations  non-current  $ 8,854  9,972 ##TABLE_ENDPrepaid employee related obligations of $256 million and $233 million for 2015 and 2014 , respectively, are included in Other assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. ##TABLE_START 10. Pensions and Other Benefit Plans ##TABLE_END The Company sponsors various retirement and pension plans, including defined benefit, defined contribution and termination indemnity plans, which cover most employees worldwide. The Company also provides post-retirement benefits, primarily health care, to all eligible U.S. retired employees and their dependents. Many international employees are covered by government-sponsored programs and the cost to the Company is not significant. Retirement plan benefits for employees hired before January 1, 2015 are primarily based on the employees compensation during the last three to five years before retirement and the number of years of service. In 2014, the Company announced that the U.S. Defined Benefit plan was amended to adopt a new benefit formula, effective for employees hired on or after January 1, 2015. The benefits are calculated using a new formula based on employee compensation over total years of service. International subsidiaries have plans under which funds are deposited with trustees, annuities are purchased under group contracts, or reserves are provided. The Company does not fund retiree health care benefits in advance and has the right to modify these plans in the future. As described in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, the Company has elected to early adopt a practical expedient beginning for the fiscal year end 2015 to measure its defined benefit plans using the calendar month end closest to its fiscal year end. In 2015 and 2014 the Company used December 31, 2015 and December 28, 2014 , respectively, as the measurement date for all U.S. and international retirement and other benefit plans. Net periodic benefit costs for the Companys defined benefit retirement plans and other benefit plans for 2015 , 2014 and 2013 include the following components: ##TABLE_START   Retirement Plans  Other Benefit Plans (Dollars in Millions)       Service cost  $ 1,037      Interest cost   1,018     Expected return on plan assets  (1,809 )  (1,607 )  (1,447 )  (7 )  (7 )  (6 ) Amortization of prior service cost (credit)     (33 )  (34 )  (2 ) Amortization of net transition obligation           Recognized actuarial losses       Curtailments and settlements   (17 )        Net periodic benefit cost  $   1,055    ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  ##TABLE_END Amounts expected to be recognized in net periodic benefit cost in the coming year for the Companys defined benefit retirement plans and other post-retirement plans: ##TABLE_START (Dollars in Millions)  Amortization of net transition obligation $  Amortization of net actuarial losses Amortization of prior service credit ##TABLE_ENDUnrecognized gains and losses for the U.S. pension plans are amortized over the average remaining future service for each plan. For plans with no active employees, they are amortized over the average life expectancy. The amortization of gains and losses for the other U.S. benefit plans is determined by using a 10% corridor of the greater of the market value of assets or the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation. Total unamortized gains and losses in excess of the corridor are amortized over the average remaining future service. Prior service costs/benefits for the U.S. pension plans are amortized over the average remaining future service of plan participants at the time of the plan amendment. Prior service cost/benefit for the other U.S. benefit plans is amortized over the average remaining service to full eligibility age of plan participants at the time of the plan amendment. The following table represents the weighted-average actuarial assumptions: ##TABLE_START   Retirement Plans  Other Benefit Plans Worldwide Benefit Plans       Net Periodic Benefit Cost             Discount rate  3.78 %  4.78  4.25  4.31  5.25  4.55 Rate of increase in compensation levels  4.05 %  4.08  4.08  4.11  4.29  4.28 Expected long-term rate of return on plan assets  8.53 %  8.46  8.45                    Benefit Obligation             Discount rate  4.11 %  3.78  4.78  4.63  4.31  5.25 Rate of increase in compensation levels  4.01 %  4.05  4.08  4.28  4.11  4.29 ##TABLE_ENDThe Companys discount rates are determined by considering current yield curves representing high quality, long-term fixed income instruments. The resulting discount rates are consistent with the duration of plan liabilities. For the fiscal year 2016, the Company will change its methodology in determining service and interest cost from the single weighted average discount rate approach to duration specific spot rates along that yield curve to the plans liability cash flows, which management has concluded is a more precise estimate. Prior to this change in methodology, the Company measured service and interest costs utilizing a single weighted-average discount rate derived from the yield curve used to measure the plan obligations. The Company has accounted for this change as a change in accounting estimate and, accordingly, has accounted for it on a prospective basis. This change will not impact the benefit obligation and will not have a material impact to the 2016 full year results. The expected rates of return on plan asset assumptions represent the Company's assessment of long-term returns on diversified investment portfolios globally. The assessment is determined using projections from external financial sources, long-term historical averages, actual returns by asset class and the various asset class allocations by market. In 2014, for measurement of U.S. retirement benefit obligations, the mortality assumption was updated to a newly established 2014 mortality table resulting in an increase to the projected benefit obligation.  ##TABLE_START  ##TABLE_END The following table displays the assumed health care cost trend rates, for all individuals: ##TABLE_START Health Care Plans   Health care cost trend rate assumed for next year  6.60 %  6.00 % Rate to which the cost trend rate is assumed to decline (ultimate trend)  4.50 %  4.50 % Year the rate reaches the ultimate trend rate   ##TABLE_ENDA one-percentage-point change in assumed health care cost trend rates would have the following effect: ##TABLE_START   One-Percentage-  One-Percentage- (Dollars in Millions)  Point Increase  Point Decrease Health Care Plans     Total interest and service cost  $  (29 ) Post-retirement benefit obligation  $  (326 ) ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  ##TABLE_END The following table sets forth information related to the benefit obligation and the fair value of plan assets at year-end 2015 and 2014 for the Companys defined benefit retirement plans and other post-retirement plans: ##TABLE_START   Retirement Plans  Other Benefit Plans (Dollars in Millions)     Change in Benefit Obligation         Projected benefit obligation  beginning of year  $ 26,889  21,488  5,081  4,407 Service cost  1,037    Interest cost   1,018   Plan participant contributions       Amendments   (60 )    (254 ) Actuarial (gains) losses  (1,578 )  5,395  (400 )  1,030 Divestitures  acquisitions  (5 )  (121 )     Curtailments, settlements  restructuring  (20 )  (53 )  (3 )   Benefits paid from plan  (773 )  (813 )  (420 )  (493 ) Effect of exchange rates  (791 )  (906 )  (32 )  (17 ) Projected benefit obligation  end of year  $ 25,855  26,889  4,669  5,081 Change in Plan Assets         Plan assets at fair value  beginning of year  $ 22,575  20,901   Actual return on plan assets   2,078   Company contributions   1,176   Plan participant contributions       Settlements  (20 )  (40 )     Divestitures  acquisitions  (5 )  (109 )     Benefits paid from plan assets  (773 )  (813 )  (420 )  (493 ) Effect of exchange rates  (621 )  (677 )     Plan assets at fair value  end of year  $ 22,254  22,575   Funded status  end of year  $ (3,601 )  (4,314 )  (4,595 )  (5,002 ) Amounts Recognized in the Companys Balance Sheet consist of the following:         Non-current assets  $      Current liabilities  (77 )  (74 )  (324 )  (309 ) Non-current liabilities  (3,780 )  (4,473 )  (4,271 )  (4,693 ) Total recognized in the consolidated balance sheet  end of year  $ (3,601 )  (4,314 )  (4,595 )  (5,002 ) Amounts Recognized in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income consist of the following:         Net actuarial loss  $ 6,501  7,547  2,013  2,611 Prior service cost (credit)   (33 )  (185 )  (225 ) Unrecognized net transition obligation        Total before tax effects  $ 6,535  7,515  1,828  2,386          Accumulated Benefit Obligations  end of year  $ 23,262  23,816                                ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START   Retirement Plans  Other Benefit Plans (Dollars in Millions)     Amounts Recognized in Net Periodic Benefit Cost and Other Comprehensive Income         Net periodic benefit cost  $    Net actuarial (gain) loss  (75 )  4,942  (389 )  1,015 Amortization of net actuarial loss  (745 )  (460 )  (201 )  (136 ) Prior service cost (credit)   (60 )    (253 ) Amortization of prior service (cost) credit  (2 )  (6 )   Effect of exchange rates  (218 )  (273 )  (1 )   Total recognized in other comprehensive income, before tax  $ (980 )  4,143  (558 )  Total recognized in net periodic benefit cost and other comprehensive income  $ (9 )  4,886   1,163 ##TABLE_ENDThe Company plans to continue to fund its U.S. Qualified Plans to comply with the Pension Protection Act of 2006. International Plans are funded in accordance with local regulations. Additional discretionary contributions are made when deemed appropriate to meet the long-term obligations of the plans. For certain plans, funding is not a common practice, as funding provides no economic benefit. Consequently, the Company has several pension plans that are not funded. In 2015 , the Company contributed $435 million and $317 million to its U.S. and international pension plans, respectively. The following table displays the funded status of the Company's U.S. Qualified  Non-Qualified pension plans and international funded and unfunded pension plans at December 31, 2015 and December 28, 2014 , respectively: ##TABLE_START  U.S. Plans International Plans  Qualified Plans Non-Qualified Plans Funded Plans Unfunded Plans (Dollars in Millions) 2014 2014 2014 2014 Plan Assets $ 15,113 15,201   7,141 7,374   Projected Benefit Obligation 15,280 15,571 1,675 1,683 8,542 9,203 432 Accumulated Benefit Obligation 13,876 13,875 1,411 1,363 7,661 8,205 373 Over (Under) Funded Status         Projected Benefit Obligation $ (167 ) (370 ) (1,675 ) (1,683 ) (1,401 ) (1,829 ) (358 ) (432 ) Accumulated Benefit Obligation 1,237 1,326 (1,411 ) (1,363 ) (520 ) (831 ) (314 ) (373 ) ##TABLE_ENDPlans with accumulated benefit obligations in excess of plan assets have an accumulated benefit obligation, projected benefit obligation and plan assets of $4.5 billion , $5.3 billion and $1.9 billion , respectively, at the end of 2015 , and $8.2 billion , $9.4 billion and $5.3 billion , respectively, at the end of 2014 .

In determining investment policies, strategies and goals, each committee or board considers factors including, local pension rules and regulations; local tax regulations; availability of investment vehicles (separate accounts, commingled accounts, insurance funds, etc.); funded status of the plans; ratio of actives to retirees; duration of liabilities; and other relevant factors including: diversification, liquidity of local markets and liquidity of base currency. A majority of the Companys pension funds are open to new entrants and are expected to be on-going plans. Permitted investments are primarily liquid and/or listed, with little reliance on illiquid and non-traditional investments such as hedge funds. The Companys retirement plan asset allocation at the end of 2015 and 2014 and target allocations for 2016 are as follows: ##TABLE_START   Percent of Plan Assets  Target Allocation     Worldwide Retirement Plans       Equity securities  %  %  % Debt securities    Total plan assets  %  %  % ##TABLE_ENDDetermination of Fair Value of Plan Assets The Plan has an established and well-documented process for determining fair values. Fair value is based upon quoted market prices, where available. If listed prices or quotes are not available, fair value is based upon models that primarily use, as inputs, market-based or independently sourced market parameters, including yield curves, interest rates, volatilities, equity or debt prices, foreign exchange rates and credit curves. While the Plan believes its valuation methods are appropriate and consistent with other market participants, the use of different methodologies or assumptions to determine the fair value of certain financial instruments could result in a different estimate of fair value at the reporting date. Valuation Hierarchy The authoritative literature establishes a three-level hierarchy to prioritize the inputs used in measuring fair value. The levels within the hierarchy are described in the table below with Level 1 having the highest priority and Level 3 having the lowest. A financial instruments categorization within the valuation hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. Following is a description of the valuation methodologies used for the investments measured at fair value. ##TABLE_START  Short-term investments  Cash and quoted short-term instruments are valued at the closing price or the amount held on deposit by the custodian bank. Other investments are through investment vehicles valued using the Net Asset Value (NAV) provided by the administrator of the fund. The NAV is based on the value of the underlying assets owned by the fund, minus its liabilities, and then divided by the number of shares outstanding. The NAV is a quoted price in a market that is not active and classified as Level 2. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Government and agency securities  A limited number of these investments are valued at the closing price reported on the major market on which the individual securities are traded. Where quoted prices are available in an active market, the investments are classified within Level 1 of the valuation hierarchy. If quoted market prices are not available for the specific security, then fair values are estimated by using pricing models, quoted prices of securities with similar characteristics or discounted cash flows. When quoted market prices for a security are not available in an active market, they are classified as Level 2. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Debt instruments  A limited number of these investments are valued at the closing price reported on the major market on which the individual securities are traded. Where quoted prices are available in an active market, the investments are classified as Level 1. If quoted market prices are not available for the specific security, then fair values are estimated by using pricing models, quoted prices of securities with similar characteristics or discounted cash flows and are classified as Level 2. Level 3 debt instruments are priced based on unobservable inputs. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Equity securities  Common stocks are valued at the closing price reported on the major market on which the individual securities are traded. Substantially all common stock is classified within Level 1 of the valuation hierarchy. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Commingled funds  These investment vehicles are valued using the NAV provided by the fund administrator. The NAV is based on the value of the underlying assets owned by the fund, minus its liabilities, and then divided by the number of shares outstanding. Assets in the Level 2 category have a quoted market price in a market that is not active. ##TABLE_END  ##TABLE_START  ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  Insurance contracts  The instruments are issued by insurance companies. The fair value is based on negotiated value and the underlying investments held in separate account portfolios as well as considering the credit worthiness of the issuer. The underlying investments are government, asset-backed and fixed income securities. In general, insurance contracts are classified as Level 3 as there are no quoted prices nor other observable inputs for pricing. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Other assets  Other assets are represented primarily by limited partnerships and real estate investments, as well as commercial loans and commercial mortgages that are not classified as corporate debt. Other assets that are exchange listed and actively traded are classified as Level 1, while inactively traded assets are classified as Level 2. Most limited partnerships represent investments in private equity and similar funds that are valued by the general partners. Certain of these limited partnerships, as well as any other assets valued using unobservable inputs, are classified as Level 3. ##TABLE_END The following table sets forth the Retirement Plans' investments measured at fair value as of December 31, 2015 and December 28, 2014 : ##TABLE_START   Quoted Prices in Active Markets for Identical Assets  Significant Other Observable Inputs  Significant Unobservable Inputs       (Level 1)  (Level 2)  (Level 3)  Total Assets (Dollars in Millions)         Short-term investment funds  $          Government and agency securities      1,767  1,934      1,767  1,934 Debt instruments      1,050  1,143    1,051  1,144 Equity securities  11,317  11,204        11,328  11,225 Commingled funds      7,189  7,205    7,222  7,251 Insurance contracts             Other assets          Investments at fair value  $ 11,501  11,373  10,643  11,068    22,254  22,575 ##TABLE_ENDThe Company's Other Benefit Plans are unfunded except for U.S. commingled funds (Level 2) of $74 million and $79 million at December 31, 2015 and December 28, 2014 , respectively.

International Currency Translation ##TABLE_END For translation of its subsidiaries operating in non-U.S. Dollar currencies, the Company has determined that the local currencies of its international subsidiaries are the functional currencies except those in highly inflationary economies, which are defined as those which have had compound cumulative rates of inflation of 100% or more during the past three years , or where a substantial portion of its cash flows are not in the local currency. In consolidating international subsidiaries, balance sheet currency effects are recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income. This equity account includes the results of translating certain balance sheet assets and liabilities at current exchange rates and some accounts at historical rates, except for those located in highly inflationary economies. The translation of balance sheet accounts for highly inflationary economies are reflected in the operating results. A rollforward of the changes during 2015 , 2014 and 2013 for foreign currency translation adjustments is included in Note 13.

Common Stock, Stock Option Plans and Stock Compensation Agreements ##TABLE_END  ##TABLE_START  ##TABLE_END At January 3, 2016 , the Company had 2 stock-based compensation plans. The shares outstanding are for contracts under the Company's 2005 Long-Term Incentive Plan and the 2012 Long-Term Incentive Plan. The 2005 Long-Term Incentive Plan expired April 26, 2012. All options and restricted shares granted subsequent to that date were under the 2012 Long-Term Incentive Plan. Under the 2012 Long-Term Incentive Plan, the Company may issue up to 650 million shares of common stock, plus any shares canceled, expired, forfeited, or not issued from the 2005 Long-Term Incentive Plan subsequent to April 26, 2012. Shares available for future grants under the 2012 Long-Term Incentive Plan were 486 million at the end of 2015 . The compensation cost that has been charged against income for these plans was $874 million , $792 million and $728 million for 2015 , 2014 and 2013 , respectively. The total income tax benefit recognized in the income statement for share-based compensation costs was $253 million , $259 million and $243 million for 2015 , 2014 and 2013 , respectively. The total unrecognized compensation cost was $744 million , $722 million and $636 million for 2015 , 2014 and 2013 , respectively. The weighted average period for this cost to be recognized was 0.98 years, 1.18 years and 1.26 years for 2015 , 2014 , and 2013 , respectively. Share-based compensation costs capitalized as part of inventory were insignificant in all periods. The Company settles employee benefit equity issuances with treasury shares. Treasury shares are replenished throughout the year for the number of shares used to settle employee benefit equity issuances. Stock Options Stock options expire 10 years from the date of grant and vest over service periods that range from 6 months to 4 years . All options are granted at the average of the high and low prices of the Companys Common Stock on the New York Stock Exchange on the date of grant. The fair value of each option award was estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option valuation model that uses the assumptions noted in the following table. For 2014 and 2013 grants, expected volatility represents a blended rate of 4-year daily historical average volatility rate, and a 5-week average implied volatility rate based on at-the-money traded Johnson  Johnson options with a life of 2 years. For 2015 grants, expected volatility represents a blended rate of 10-year weekly historical overall volatility rate, and a 5-week average implied volatility rate based on at-the-money traded Johnson  Johnson options with a life of 2 years. For all grants, historical data is used to determine the expected life of the option. The risk-free rate was based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant. The average fair value of options granted was $10.68 , $8.42 and $4.88 , in 2015 , 2014 and 2013 , respectively. The fair value was estimated based on the weighted average assumptions of: ##TABLE_START    Risk-free rate 1.77 %  1.87 %  1.01 % Expected volatility 15.48 %  14.60 %  14.04 % Expected life (in years) 7.0  6.0  6.0 Expected dividend yield 2.90 %  3.10 %  3.40 % ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  ##TABLE_END A summary of option activity under the Plan as of January 3, 2016 , December 28, 2014 and December 29, 2013 , and changes during the years ending on those dates is presented below: ##TABLE_START (Shares in Thousands)  Outstanding Shares  Weighted Average Exercise Price  Aggregate Intrinsic Value (Dollars in Millions) Shares at December 30, 2012  134,351  $ 61.58  $ 1,061 Options granted  29,010  72.54   Options exercised  (41,357 )  59.99   Options canceled/forfeited  (2,448 )  65.89   Shares at December 29, 2013  119,556  64.70  3,306 Options granted  24,356  90.44   Options exercised  (25,319 )  62.31   Options canceled/forfeited  (2,881 )  75.48   Shares at December 28, 2014  115,712  70.37  4,014 Options granted  20,484  100.06   Options exercised  (16,683 )  62.53   Options canceled/forfeited  (2,996 )  82.22   Shares at January 3, 2016  116,517  $ 76.41  $ 3,065 ##TABLE_ENDThe total intrinsic value of options exercised was $644 million , $954 million and $941 million in 2015 , 2014 and 2013 , respectively.

Restricted Share Units and Performance Share Units The Company grants restricted share units which vest over service periods that range from 6 months to 3 years . The Company also grants performance share units, which are paid in shares of Johnson  Johnson Common Stock after the end of a three -year performance period. Whether any performance share units vest, and the amount that does vest, is tied to the completion of service periods that range from 6 months to 3 years and the achievement, over a three-year period, of three equally-weighted goals that directly align with or help drive long-term total shareholder return: operational sales, adjusted operational earnings per share, and relative total shareholder return. The number of shares actually earned at the end of the three-year period will vary, based only on actual performance, from 0% to 200% of the target number of performance share units granted .  ##TABLE_START  ##TABLE_END A summary of the restricted share units and performance share units activity under the Plans as of January 3, 2016 is presented below: ##TABLE_START (Shares in Thousands)  Outstanding Restricted Share Units  Outstanding Performance Share Units Shares at December 30, 2012  31,834  Granted  10,582  1,290 Issued  (10,078 )   Canceled/forfeited  (1,721 )  (40 ) Shares at December 29, 2013  30,617  1,535 Granted  8,487  1,113 Issued  (9,685 )  (19 ) Canceled/forfeited  (1,726 )  (98 ) Shares at December 28, 2014  27,693  2,531 Granted  7,637  Issued  (10,164 )  (285 ) Canceled/forfeited  (1,281 )  (99 ) Shares at January 3, 2016  23,885  3,078 ##TABLE_ENDThe average fair value of the restricted share units granted was $91.65 , $83.01 and $65.90 in 2015 , 2014 and 2013 , respectively, using the fair market value at the date of grant. The fair value of restricted share units was discounted for dividends, which are not paid on the restricted share units during the vesting period. The fair value of restricted share units issued was $597.6 million , $541.0 million and $569.2 million in 2015 , 2014 and 2013 , respectively. The weighted average fair value of the performance share units granted was $93.54 , $85.94 and $73.42 in 2015 , 2014 and 2013 , calculated using the weighted average fair market value for each of the three component goals at the date of grant. The fair values for the sales and earnings per share goals of each performance share unit were estimated on the date of grant using the fair market value of the shares at the time of the award discounted for dividends, which are not paid on the performance share units during the vesting period. The fair value for the relative total shareholder return goal of each performance share unit was estimated on the date of grant using the Monte Carlo valuation model. The fair value of performance share units issued was $16.7 million and $1.4 million in 2015 and 2014, respectively. No performance share units vested in 2013.  ##TABLE_START  ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START 18.

Business Combinations and Divestitures ##TABLE_END Certain businesses were acquired for $954 million in cash and $220 million of liabilities assumed during 2015. The assumed liabilities primarily represent the fair value of the contingent consideration of $210 million . These acquisitions were accounted for using the acquisition method and, accordingly, results of operations have been included in the financial statements from their respective dates of acquisition. The 2015 acquisitions primarily included: XO1 Limited, a privately-held biopharmaceutical company developing an anti-thrombin antibody and Novira Therapeutics, Inc., a privately held clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company developing innovative therapies for curative treatment of chronic hepatitis B virus infection. The excess of purchase price over the estimated fair value of tangible assets acquired amounted to $1,173 million and has been assigned to identifiable intangible assets, with any residual recorded to goodwill. Of this amount, approximately $839 million has been identified as the value of IPRD primarily associated with the acquisitions of XO1 Limited and Novira Therapeutics, Inc. The value of the IPRD was calculated using cash flow projections discounted for the inherent risk in the projects.  ##TABLE_START  ##TABLE_END The IPRD related to the acquisition of XO1 Limited of $360 million is associated with a recombinant human antibody developed to mimic the activity of a human antibody which appears to produce an anticoagulated state without predisposition to bleeding. A probability of success factor of 36.0% was used to reflect inherent clinical and regulatory risk. The discount rate applied was 11.75% . The IPRD related to the acquisition of Novira Therapeutics, Inc. of $396 million is associated with its lead candidate NVR 3-778 which is an investigational small molecule, direct-acting antiviral, for oral administration in patients with HBV that inhibits the HBV core or capsid protein. A probability of success factor of 51.0% was used to reflect inherent clinical and regulatory risk. The discount rate applied was 16.0% . Certain businesses were acquired for $2,129 million in cash and $38 million of liabilities assumed during 2014. These acquisitions were accounted for using the acquisition method and, accordingly, results of operations have been included in the financial statements from their respective dates of acquisition. The 2014 acquisitions included: Covagen AG, a privately-held, biopharmaceutical company specializing in the development of multispecific protein therapeutics through the FynomAb  technology platform; Alios BioPharma, Inc., a privately-held, clinical stage biopharmaceutical company focused on developing therapies for viral diseases; and the ORSL TM electrolyte ready-to-drink brand from Jagdale Industries Ltd. The excess of purchase price over the estimated fair value of tangible assets acquired amounted to $2,069 million and has been assigned to identifiable intangible assets, with any residual recorded to goodwill. Of this amount, approximately $1,913 million has been identified as the value of IPRD associated with the acquisitions of Covagen AG and Alios BioPharma, Inc. The value of the IPRD was calculated using cash flow projections discounted for the inherent risk in the projects. The IPRD related to the acquisition of Alios BioPharma, Inc. (Alios) of $1,688 million is associated with Alios lead compound AL-8176, an orally administered antiviral therapy for treatment of infants with respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). A probability of success factor of 60.0% was used to reflect inherent clinical and regulatory risk. The discount rate applied was 11.4% . The IPRD related to the acquisition of Covagen AG of $225 million is associated with Covagens lead compound COVA-322, currently in Phase 1b study for psoriasis and holding potential as a treatment for a broad range of inflammatory diseases including rheumatoid arthritis. A probability of success factor of 26.0% was used to reflect inherent clinical and regulatory risk. The discount rate applied was 12.5% . During 2015, the Company recorded a charge for the impairment of the IPRD related to the acquisition of Covagen AG. Certain businesses were acquired for $835 million in cash and $193 million of liabilities assumed during 2013. These acquisitions were accounted for using the acquisition method and, accordingly, results of operations have been included in the financial statements from their respective dates of acquisition. The assumed liabilities primarily represent the fair value of the contingent consideration which may be payable related to the acquisition of Aragon Pharmaceuticals, Inc., a privately-held, pharmaceutical discovery and development company focused on drugs to treat hormonally-driven cancers. As per terms of the agreement, additional payments of up to $350 million may be paid in the future based on reaching predetermined milestones. The 2013 acquisitions included: Flexible Stenting Solutions, Inc., a leading developer of innovative flexible peripheral arterial, venous and biliary stents; Shanghai Elsker Mother  Baby Co., Ltd, a baby care company in China and Aragon Pharmaceuticals, Inc. The excess of purchase price over the estimated fair value of tangible assets acquired amounted to $941 million and has been assigned to identifiable intangible assets, with any residual recorded to goodwill. Of this amount, approximately $831 million has been identified as the value of IPRD primarily associated with the acquisitions of Aragon Pharmaceuticals, Inc. The IPRD related to the acquisition of Aragon Pharmaceuticals, Inc. of $810 million is associated with Aragons androgen receptor antagonist program for treatment of hormonally-driven cancers. The value of the IPRD was calculated using cash flow projections discounted for the inherent risk in such projects. Probability of success factors ranging from 37% - 52.0% were used to reflect inherent clinical and regulatory risk. The discount rate applied was 15.5% . In 2012, the Company completed the acquisition of Synthes, Inc. for a purchase price of $20.2 billion in cash and stock. In connection with the acquisition of Synthes, Inc. the Company entered into two accelerated share repurchase (ASR) agreements. In 2013, the Company settled the remaining liabilities under the ASR agreements. While the Company believes that the transactions under each ASR agreement and a series of related internal transactions were consummated in a tax efficient manner in accordance with applicable law, it is possible that the Internal Revenue Service could assert one or more contrary positions to challenge the transactions from a tax perspective. If challenged, an amount up to the total purchase price for the Synthes shares could be treated as subject to applicable U.S. tax at approximately the statutory rate to the Company, plus interest. Supplemental pro forma information for 2015, 2014 and 2013 in accordance with U.S. GAAP standards related to business combinations, and goodwill and other intangible assets, is not provided, as the impact of the aforementioned acquisitions did not have a material effect on the Companys results of operations, cash flows or financial position. During 2015, the Company divestitures included: The Cordis business to Cardinal Health; the SPLENDA  brand to Heartland Food Products Group and the U.S. license rights to NUCYNTA  (tapentadol), NUCYNTA  ER (tapentadol extended-release tablets), and NUCYNTA  (tapentadol) oral solution. In 2015, the pre-tax gains on the divestitures of businesses were approximately $2.6 billion . As of January 3, 2016, assets held for sale were not material.  ##TABLE_START  ##TABLE_END During 2014, the Company divestitures included: The Ortho-Clinical Diagnostics business to The Carlyle Group; the K-Y  brand to Reckitt Benckiser Group PLC in the U.S. and certain other markets; and the BENECOL  brand to Raisio plc. In 2014, the pre-tax gains on the divestitures of businesses were approximately $2.4 billion . The Company completed the divestiture of its Ortho-Clinical Diagnostics business to The Carlyle Group for approximately $4.0 billion and the Company recorded a pre-tax gain of approximately $1.9 billion . Ortho-Clinical Diagnostics' results are included in the Company's Medical Devices segment. During 2013, the Company divestitures included: women's sanitary protection products in the U.S., Canada and the Caribbean to Energizer Holdings, Inc.; Rolaids  to Chattem, Inc.; DORIBAX  rights to Shionogi; and the sale of certain consumer brands and certain pharmaceutical products. In 2013, the pre-tax gains on the divestitures of businesses were $0.1 billion . ##TABLE_START 21. Legal Proceedings ##TABLE_END Johnson  Johnson and certain of its subsidiaries are involved in various lawsuits and claims regarding product liability, intellectual property, commercial and other matters; governmental investigations; and other legal proceedings that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of their business. The Company records accruals for loss contingencies associated with these legal matters when it is probable that a liability will be incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. As of January 3, 2016, the Company has determined that the liabilities associated with certain litigation matters are probable and can be reasonably estimated. The Company has accrued for these matters and will continue to monitor each related legal issue and adjust accruals as might be warranted based on new information and further developments in accordance with ASC 450-20-25. For these and other litigation and regulatory matters discussed below for which a loss is probable or reasonably possible, the Company is unable to estimate the possible loss or range of loss beyond the amounts already accrued. Amounts accrued for legal contingencies often result from a complex series of judgments about future events and uncertainties that rely heavily on estimates and assumptions. The ability to make such estimates and judgments can be affected by various factors, including whether damages sought in the proceedings are unsubstantiated or indeterminate; scientific and legal discovery has not commenced or is not complete; proceedings are in early stages; matters present legal uncertainties; there are significant facts in dispute; or there are numerous parties involved. In the Company's opinion, based on its examination of these matters, its experience to date and discussions with counsel, the ultimate outcome of legal proceedings, net of liabilities accrued in the Company's balance sheet, is not expected to have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial position. However, the resolution of, or increase in accruals for, one or more of these matters in any reporting period may have a material adverse effect on the Company's results of operations and cash flows for that period. PRODUCT LIABILITY Certain subsidiaries of Johnson  Johnson are involved in numerous product liability claims and lawsuits involving multiple products. Claimants in these cases seek substantial compensatory and, where available, punitive damages. While these subsidiaries believe they have substantial defenses, it is not feasible to predict the ultimate outcome of litigation. The Company has established accruals for product liability claims and lawsuits in compliance with ASC 450-20 based on currently available information, which in some cases may be limited. The Company accrues an estimate of the legal defense costs needed to defend each matter. For certain of these matters, the Company has accrued additional amounts such as estimated costs associated with settlements, damage and other losses. Product liability accruals can represent projected product liability for thousands of claims around the world, each in different litigation environments and with different fact patterns. Changes to the accruals may be required in the future as additional information becomes available. The most significant of these cases include the DePuy ASR XL Acetabular System and DePuy ASR Hip Resurfacing System, the PINNACLE  Acetabular Cup System, pelvic meshes, RISPERDAL  , and XARELTO  . As of January 3, 2016, in the United States there were approximately 5,300 plaintiffs with direct claims in pending lawsuits regarding injuries allegedly due to the DePuy ASR XL Acetabular System and DePuy ASR Hip Resurfacing System, 8,700 with respect to the PINNACLE  Acetabular Cup System, 46,700 with respect to pelvic meshes, 10,700 with respect to RISPERDAL  , and 5,000 with respect to XARELTO  . In August 2010, DePuy Orthopaedics, Inc. (DePuy) announced a worldwide voluntary recall of its ASR XL Acetabular System and DePuy ASR Hip Resurfacing System used in hip replacement surgery. Claims for personal injury have been made against DePuy and Johnson  Johnson. The number of pending lawsuits is expected to fluctuate as certain lawsuits are settled or dismissed and additional lawsuits are filed. Cases filed in federal courts in the United States have been organized as a  ##TABLE_START  ##TABLE_END multi-district litigation in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Ohio. Litigation has also been filed in countries outside of the United States, primarily in the United Kingdom, Canada and Australia. In November 2013, DePuy reached an agreement with a Court-appointed committee of lawyers representing ASR Hip System plaintiffs to establish a program to settle claims with eligible ASR Hip patients in the United States who had surgery to replace their ASR Hips, known as revision surgery, as of August 31, 2013. This settlement covered approximately 8,000 patients. In February 2015, DePuy reached an additional agreement which would effectively extend the existing settlement program to ASR Hip patients who had revision surgeries after August 31, 2013 and prior to February 1, 2015. This second agreement is estimated to cover approximately 1,800 additional patients. The estimated cost of these agreements is covered by existing accruals. This settlement program is expected to bring to a close significant ASR Hip litigation activity in the United States. However, many lawsuits in the United States will remain, and the settlement program does not address litigation outside of the United States. The Company continues to receive information with respect to potential costs associated with this recall on a worldwide basis. The Company has established accruals for the costs associated with the DePuy ASR Hip program and related product liability litigation. Changes to these accruals may be required in the future as additional information becomes available. Claims for personal injury have also been made against DePuy and Johnson  Johnson relating to DePuy's PINNACLE  Acetabular Cup System used in hip replacement surgery. The number of pending product liability lawsuits continues to increase, and the Company continues to receive information with respect to potential costs and the anticipated number of cases. Cases filed in federal courts in the United States have been organized as a multi-district litigation in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Texas. Litigation has also been filed in countries outside of the United States, primarily in the United Kingdom. The Company has established an accrual to cover only defense costs in connection with product liability litigation associated with DePuy's PINNACLE  Acetabular Cup System. Changes to this accrual may be required in the future as additional information becomes available. Claims for personal injury have been made against Ethicon, Inc. (Ethicon) and Johnson  Johnson arising out of Ethicon's pelvic mesh devices used to treat stress urinary incontinence and pelvic organ prolapse. The number of pending product liability lawsuits continues to increase, and the Company continues to receive information with respect to potential costs and the anticipated number of cases. Cases filed in federal courts in the United States have been organized as a multi-district litigation in the United States District Court for the Southern District of West Virginia. In addition, class actions and individual personal injury cases or claims have been commenced in Australia, Belgium, Canada, England, Israel, Italy, the Netherlands, Scotland and Venezuela, seeking damages for alleged injury resulting from Ethicon's pelvic mesh devices. The Company has established an accrual with respect to product liability litigation associated with Ethicon's pelvic mesh products. Changes to this accrual may be required in the future as additional information becomes available. Claims for personal injury have been made against Janssen Pharmaceuticals, Inc. and Johnson  Johnson arising out of the use of RISPERDAL  , indicated for the treatment of schizophrenia, acute manic or mixed episodes associated with bipolar I disorder and irritability associated with autism, and related compounds. The number of pending product liability lawsuits continues to increase, and the Company continues to receive information with respect to potential costs and the anticipated number of cases. The Company has established an accrual with respect to product liability litigation associated with RISPERDAL  . Changes to this accrual may be required in the future as additional information becomes available. Claims for personal injury have been made against Janssen Pharmaceuticals, Inc. and Johnson  Johnson arising out of the use of XARELTO  , an oral anticoagulant. The number of pending product liability lawsuits continues to increase, and the Company continues to receive information with respect to potential costs and the anticipated number of cases. Cases filed in federal courts in the United States have been organized as a multi-district litigation in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Louisiana. In addition, cases have been filed in state courts across the United States and many cases have been consolidated into a state mass tort litigation in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Class action lawsuits also have been filed in Canada. The Company has established an accrual with respect to product liability litigation associated with XARELTO  . Changes to this accrual may be required in the future as additional information becomes available.  ##TABLE_START  ##TABLE_END INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY Certain subsidiaries of Johnson  Johnson are subject, from time to time, to legal proceedings and claims related to patent, trademark and other intellectual property matters arising out of their businesses. Many of these matters involve challenges to the coverage and/or validity of the patents on various products and allegations that certain of the Companys products infringe the patents of third parties. Although these subsidiaries believe that they have substantial defenses to these challenges and allegations with respect to all significant patents, there can be no assurance as to the outcome of these matters. A loss in any of these cases could adversely affect the ability of these subsidiaries to sell their products, result in loss of sales due to loss of market exclusivity, and require the payment of past damages and future royalties, and which may result in a non-cash impairment charge for any associated intangible asset. The most significant of these matters are described below. Medical Devices In January 2010, Tyco Healthcare Group, LP (Tyco) and U.S. Surgical Corporation (now Covidien plc) filed a lawsuit against Ethicon Endo-Surgery, Inc. (EES) in the United States District Court for the District of Connecticut alleging that EES's HARMONIC  shears infringed three Tyco patents. The case was tried in July 2012, and in March 2013, the Court ruled that some of EES's HARMONIC  shears infringed Tyco's patents and ordered EES to pay damages of approximately $176 million , but declined to order injunctive relief. EES appealed and in December 2014, the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit reversed the District Court's ruling and found all the asserted claims invalid. In July 2015, Tyco filed a motion for review with the United States Supreme Court. In July 2014, Covidien filed another patent infringement lawsuit against EES in the United States District Court for the District of Connecticut seeking damages and a preliminary injunction, alleging that EES's newest version of its harmonic scalpels, the HARMONIC ACE  + 7 Shears and the HARMONIC ACE  + Shears, infringed the three Tyco patents asserted in the previous case. The claims asserted by Covidien in this case are the same claims that were declared invalid in December 2014 by the Court of Appeals in the Tyco case discussed above. In November 2015, the United States Supreme Court denied Tyco's petition for review; therefore, both cases have been dismissed. In November 2007, Roche Diagnostics Operations, Inc., et al. (Roche) filed a patent infringement lawsuit against LifeScan, Inc. (LifeScan) in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware, alleging LifeScan's OneTouch  Line of Blood Glucose Monitoring Systems infringe two patents related to the use of microelectrode sensors. Roche is seeking monetary damages and injunctive relief. In September 2009, LifeScan obtained a favorable ruling on claim construction that precluded a finding of infringement. Roche appealed and the Court of Appeals reversed the District Court's ruling on claim construction and remanded the case to the District Court for new findings on the issue. In December 2014, the District Court ruled in LifeScan's favor and reinstated the original claim construction. In February 2015, Roche appealed the ruling, and in February 2016, oral argument took place at the Court of Appeals. The parties are awaiting a decision. In June 2009, Rembrandt Vision Technologies, L.P. (Rembrandt) filed a patent infringement lawsuit against Johnson  Johnson Vision Care, Inc. (JJVC) in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Texas alleging that JJVC's manufacture and sale of its ACUVUE  ADVANCE  and ACUVUE  OASYS  Hydrogel Contact Lenses infringe their U.S. Patent No. 5,712,327 (the '327 patent). Rembrandt is seeking monetary relief. The case was transferred to the United States District Court for the Middle District of Florida. In May 2012, the jury returned a verdict holding that neither of the accused lenses infringes the '327 patent. Rembrandt appealed, and in August 2013, the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit affirmed the District Court's judgment. Rembrandt asked the District Court to grant it a new trial based on alleged new evidence, and in July 2014, the District Court denied Rembrandts motion. Rembrandt has appealed the District Court's denial of its motion for a new trial. In December 2009, the State of Israel filed a lawsuit in the District Court in Tel Aviv Jaffa against Omrix Biopharmaceuticals, Inc. and various affiliates (Omrix). In the lawsuit, the State claims that an employee of a government-owned hospital was the inventor on several patents related to fibrin glue technology that the employee developed while he was a government employee. The State claims that he had no right to transfer any intellectual property to Omrix because it belongs to the State. The State is seeking damages plus royalties on QUIXIL and EVICEL  products, or alternatively, transfer of the patents to the State. The case remains active, but no trial date has been set. In September 2011, LifeScan, Inc. (LifeScan) filed a lawsuit against Shasta Technologies, LLC (Shasta), Instacare Corp (now Pharmatech Solutions, Inc. (Pharmatech)) and Conductive Technologies, Inc. (Conductive) in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California for patent infringement and false advertising for the making and marketing of a strip for use in LifeScan's OneTouch  Blood Glucose Meters. The defendants alleged that the three LifeScan patents-in-suit are invalid and challenged the validity of the asserted patents in the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO). In April  ##TABLE_START  ##TABLE_END 2013, the defendants brought counterclaims for alleged antitrust violations and false advertising and those claims were stayed pending resolution of the patent infringement case. The validity of two of the patents was confirmed by the USPTO, but the USPTO determined that the third patent, U.S. Patent No. 7,250,105 (the '105 patent), is invalid. LifeScan lost an appeal of that decision, but is seeking a rehearing. LifeScan entered into a settlement agreement with Shasta and Conductive. A motion brought by Pharmatech for summary judgment of patent invalidity was argued in February 2016 and the parties are awaiting a decision. LifeScan's patent infringement and false advertising claims are scheduled to be tried in August 2016. LifeScan filed a patent infringement lawsuit against UniStrip Technologies, LLC (UniStrip) in the United States District Court for the District of North Carolina in May 2014, alleging that the making and marketing of Unistrips strips infringe the same patents asserted against Shasta above. That case has been stayed pending the outcome of the appeal of the USPTO's decision on the validity of the '105 patent. In July 2014, UniStrip brought a lawsuit against LifeScan in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, alleging antitrust violations relating to marketing practices for LifeScan strips. In March 2013, Medinol Ltd. (Medinol) filed a patent infringement lawsuit against Cordis Corporation (Cordis) and Johnson  Johnson in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York alleging that all of Cordis's sales of the CYPHER  and CYPHER SELECT Stents made in the United States since 2005 willfully infringed four of Medinol's patents directed to the geometry of articulated stents. Medinol is seeking damages and attorney's fees. After trial in January 2014, the District Court dismissed the case, finding Medinol unreasonably delayed bringing its claims, and Medinol did not appeal the decision. In September 2014, the District Court denied a motion by Medinol to vacate the judgment and grant it a new trial. Medinol's appeal of this decision has been dismissed. Medinol has filed a petition for review with the United States Supreme Court. Following the divestiture of Cordis, the Company retains any liability that may result from this case. In December 2014, Bonutti Skeletal Innovations LLC (Bonutti) sued DePuy Synthes Sales, Inc. and DePuy Synthes Products, Inc. in the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts, alleging that DePuy Synthes's product line of spine implants infringes six patents owned by Bonutti, generally covering wedge implants and their methods of implantation. Bonutti is seeking monetary damages and injunctive relief. Pharmaceutical In 2012 and 2013, Noramco, Inc. (Noramco) moved to intervene in several patent infringement lawsuits filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York by Purdue Pharma L.P. and others (Purdue) against Noramco oxycodone customers, Impax Laboratories, Inc. (Impax), Teva Pharmaceuticals USA, Inc. (Teva), Amneal Pharmaceuticals, LLC (Amneal), Watson Laboratories, Inc.- Florida (Watson) and Andrx Labs, LLC (Andrx). The lawsuits are in response to the defendants' respective Abbreviated New Drug Applications seeking approval to market generic extended release oxycodone products before the expiration of certain Purdue patents. Three of the asserted patents relate to oxycodone and processes for making oxycodone, and Noramco has agreed to defend the lawsuits on behalf of Impax, Teva, Amneal, Watson, and Andrx. In April 2013, Watson and Andrx entered into a settlement with Purdue. The trial against Impax and Teva (and others) took place in September 2013, and Noramco defended Teva and Impax. In November 2013, Impax entered into a settlement with Purdue, and in December 2014, Teva entered into a settlement with Purdue. The District Court issued a decision in January 2014 invalidating the relevant Purdue patents and, based on that decision, subsequently dismissed the lawsuit against Amneal (and other parties not defended by Noramco). Purdue appealed the Court's decision. In February 2016, the Federal Circuit affirmed the District Court decision invalidating the Purdue patents. If Purdue ultimately prevails in its appeal of the invalidity decision, it can reinstitute its action against Amneal. In December 2015, Purdue filed another patent infringement action against Amneal in the District of Delaware asserting, among others, the three above-referenced patents and a newly issued patent relating to oxycodone and processes for making oxycodone. Johnson  Johnson acquired the prostate cancer business of Aragon Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Aragon), including ARN-509, a compound being tested for treatment of prostate cancer, in September 2013. Prior to the acquisition, in May 2011, Medivation, Inc. (Medivation) had sued Aragon and the University of California seeking rights to ARN-509. In December 2012, the State Court granted summary judgment to Aragon on Medivation's claims, awarding the rights of the ARN-509 compound to Aragon, and in January 2013, the Court dismissed the case against Aragon. Medivation has appealed.  ##TABLE_START  ##TABLE_END REMICADE  Related Cases In September 2013, JBI and NYU Langone Medical Center (NYU Medical Center) received an Office Action from the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) rejecting the claims in U.S. Patent No. 6,284,471 relating to REMICADE  (the '471 patent) in a reexamination proceeding instituted by a third party. The '471 patent is co-owned by JBI and NYU Medical Center, and NYU Medical Center granted JBI an exclusive license to NYU Medical Center's rights under the patent. Currently, the '471 patent in the United States expires in September 2018. JBI responded to that rejection in December 2013 and in August 2014, JBI and NYU Medical Center received a further rejection. JBI responded to the rejection by filing a further amendment and in November 2014, JBI's petition to enter the amendment was granted. The application was returned to the examiner for issuance of a new Office Action, which occurred in February 2015, further rejecting the patent. JBI responded to that rejection and in April 2015, the USPTO issued a further action maintaining its rejection of the '471 patent. In May 2015, JBI filed a notice of appeal to the USPTO's Patent Trial and Appeal Board, and the appeal is currently pending. The '471 patent remains a valid and enforceable patent as it undergoes reexamination at the USPTO. JBI will continue to defend the patent and, if necessary, will pursue all available appeals. In August 2014, Celltrion filed for FDA approval to make and sell its own biosimilar version of REMICADE  . In March 2015, JBI filed a lawsuit in the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts against Celltrion and Hospira seeking a declaratory judgment that their biosimilar product for which they are seeking FDA approval under the new Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act (the BPCIA) infringes or potentially infringes six JBI patents. JBI is also seeking a declaratory judgment that defendants have failed to comply with certain procedural requirements of the BPCIA. In addition, JBI has moved for a preliminary and permanent injunction to prohibit Celltrion and Hospira from launching their biosimilar product until 180 days after they have given JBI a Notice of Commercial Marketing, such notice not to be given before FDA approval of Celltrion's product. Also in March 2015, JBI moved to stay all proceedings in the District Court with respect to the 471 patent, pending the USPTO re-examination proceeding. In August 2015, JBI also filed a motion seeking the District Court's permission to file a patent infringement lawsuit asserting U.S. Patent No. 7,598,083 (the '083 patent) against Celltrion and the manufacturer of the cell culture media that Celltrion uses to make its biosimilar product. Although the '083 patent is already asserted in the existing lawsuit, this would expand the claims to include any use of the cell media made in the United States to manufacture Celltrion's biosimilar. In February 2016, Celltrion and Hospira agreed not to launch their biosimilar product before June 30, 2016 and the '471 and '083 patents will be the two remaining patents in the lawsuit. In light of this representation, and because the Federal Circuit Court of Appeals is expected to decide this issue in an unrelated but similar case before June 29th, the Court denied JBI's motion for preliminary injunction, but noted that JBI may renew its motion following the Court of Appeals decision, if necessary, or if the Court of Appeals fails to decide the issue by June 29th. In addition, in February 2016, Celltrion and Hospira filed a motion for summary judgment of invalidity of the 471 patent. In March 2013, Hospira Healthcare Corporation (Hospira) filed an impeachment proceeding against The Kennedy Institute of Rheumatology (Kennedy) challenging the validity of a Canadian patent related to REMICADE  (a Feldman patent), which is exclusively licensed to Janssen Biotech, Inc. (JBI). In October 2013, Kennedy, along with JBI, Janssen Inc. and Cilag GmbH International (both affiliates of JBI), filed a counterclaim for infringement against Celltrion Healthcare Co., Ltd., Celltrion Inc. (together, Celltrion) and Hospira. The counterclaim alleges that the products described in Celltrions and Hospiras marketing applications to Health Canada for their subsequent entry biologics (SEB) to REMICADE  would infringe the Feldman patents owned by Kennedy. Discovery in the patent action is ongoing. Trial has been scheduled for September 2016. In January 2014, Health Canada approved Celltrions SEB to REMICADE  , allowing Celltrion to market its biosimilar version of REMICADE  in Canada, regardless of the pending patent action. In June 2014, Hospira received approval for its SEB to REMICADE  . In July 2014, Janssen Inc. (Janssen) filed a lawsuit to compel the Canadian Minister of Health to withdraw the Notice of Compliance for Hospiras SEB because Hospira did not serve a Notice of Allegation on Janssen to address the patent listed by Janssen on the Patent Register. In March 2015, the parties entered into a settlement agreement whereby Health Canada agreed to a Consent Judgment setting aside Hospiras Notice of Compliance, subject to Health Canada's right to appeal, which appeal was filed in June 2015. Nevertheless, Hospira began marketing a biosimilar version of REMICADE  as a distributor under Celltrion's Notice of Compliance. If any of the REMICADE  related patents discussed above is found to be invalid, any such patent could not be relied upon to prevent the introduction of biosimilar versions of REMICADE  . Biosimilar versions of REMICADE  have been introduced in certain markets outside the United States, resulting in a reduction in sales of REMICADE  in those markets. The timing of the possible introduction of a biosimilar version of REMICADE  in the United States is subject to enforcement of patent rights, approval by the FDA and compliance with the 180-day notice provisions of the BPCIA. In February 2016, the Arthritis Advisory Committee of the FDA recommended approval of Celltrions investigational biosimilar version of  ##TABLE_START  ##TABLE_END REMICADE  by a vote of 21-3 across all eligible indications in the United States. There is a risk that a competitor could launch a biosimilar version of REMICADE  following FDA approval (subject to compliance with the 180-day notice provisions of the BPCIA), even though one or more valid patents are in place. Introduction to the U.S. market of a biosimilar version of REMICADE  will result in a reduction in U.S. sales of REMICADE  . Litigation Against Filers of Abbreviated New Drug Applications (ANDAs) The following summarizes lawsuits pending against generic companies that have filed Abbreviated New Drug Applications (ANDAs) with the FDA, or undertaken similar regulatory processes outside of the United States, seeking to market generic forms of products sold by various subsidiaries of Johnson  Johnson prior to expiration of the applicable patents covering those products. These ANDAs typically include allegations of non-infringement, invalidity and unenforceability of the applicable patents. In the event the subsidiaries are not successful in these actions, or the statutory 30-month stays of the ANDAs expire before the United States District Court rulings are obtained, the third-party companies involved will have the ability, upon approval of the FDA, to introduce generic versions of the products at issue to the market, resulting in the potential for substantial market share and revenue losses for those products, and which may result in a non-cash impairment charge in any associated intangible asset. In addition, from time to time, subsidiaries may settle these actions and such settlements can involve the introduction of generic versions of the products at issue to the market prior to the expiration of the relevant patents. PREZISTA   A number of generic companies have filed ANDAs seeking approval to market generic versions of PREZISTA  . In November 2010, Tibotec, Inc. (now Tibotec, LLC) and Tibotec Pharmaceuticals (now Janssen RD Ireland) (collectively, Tibotec) filed a patent infringement lawsuit against Lupin, Ltd., Lupin Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (collectively, Lupin), Mylan, Inc. and Mylan Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (collectively, Mylan) in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey in response to Lupin's and Mylan's respective ANDAs seeking approval to market generic versions of Tibotec's PREZISTA  product before the expiration of Tibotec's patent relating to PREZISTA  . Lupin and Mylan each filed counterclaims alleging non-infringement and invalidity. In July 2011, Tibotec filed another patent infringement lawsuit against Lupin in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey in response to Lupin's supplement to its ANDA to add new dosage strengths for its proposed product. In August 2011, Tibotec and G.D. Searle  Company (G.D. Searle) filed a patent infringement lawsuit against Lupin and Mylan in response to their notice letters advising that their ANDAs are seeking approval to market generic versions of Tibotec's PREZISTA  product before the expiration of two additional patents relating to PREZISTA  that Tibotec exclusively licenses from G.D. Searle. In September 2011, the Court consolidated the above lawsuits (referred to here as the First Consolidated Action). The approved New Drug Application for PREZISTA  was transferred from Tibotec, Inc. to Janssen Products, LP in December 2011. In 2012 and 2013, Janssen Products, LP and Janssen RD Ireland (collectively, Janssen) added several patents that they own or exclusively license from G.D. Searle to the First Consolidated Action against Mylan and Lupin. In June 2013, Janssen and G.D. Searle dismissed their claims relating to the patents owned by G.D. Searle against Lupin and Mylan, based on those parties agreement not to seek FDA approval of their respective ANDAs until the November 2017 expiration of the G.D. Searle patents. After a trial regarding the remaining patents in the First Consolidated Action, the Court issued a decision in August 2014 in favor of Janssen, holding that the asserted patents are valid and would be infringed by Lupin's and Mylan's marketing of their proposed products. Mylan and Lupin filed an appeal. In July 2014, Janssen filed a patent infringement lawsuit against Mylan in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey, alleging infringement of United States Patent No. 8,153,829. In November 2015, Janssen and Mylan entered into a confidential settlement. Pursuant to the settlement agreement, the parties are in the process of seeking a dismissal of this action. In addition, the appeal of the August 2014 decision as it relates to Mylan has been dismissed and remanded to the District Court where the parties are seeking a modification of the Courts 2014 order in accordance with the settlement agreement. In May 2013, Lupin notified Janssen that it filed an ANDA seeking approval to market a new dosage strength of its generic version of PREZISTA  . In response, Janssen filed a patent infringement lawsuit in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey, alleging that Lupin's new dosage strength would infringe the same patents that Janssen is asserting against Lupin in the original action. In March 2014, Janssen filed a patent infringement lawsuit against Lupin in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey, alleging infringement of United States Patent No 8,518,987 (the 987 patent). In January 2015, the Court consolidated these lawsuits (referred to here as the Second Consolidated Action), and stayed them pending Lupin's appeal of the Court's decision in the First Consolidated Action. In April 2015, Lupin filed an Inter  ##TABLE_START  ##TABLE_END Partes Review in the USPTO seeking to invalidate the 987 patent and in October 2015, the USPTO denied Lupin's petition. In January 2016, Janssen received a patent notice from Lupin advising that Lupin has amended its ANDA to reflect a new formulation of darunavir that Lupin alleges does not infringe the relevant Janssen patents, and in February 2016, Janssen filed a lawsuit asserting those patents against Lupin in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey. In addition, in January 2016, Lupin filed a motion to stay and deactivate its appeal of the above-referenced August 2014 decision, and to remand the matter to the District Court where Lupin intends to modify the 2014 District Court order and injunction to allow Lupin to market its new formulation of darunavir before the expiration of the relevant patents. Janssen filed a patent infringement lawsuit against Hetero Drugs, Ltd. Unit III and Hetero USA Inc. in March 2013 in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey, alleging infringement of United States Patent Nos. 7,126,015 and 7,595,408. In October 2015, the parties stipulated to a Consent Judgment wherein the Hetero defendants admitted that the patents-in-suit are valid and would be infringed by the manufacture, importation, use or sale of Heteros ANDA product, and agreed to an injunction with respect to such product during the life of the patents-in-suit. Hetero reserved the right to develop non-infringing darunavir products and processes. In August 2014, Janssen filed patent infringement lawsuits against Cipla Ltd. and Cipla USA, Inc. (collectively, Cipla) in the United States District Courts for the Districts of New Jersey and Delaware in response to Ciplas ANDA seeking approval to market a generic version of Janssens PREZISTA  product before the expiration of certain of Janssens patents relating to PREZISTA  . Cipla filed counterclaims seeking declarations of noninfringement and invalidity of the patents-in-suit. In May 2015, Janssen and Cipla entered into a settlement agreement. In response to its Notice of Allegation seeking approval to market a generic version of PREZISTA  in Canada before the expiration of Canadian Patent No. 2,485,834, Janssen Inc. and Janssen RD Ireland filed a Notice of Application against Mylan Pharmaceuticals ULC in July 2014. In December 2014, Janssen RD Ireland transferred its PREZISTA  patents to Janssen Sciences Ireland UC, and Janssen Sciences Ireland UC was substituted for Janssen RD Ireland as plaintiff in the above-referenced actions. In February 2016, the parties entered into a confidential settlement and the Notice of Application has been dismissed. In January 2015, Janssen Inc. and Janssen Sciences Ireland UC filed a Notice of Application against Teva Canada Limited in response to its Notice of Allegation seeking approval to market a generic version of PREZISTA  before the expiration of Canadian Patent No. 2,485,834. In October 2015, the parties entered into a settlement wherein Teva Canada Limited agreed to withdraw its Notice of Allegation without prejudice to file a new one in the future, and Janssen Inc. and Janssen Sciences Ireland UC agreed to dismiss their Notice of Application. In each of the above lawsuits, Janssen sought or is seeking an Order enjoining the defendants from marketing their generic versions of PREZISTA  before the expiration of the relevant patents. CONCERTA   In May 2014, ALZA Corporation (ALZA) and Janssen Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (JPI) filed a patent infringement lawsuit in the United States District Court for the District of West Virginia against Mylan, Inc. and Mylan Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Mylan) in response to its ANDA seeking approval to market a generic version of CONCERTA  before the expiration of United States Patent No. 8,163,798 (the '798 patent). Mylan filed counterclaims seeking declarations of invalidity and non-infringement of the patents-in-suit. In May 2015, Mylan sought leave to add a counterclaim for invalidity and non-infringement of U.S. Patent No. 8,629,179 (the '179 patent) and the Court denied Mylan's motion. In July 2015, Mylan filed a declaratory judgment action in the Eastern District of Pennsylvania seeking a declaration of invalidity and non-infringement of the '179 patent. In October 2015, the parties entered into a confidential settlement of both the West Virginia and Pennsylvania actions. In December 2014, Janssen Inc. and ALZA filed a Notice of Application against Actavis Pharma Company (Actavis) in response to its Notice of Allegation seeking approval to market a generic version of CONCERTA  before the expiration of Canadian Patent No. 2,264,852 (the 852 patent). The hearing is scheduled for September 2016. In February 2015, Janssen Inc. and ALZA filed a Notice of Application against Apotex Inc. (Apotex) in response to its Notice of Allegation seeking approval to market a generic version of CONCERTA  before the expiration of the '852 patent. In August 2015, Janssen Inc. and ALZA voluntarily dismissed the Notice of Application. In each of the above lawsuits, ALZA and/or JPI sought or are seeking an Order enjoining the defendants from marketing their generic versions of CONCERTA  before the expiration of the relevant patents.  ##TABLE_START  ##TABLE_END ZYTIGA   In June and July 2015, Janssen Biotech, Inc. (JBI) received notices of paragraph IV certification from several companies advising of their respective ANDAs seeking approval for a generic version of ZYTIGA  before the expiration of one or more patents relating to ZYTIGA  . In July 2015, JBI, Janssen Oncology, Inc. and Janssen Research  Development, LLC (collectively, Janssen) and BTG International Ltd. (BTG) filed a patent infringement lawsuit in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey against several generic ANDA applicants (and certain of their affiliates and/or suppliers) in response to their respective ANDAs seeking approval to market a generic version of ZYTIGA  before the expiration of United States Patent Nos. 5,604,213 (the '213 patent) (expiring December 2016) and/or 8,822,438 (the '438 patent) (expiring August 2027). The generic companies include Actavis Laboratories, FL, Inc. (Actavis); Amneal Pharmaceuticals, LLC and Amneal Pharmaceuticals of New York, LLC (collectively, Amneal); Apotex Inc. and Apotex Corp. (collectively, Apotex); Citron Pharma LLC (Citron); Dr. Reddys Laboratories, Ltd. and Dr. Reddys Laboratories, Inc. (collectively, Dr. Reddy's); Mylan Pharmaceuticals Inc. and Mylan Inc. (collectively, Mylan); Par Pharmaceuticals, Inc. and Par Pharmaceutical Companies, Inc. (collectively, Par); Sun Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd. and Sun Pharmaceuticals Industries, Inc. (collectively, Sun); Teva Pharmaceuticals USA, Inc. (Teva); Wockhardt Bio A.G.; Wockhardt USA LLC and Wockhardt Ltd. (collectively, Wockhardt); West-Ward Pharmaceutical Corp. (West-Ward); and Hikma Pharmaceuticals, LLC (Hikma). The Court entered a stay of the New Jersey lawsuit against each of Par and Citron, as each agreed to be bound by the decision against the other defendants in the New Jersey action. In February 2016, the New Jersey Court set a trial date of October 2017. In August 2015, Janssen and BTG filed an additional jurisdictional protective lawsuit against the Mylan defendants in the United States District Court for the Northern District of West Virginia. In October 2015, Mylan filed a motion to dismiss the New Jersey lawsuit for lack of personal jurisdiction and improper venue. In February 2016, the West Virginia Court stayed the West Virginia case pending a decision on Mylan's motion to dismiss in the New Jersey lawsuit, but set a conditional trial date of February 2018. The Court will dismiss the West Virginia lawsuit if Mylan's motion to dismiss in New Jersey is denied. In August 2015, JBI received a notice of paragraph IV certification from Hetero USA Inc., the U.S. Regulatory Agent for Hetero Labs Limited Unit-V, a division of Hetero Labs Limited (collectively, Hetero) advising of Heteros ANDA seeking approval for a generic version of ZYTIGA  before expiration of the '438 patent. In September 2015, Janssen and BTG filed an amended complaint in the New Jersey lawsuit to allege infringement of the '438 patent by Hetero. The filing of the above-referenced lawsuits triggered a stay until October 2018 during which the FDA will not grant final approval of the generics' ANDAs unless there is an earlier district court decision finding the patents-in-suit invalid or not infringed. In December 2015, Amerigen Pharmaceuticals Limited filed a petition for an Inter Partes Review in the USPTO seeking to invalidate the '438 patent. In each of the above lawsuits, Janssen is seeking an Order enjoining the defendants from marketing their generic versions of ZYTIGA  before the expiration of the relevant patents. COMPLERA   In August and September 2015, Janssen Pharmaceutica NV and Janssen Sciences Ireland UC (collectively, Janssen) and Gilead Sciences, Inc. and Gilead Sciences Ireland UC (collectively, Gilead) filed patent infringement lawsuits in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware and West Virginia against Mylan, Inc. and Mylan Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (collectively, Mylan) in response to their ANDA seeking approval to market a generic version of COMPLERA  before the expiration of United States Patent Nos. 8,841,310; 7,125,879; and 8,101,629. In September 2015, Mylan filed an Answer in the West Virginia action that included counterclaims seeking declarations of invalidity and non-infringement of the patents-in-suit as well as United States Patent No. 8,080,551. In September 2015, Mylan filed a motion to dismiss the Delaware lawsuit for lack of personal jurisdiction. In January 2016, Janssen and Gilead filed a first amended complaint in the New Jersey Action adding claims for patent infringement with respect to United States Patent Nos. 7,399,856 and 7,563,922. In addition, in the New Jersey Action, the Court dismissed Mylans motion to dismiss and set a trial date of February 2018, and in the West Virginia Action, the Court set a trial date of December 2017. In February 2016, Mylan renewed its motion to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction. In each of the above lawsuits, Janssen is seeking an Order enjoining the defendants from marketing their generic versions of COMPLERA  before the expiration of the relevant patents.  ##TABLE_START  ##TABLE_END XARELTO   A number of generic companies have filed ANDAs seeking approval to market generic versions of XARELTO  . In October 2015, Janssen Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (JPI) and Bayer Pharma AG and Bayer Intellectual Property GmbH (collectively, Bayer) filed a patent infringement lawsuit against Aurobindo Pharma Limited, Aurobindo Pharma USA, Inc., Breckenridge Pharmaceutical, Inc., Micro Labs USA Inc., Micro Labs Ltd., Mylan Pharmaceuticals Inc., Mylan Inc., Prinston Pharmaceutical, Inc., Sigmapharm Laboratories, LLC, Torrent Pharmaceuticals, Limited and Torrent Pharma Inc. in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware in response to those parties respective ANDAs seeking approval to market generic versions of XARELTO  before the expiration of Bayers United States Patent Nos. 7,157,456, 7,585,860 and 7,592,339 relating to XARELTO  . JPI is the exclusive licensee of the asserted patents. JPI is seeking an Order enjoining the defendants from marketing their generic versions of XARELTO  before the expiration of the relevant patents. In November 2015, Mylan moved to dismiss the action. In December 2015, JPI, Bayer, and Mylan stipulated and agreed to dismiss the claims against Mylan Inc. and suspend further briefing and argument on Mylan's motion to dismiss pending appeals relating to personal jurisdiction over Mylan Pharmaceuticals Inc. in the District of Delaware. In January 2016, JPI and Bayer received a paragraph IV notice from Invagen Pharmaceuticals Inc. (Invagen) advising that it is seeking FDA approval for a generic XARELTO  product before expiration of the relevant patents. In February 2016, JPI and Bayer filed a patent infringement action against Invagen asserting the same XARELTO  patents asserted in the original case, and the Invagen case has been consolidated with the original case. The Court set a trial date of March 2018. GOVERNMENT PROCEEDINGS Like other companies in the pharmaceutical and medical devices industries, Johnson  Johnson and certain of its subsidiaries are subject to extensive regulation by national, state and local government agencies in the United States and other countries in which they operate. As a result, interaction with government agencies is ongoing. The most significant litigation brought by, and investigations conducted by, government agencies are listed below. It is possible that criminal charges and substantial fines and/or civil penalties or damages could result from government investigations or litigation. Average Wholesale Price (AWP) Litigation Johnson  Johnson and several of its pharmaceutical subsidiaries (the JJ AWP Defendants), along with numerous other pharmaceutical companies, are defendants in a series of lawsuits in state and federal courts involving allegations that the pricing and marketing of certain pharmaceutical products amounted to fraudulent and otherwise actionable conduct because, among other things, the companies allegedly reported an inflated Average Wholesale Price (AWP) for the drugs at issue. Payors alleged that they used those AWPs in calculating provider reimbursement levels. Many of these cases, both federal actions and state actions removed to federal court, were consolidated for pre-trial purposes in a Multi-District Litigation (MDL) in the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts. The plaintiffs in these cases included three classes of private persons or entities that paid for any portion of the purchase of the drugs at issue based on AWP, and state government entities that made Medicaid payments for the drugs at issue based on AWP. In June 2007, after a trial on the merits, the MDL Court dismissed the claims of two of the plaintiff classes against the JJ AWP Defendants. In March 2011, the Court dismissed the claims of the third class against the JJ AWP Defendants without prejudice. AWP cases brought by various Attorneys General have proceeded to trial against other manufacturers. Several state cases against certain subsidiaries of Johnson  Johnson have been settled, including the case in Alaska, which settled in April 2014, and cases are still pending in Illinois, New Jersey, Wisconsin and Utah. The cases in Illinois, New Jersey and Wisconsin have not yet proceeded to trial. In Utah, the claims brought by the Attorney General were dismissed by the Court in 2013, but the State may appeal the dismissal after the conclusion of similar pending matters against other defendants. The AWP case against the JJ AWP Defendants brought by the Attorney General of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania was tried in Commonwealth Court in 2010. The Court found in the Commonwealth's favor with regard to certain of its claims under the Pennsylvania Unfair Trade Practices and Consumer Protection Law (UTPL), entered an injunction, and awarded $45 million in restitution and $6.5 million in civil penalties. The Court found in the JJ AWP Defendants' favor on the Commonwealth's claims of unjust enrichment, misrepresentation/fraud, civil conspiracy, and on certain of the Commonwealth's claims under the UTPL. The JJ AWP Defendants appealed the Commonwealth Court's UTPL ruling, and in June 2014, the Pennsylvania Supreme Court  ##TABLE_START  ##TABLE_END vacated the judgment entered by the Commonwealth Court and remanded the case for further proceedings. On remand, in January 2015, the Commonwealth Court dismissed the monetary awards against the JJ AWP Defendants. In March 2015, the ruling was appealed back to the Pennsylvania Supreme Court. In December 2015, the Pennsylvania Supreme Court affirmed the Order of the Commonwealth Court dismissing the monetary awards against the JJ AWP Defendants. RISPERDAL   In November 2013, Johnson  Johnson and its subsidiary, Janssen Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (JPI), finalized previously disclosed settlement agreements with the United States Department of Justice and forty-five states resolving federal investigations and state Medicaid claims related to past promotional practices of RISPERDAL  from 1999 through 2005, and other matters. JPI had also settled alleged consumer fraud claims in connection with the sale and marketing of RISPERDAL  with thirty-six states and the District of Columbia in September 2012. In addition to these actions, the Attorneys General of several states brought actions against JPI, related to the sale and marketing of RISPERDAL  , seeking one or more of the following remedies: reimbursement of Medicaid or other public funds for RISPERDAL  prescriptions written for off-label use, compensation for treating their citizens for alleged adverse reactions to RISPERDAL  , civil fines or penalties for violations of state false claims acts or consumer fraud statutes, punitive damages, or other relief relating to alleged unfair business practices. Certain of these actions also sought injunctive relief relating to the promotion of RISPERDAL  . Many of the actions and claims brought by the state Attorneys General have been settled, either individually or as part of the settlements described above. The cases brought by the Attorneys General of Mississippi and Kentucky were settled in December 2015, without any admission of wrongdoing on the part of JPI. State cases that went to judgment after trial are discussed below. In 2004, the Attorney General of West Virginia commenced a lawsuit against Janssen Pharmaceutica, Inc. (now JPI) based on claims of alleged consumer fraud as to DURAGESIC  , as well as RISPERDAL  . JPI was found liable and damages were assessed at $4.5 million . JPI filed an appeal, and in November 2010, the West Virginia Supreme Court of Appeals reversed the trial court's decision. In December 2010, the Attorney General of West Virginia dismissed the case as it related to RISPERDAL  without any payment. Thereafter, JPI settled the case insofar as it related to DURAGESIC  . In 2004, the Attorney General of Louisiana filed a multi-count Complaint against Janssen Pharmaceutica, Inc. (now JPI). Johnson  Johnson was later added as a defendant. The case was tried in October 2010. The issue tried to the jury was whether Johnson  Johnson or JPI had violated the State's Medical Assistance Program Integrity Law (the Act) through misrepresentations allegedly made in the mailing of a November 2003 Dear Health Care Professional letter regarding RISPERDAL  . The jury returned a verdict that JPI and Johnson  Johnson had violated the Act and awarded $257.7 million in damages. The trial judge subsequently awarded the Attorney General counsel fees and expenses in the amount of $73 million . In January 2014, the Louisiana Supreme Court reversed the District Courts judgment in favor of the Attorney General, and rendered judgment in favor of Johnson  Johnson and JPI. In April 2014, the Louisiana Supreme Court denied the Attorney General's petition seeking a rehearing of the appellate arguments, resulting in final dismissal of the case. In 2007, the Office of General Counsel of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania filed a lawsuit against Janssen Pharmaceutica, Inc. (now JPI) on a multi-Count Complaint related to Janssen Pharmaceutica's sale of RISPERDAL  to the Commonwealth's Medicaid program. The trial occurred in June 2010. The trial judge dismissed the case after the close of the plaintiff's evidence. The Commonwealth filed an appeal and in July 2012, the Pennsylvania Appeals Court upheld the dismissal of the Commonwealth's case. In 2007, the Attorney General of South Carolina filed a lawsuit against Johnson  Johnson and Janssen Pharmaceutica, Inc. (now JPI) on several counts. In March 2011, the matter was tried to a jury on liability only, at which time the lawsuit was limited to claims of violation of the South Carolina Unfair Trade Practices Act, including, among others, questions of whether Johnson  Johnson or JPI engaged in unfair or deceptive acts or practices in the conduct of any trade or commerce by distributing the November 2003 Dear Health Care Professional letter regarding RISPERDAL  or in their use of the product's FDA-approved label. The jury found in favor of Johnson  Johnson and against JPI. In June 2011, the Court awarded civil penalties of approximately $327.1 million against JPI. JPI appealed this judgment and in February 2015, the South Carolina Supreme Court affirmed the trial courts decision in part, reversed it in part and remanded the case back to the trial court. The net effect of the decision was to reduce the judgment to approximately $136 million , plus interest. In the first fiscal quarter of 2015, the Company accrued $136 million . In March 2015, JPI filed a Petition for Rehearing. In July 2015, the South Carolina Supreme Court granted the Petition and filed a substituted opinion. The new opinion reduced the judgment from approximately $136 million to approximately $124 million . In January 2016, the United States Supreme Court denied JPI's request for review, putting an end to this case.  ##TABLE_START  ##TABLE_END In April 2012, in the lawsuit brought by the Attorney General of Arkansas, the jury found against both JPI and Johnson  Johnson, and the Court imposed penalties in the amount of approximately $1.2 billion . In January 2013, the trial court awarded attorney fees of approximately $181 million . JPI and Johnson  Johnson appealed both awards to the Arkansas Supreme Court, and in March 2014, the Arkansas Supreme Court dismissed the States claim under the Arkansas Medicaid Fraud False Claims Act, as well as the approximately $1.2 billion in penalties, and reversed and remanded a claim under the Arkansas Deceptive Trade Practices Act. In April 2014, the Arkansas Supreme Court rejected a petition by the State for rehearing on the case. In May 2015, the matter settled for $7.75 million . McNeil Consumer Healthcare Starting in June 2010, McNeil Consumer Healthcare Division of McNEIL-PPC, Inc. (now Johnson  Johnson Consumer Inc., McNeil Consumer Healthcare Division) (McNeil Consumer Healthcare) and certain affiliates, including Johnson  Johnson (the Companies), received grand jury subpoenas from the United States Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania requesting documents broadly relating to recalls of various products of McNeil Consumer Healthcare, and the FDA inspections of the Fort Washington, Pennsylvania and Lancaster, Pennsylvania manufacturing facilities, as well as certain documents relating to recalls of a small number of products of other subsidiaries. In addition, in February 2011, the government served McNEIL-PPC, Inc. (McNEIL-PPC) with a Civil Investigative Demand seeking records relevant to its investigation to determine if there was a violation of the Federal False Claims Act. In March 2015, McNEIL-PPC entered a guilty plea in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania to a misdemeanor violation of the U.S. Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act. McNEIL- PPC agreed to pay a $20 million fine and a $5 million forfeiture to resolve the matter. The Companies have also received Civil Investigative Demands from multiple State Attorneys General Offices broadly relating to the McNeil recall issues. The Companies continue to cooperate with these inquiries, which are being coordinated through a multi-state coalition. If a resolution cannot be reached with this multi-state coalition, it is possible that individual State Attorneys General Offices may file civil monetary claims against the Companies. In January 2011, the Oregon Attorney General filed a civil complaint against Johnson  Johnson, McNEIL-PPC and McNeil Healthcare LLC in state court alleging civil violations of the Oregon Unlawful Trade Practices Act relating to an earlier recall of a McNeil OTC product. In November 2012, the state court granted a motion by the Companies to dismiss Oregon's complaint in its entirety, with prejudice, and Oregon appealed that decision. In November 2015, the Court of Appeals of the State of Oregon reversed the trial court and reinstated Oregon's consumer protection claims. In December 2015, the Companies filed a petition for review with the Oregon Supreme Court. Opioids Litigation Along with other pharmaceutical companies, Johnson  Johnson (JJ) and Janssen Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (JPI) have been named in two lawsuits alleging claims related to marketing of opioids, including DURAGESIC  , NUCYNTA  and NUCYNTA  ER. In May 2014, Santa Clara and Orange Counties in California (the Counties) filed a complaint in state court in Orange County, California against numerous pharmaceutical manufacturers, including JJ and JPI, alleging claims related to opioid marketing practices, including false advertising, unfair competition, and public nuisance. The Counties seek injunctive and monetary relief. In February 2015, the defendants filed motions challenging the sufficiency of the complaint. In August 2015, the Court stayed the case until the FDA concludes its ongoing inquiry into the safety and effectiveness of long-term opioid treatment. In June 2014, the City of Chicago filed a complaint in Cook County Circuit Court against the same group of pharmaceutical manufacturers, including JJ and JPI, alleging a number of claims related to opioid marketing practices, including consumer fraud violations and false claims, and seeking injunctive and monetary relief. The case was later removed to the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois, and in December 2014, JJ and JPI filed a motion to dismiss the City of Chicago's First Amended Complaint for failure to state a claim. In November 2015, JJ and JPI filed a motion to dismiss the City of Chicago's Second Amended Complaint for failure to state a claim. In September 2014, the Tennessee Attorney General Division of Consumer Affairs issued a Request for Information to JPI and other pharmaceutical companies related to opioids marketing practices. In August 2015, the New Hampshire Attorney General, Consumer Protection and Antitrust Bureau issued a subpoena to JPI and other pharmaceutical companies related to opioids marketing practices. JPI objected to private contingent fee counsels participation in the investigation on the States behalf, and in October 2015, the State moved to enforce the subpoena.  ##TABLE_START  ##TABLE_END In December 2015, the State of Mississippi filed a complaint in the Chancery Court of the First Judicial District of Hinds County against the same group of pharmaceutical manufacturers, including JJ and JPI, alleging a number of claims related to opioid marketing practices. The State of Mississippi is seeking penalties and injunctive and monetary relief. Other In September 2011, Synthes, Inc. (Synthes) received a Civil Investigative Demand issued pursuant to the False Claims Act from the United States Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania. The Demand sought information regarding allegations that fellowships had been offered to hospitals in exchange for agreements to purchase products. Synthes has produced documents and information in response to the Demand and is cooperating with the inquiry. In May 2012, Acclarent, Inc. (Acclarent) received a subpoena from the United States Attorney's Office for the District of Massachusetts requesting documents broadly relating to the sales, marketing and alleged off-label promotion by Acclarent of the RELIEVA STRATUS  MicroFlow Spacer product (the STRATUS  Spacer). In April 2015, an Indictment was filed in the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts charging the former President/CEO and Vice President of Sales of Acclarent (the former Acclarent officers). The Indictment charges the former Acclarent officers with various violations related to the off-label promotion of the STRATUS  Spacer. The allegations against the former Acclarent officers relate to the development, sale and marketing of the STRATUS  Spacer, as well as actions allegedly taken by the former Acclarent officers in connection with the acquisition of Acclarent by Ethicon, Inc. in 2010. There are no charges against Acclarent, Ethicon, Inc. or Johnson  Johnson. In August 2012, DePuy Orthopaedics, Inc., DePuy, Inc. (now DePuy Synthes, Inc.), and Johnson  Johnson Services, Inc. (the Companies) received an informal request from the United States Attorney's Office for the District of Massachusetts and the Civil Division of the United States Department of Justice (the United States) for the production of materials relating to the ASR XL Hip device. In July 2014, the United States notified the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts that it had declined to intervene in a qui tam case filed pursuant to the False Claims Act against the Companies. The District Court issued an order in August 2014 that publicly unsealed the United States' declination notice; however, the complaint in the matter remains under seal. In addition, in October 2013, a group of state Attorneys General issued Civil Investigative Demands relating to the development, sales and marketing of several of DePuy Orthopaedics, Inc.s hip products. In July 2014, the Oregon Department of Justice, which was investigating these matters independently of the other states, announced a settlement of its ASR XL Hip device investigation for a total payment of $4 million to the State of Oregon. In October 2012, Johnson  Johnson was contacted by the California Attorney General's office regarding a multi-state Attorney General investigation of the marketing of surgical mesh products for hernia and urogynecological purposes by Johnson  Johnson's subsidiary, Ethicon, Inc. (Ethicon). Johnson  Johnson and Ethicon have since entered into a series of tolling agreements with the 47 states and the District of Columbia participating in the multi-state investigation and have responded to Civil Investigative Demands served by certain of the participating states. The states are seeking monetary and injunctive relief. In December 2012, Therakos, Inc. (Therakos), formerly a subsidiary of Johnson  Johnson and part of the Ortho-Clinical Diagnostics, Inc. (OCD) franchise, received a letter from the civil division of the United States Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania informing Therakos that the United States Attorney's Office was investigating the sales and marketing of Uvadex  (methoxsalen) and the Uvar Xts  System during the period 2000 to the present. The United States Attorney's Office requested that OCD and Johnson  Johnson preserve documents that could relate to the investigation. Therakos was subsequently acquired by an affiliate of Gores Capital Partners III, L.P. in January 2013. OCD and Johnson  Johnson retain certain liabilities that may result from the investigation for activity that occurred prior to the sale of Therakos. In March 2014, the United States Attorneys Office requested that Johnson  Johnson produce certain documents, and Johnson  Johnson is cooperating with the request. Following the divestiture of OCD, Johnson  Johnson retains OCDs portion of any liability that may result from the investigation for activity that occurred prior to the sale of Therakos. In recent years, Johnson  Johnson has received numerous requests from a variety of United States Congressional Committees to produce information relevant to ongoing congressional inquiries. It is the policy of Johnson  Johnson to cooperate with these inquiries by producing the requested information.  ##TABLE_START  ##TABLE_END GENERAL LITIGATION In September 2006, Johnson  Johnson filed a lawsuit against Guidant Corporation (Guidant) in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, alleging that Guidant breached provisions of a merger agreement between Johnson  Johnson and Guidant. In June 2011, Guidant filed a motion for summary judgment and in July 2014, the judge denied Guidants motion. The trial concluded in January 2015 and in February 2015, before a decision was issued by the Court, Johnson  Johnson and Guidant entered into a settlement agreement, pursuant to which Guidant agreed to pay Johnson  Johnson $600 million and agreed that it will not sue Johnson  Johnson or its affiliates for patent infringement regarding certain stent products. Johnson  Johnson dismissed its action against Guidant with prejudice. The Company recorded a gain associated with this transaction in fiscal first quarter of 2015. In June 2009, following the public announcement that Ortho-Clinical Diagnostics, Inc. (OCD) had received a grand jury subpoena from the United States Department of Justice, Antitrust Division, in connection with an investigation that has since been closed, multiple class action complaints were filed against OCD by direct purchasers seeking damages for alleged price fixing. These cases were consolidated for pre-trial purposes in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania as In re Blood Reagent Antitrust Litigation . Following the divestiture of OCD, Johnson  Johnson retains any liability that may result from these cases. In August 2012, the District Court granted a motion filed by Plaintiffs for class certification. In April 2015, the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit reversed the class certification ruling and remanded the case to the District Court for further proceedings. In October 2015, the District Court again granted the motion by Plaintiffs for class certification. In September 2011, Johnson  Johnson, Johnson  Johnson Inc. and McNeil Consumer Healthcare Division of Johnson  Johnson Inc. received a Notice of Civil Claim filed by Nick Field in the Supreme Court of British Columbia, Canada (the BC Civil Claim). The BC Civil Claim is a putative class action brought on behalf of persons who reside in British Columbia and who purchased during the period between September 20, 2001 and in or about December 2010 one or more various McNeil infants' or children's over-the-counter medicines that were manufactured at the Fort Washington facility. The BC Civil Claim alleges that the defendants violated the BC Business Practices and Consumer Protection Act, and other Canadian statutes and common laws, by selling medicines that were allegedly not safe and/or effective or did not comply with Canadian Good Manufacturing Practices. The class certification hearing scheduled for October 2015 was adjourned, and there is currently no date set for that hearing. In August 2014, United States Customs and Border Protection (US CBP) issued a Penalty Notice against Janssen Ortho LLC (Janssen Ortho), assessing penalties for the alleged improper classification of darunavir ethanolate (PREZISTA  ) in connection with its importation into the United States. In October 2014, Janssen Ortho submitted a Petition for Relief in response to the Penalty Notice. In May 2015, US CBP issued an Amended Penalty Notice assessing substantial penalties and Janssen Ortho filed its Petition for Relief in July 2015. In March 2015, Costco Wholesale Corporation (Costco) filed a complaint against Johnson  Johnson Vision Care, Inc. (JJVCI) in the United States District Court of the Northern District of California, alleging antitrust claims of an unlawful vertical price fixing agreement between JJVCI, Costco and unnamed other distributors and retailers. Costco alleges that the alleged agreements harmed competition by causing increases in the price Costco customers pay for JJVCI contact lenses. Costco is seeking an injunction and monetary damages. In June 2015, the case was transferred to the United States District Court for the Middle District of Florida along with related class action cases described below. In November 2015, the Court denied a JJVCI motion to dismiss. In March and April 2015, over 30 putative class action complaints were filed by contact lens patients in a number of courts around the United States against Johnson  Johnson Vision Care, Inc. (JJVCI), other contact lens manufacturers, distributors, and retailers, alleging vertical and horizontal conspiracies to fix the retail prices of contact lenses. The complaints alleged that the manufacturers reached agreements between each other and certain distributors and retailers concerning the prices at which some contact lenses could be sold to consumers. The plaintiffs are seeking damages. All of the class action cases were transferred to the United States District Court for the Middle District of Florida in June 2015 along with the related case filed by Costco Wholesale Corporation described above. The plaintiffs filed a Consolidated Class Action complaint in November 2015, and in December 2015, JJVCI and other defendants filed motions to dismiss. In April 2015, Johnson  Johnson Vision Care, Inc. (JJVCI) filed a complaint in the United States District Court for the District of Utah against the State of Utah seeking a declaratory judgment that a law passed by the state to ban unilateral pricing policies solely in the contact lens market violates the Commerce Clause of the United States Constitution. The Court denied JJVCI's motion for a preliminary injunction. JJVCI appealed. Argument on the appeal was held in August 2015.  ##TABLE_START  ##TABLE_END In April 2015, Adimmune Corporation Ltd (Adimmune) commenced an arbitration in the International Court of Arbitration - International Chamber of Commerce against Crucell Switzerland AG (now Janssen Vaccines AG) and Crucell Holland BV (collectively, Crucell). Adimmune claims that Crucell breached certain agreements relating to the supply of flu antigen when Crucell ceased purchasing flu antigen from Adimmune. In December 2015, Adimmune filed its Statement of Claim seeking monetary damages. In August 2015, two third-party payors filed a purported class action in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Louisiana against Janssen Research  Development, LLC, Janssen Ortho LLC, Janssen Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Ortho-McNeil-Janssen Pharmaceuticals, and Johnson  Johnson (as well as certain Bayer entities), alleging that the defendants improperly marketed and promoted XARELTO  as safer and more effective than less expensive alternative medications while failing to fully disclose its risks. The complaint seeks damages in an unspecified amount. Johnson  Johnson or its subsidiaries are also parties to a number of proceedings brought under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act, commonly known as Superfund, and comparable state, local or foreign laws in which the primary relief sought is the cost of past and/or future remediation.  ##TABLE_START  ##TABLE_END 22. Restructuring The Company announced restructuring actions in its Medical Devices segment to better serve the needs of patients and customers in todays evolving healthcare marketplace. The Company is undertaking actions to strengthen its go-to-market model, accelerate the pace of innovation, further prioritize key platforms and geographies, and streamline operations while maintaining high quality standards. The Company estimates that, in connection with its plans, it will record pre-tax restructuring charges of approximately $2.0 billion to $2.4 billion , most of which are expected to be incurred by 2017. In the fiscal fourth quarter of 2015, the Company recorded a pre-tax charge of $590 million , of which $81 million is included in cost of products sold. The $590 million restructuring charge consists of severance costs of $484 million , asset write-offs of $86 million and $20 million in other costs, primarily related to supply contracts. Additionally, as part of the plan, the Company expects that the restructuring actions will result in position eliminations of approximately 4 to 6 percent of the Medical Devices segments global workforce over the next two years, subject to any consultation procedures in countries, where required. The Company estimates that approximately one half of the cumulative pre-tax costs will result in cash outlays, including approximately $500 million of employee severance. Approximately one half of the cumulative pre-tax costs are non-cash, relating primarily to facility rationalization, inventory write-offs and intangible asset write-offs. The following table summarizes the severance charges and the associated spending for the fiscal year ended 2015: ##TABLE_START (Dollars in Millions) Severance Asset Write-offs Other Total 2015 restructuring charge $ 86 590      Current year activity  3      Reserve balance, January 3, 2016* $  501      ##TABLE_END*Cash outlays for severance are expected to be substantially paid out over the next 24 months in accordance with the Company's plans and local laws.  ##TABLE_START  ##TABLE_END Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm To the Shareholders and Board of Directors of Johnson  Johnson In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and the related consolidated statements of earnings, statements of comprehensive income, statements of equity, and statements of cash flows present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Johnson  Johnson and its subsidiaries at January 3, 2016 and December 28, 2014, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended January 3, 2016 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of January 3, 2016, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). The Company's management is responsible for these financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying \"Management's Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting.\" Our responsibility is to express opinions on these financial statements and on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our integrated audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audits of the financial statements included examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions. As discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company changed the manner in which it classifies deferred tax assets and liabilities in 2015. A company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. /s/ PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP Florham Park, New Jersey February 24, 2016  ##TABLE_START  ##TABLE_END Managements Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting Under Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, management is required to assess the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting as of the end of each fiscal year and report, based on that assessment, whether the Companys internal control over financial reporting is effective. Management of the Company is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. The Companys internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance as to the reliability of the Companys financial reporting and the preparation of external financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Internal controls over financial reporting, no matter how well designed, have inherent limitations. Therefore, internal control over financial reporting determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and may not prevent or detect all misstatements. Moreover, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. The Companys management has assessed the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting as of January 3, 2016. In making this assessment, the Company used the criteria established by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013). These criteria are in the areas of control environment, risk assessment, control activities, information and communication, and monitoring. The Companys assessment included extensive documenting, evaluating and testing the design and operating effectiveness of its internal controls over financial reporting. Based on the Companys processes and assessment, as described above, management has concluded that, as of January 3, 2016, the Companys internal control over financial reporting was effective. The effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting as of January 3, 2016 has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report, which appears herein. ##TABLE_START /s/ Alex Gorsky  /s/ Dominic J.

The Companys primary focus is products related to human health and well-being. Johnson  Johnson was incorporated in the State of New Jersey in 1887. The Executive Committee of Johnson  Johnson is the principal management group responsible for the strategic operations and allocation of the resources of the Company. This Committee oversees and coordinates the activities of the Company's three business segments: Consumer, Pharmaceutical and Medical Devices. Within the strategic parameters provided by the Committee, senior management groups at U.S. and international operating companies are each responsible for their own strategic plans and the day-to-day operations of those companies. Each subsidiary within the business segments is, with limited exceptions, managed by residents of the country where located. Segments of Business The Company is organized into three business segments: Consumer, Pharmaceutical and Medical Devices. Additional information required by this item is incorporated herein by reference to the narrative and tabular descriptions of segments and operating results under: Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition of this Report; and Note 18 Segments of Business and Geographic Areas of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Report. Consumer The Consumer segment includes a broad range of products used in the baby care, oral care, beauty (previously referred to as skin care), over-the-counter pharmaceutical, womens health and wound care markets. Baby Care includes the JOHNSONS  line of products. Oral Care includes the LISTERINE  product line. Major brands in Beauty include the AVEENO  ; CLEAN  CLEAR  ; DABAO  ; JOHNSONS  Adult; LE PETITE MARSEILLAIS  ; NEUTROGENA  ; RoC  and OGX  product lines.

Wound Care brands include the BAND-AID  Brand Adhesive Bandages and NEOSPORIN  First Aid product lines. These products are marketed to the general public and sold both to retail outlets and distributors throughout the world. Pharmaceutical The Pharmaceutical segment is focused on five therapeutic areas: immunology (e.g., rheumatoid arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease and psoriasis), infectious diseases and vaccines (e.g., HIV, hepatitis, respiratory infections and tuberculosis), neuroscience (e.g., Alzheimer's disease, mood disorders and schizophrenia), oncology (e.g., prostate cancer, hematologic malignancies and lung cancer), and cardiovascular and metabolic diseases (e.g., thrombosis and diabetes). Products in this segment are distributed directly to retailers, wholesalers, hospitals and health care professionals for prescription use. Key products in the Pharmaceutical segment include: REMICADE  (infliximab), a treatment for a number of immune-mediated inflammatory diseases; SIMPONI  (golimumab), a subcutaneous treatment for adults with moderate to severe rheumatoid arthritis, active psoriatic arthritis, active ankylosing spondylitis and moderately active to severely active ulcerative colitis; SIMPONI ARIA  (golimumab), an intravenous treatment for adults with moderate to severe rheumatoid arthritis; STELARA  (ustekinumab), a treatment for adults with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis and active psoriatic arthritis, and for adults with moderately to severely active Crohn's disease; PREZISTA  (darunavir), EDURANT  (rilpivirine), and PREZCOBIX  /REZOLSTA  (darunavir/cobicistat), antiretroviral medicines for the treatment of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1) in combination with other antiretroviral products; CONCERTA  (methylphenidate HCl) extended-release tablets CII, a treatment for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder; INVEGA  (paliperidone) extended-release tablets, for the treatment of schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorder; INVEGA SUSTENNA  /XEPLION  (paliperidone palmitate), for the treatment of schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorder in adults; INVEGA TRINZA  /TREVICTA  (paliperidone palmitate), for the treatment of schizophrenia in patients after they have been adequately treated with INVEGA SUSTENNA  for at least four months; RISPERDAL CONSTA  (risperidone long-acting injection), for the treatment of schizophrenia and the maintenance treatment of Bipolar 1 Disorder in adults; VELCADE  (bortezomib), a treatment for multiple myeloma and for use in combination with rituximab, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin and prednisone for the treatment of adult patients with previously  ##TABLE_START  ##TABLE_END untreated mantle cell lymphoma; ZYTIGA  (abiraterone acetate), used in combination with prednisone as a treatment for metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer; IMBRUVICA  (ibrutinib), an oral, once-daily therapy approved for use in treating certain B-cell malignancies, or blood cancers, and Waldenstrm's Macroglobulinemia; DARZALEX  (daratumumab), for the treatment of relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma; PROCRIT  (epoetin alfa, sold outside the U.S. as EPREX  ), to stimulate red blood cell production; XARELTO  (rivaroxaban), an oral anticoagulant for the prevention of deep vein thrombosis (DVT), which may lead to pulmonary embolism (PE) in patients undergoing hip or knee replacement surgery, to reduce the risk of stroke and systemic embolism in patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation, for the treatment and reduction of risk of recurrence of DVT and PE; INVOKANA  (canagliflozin), for the treatment of adults with type 2 diabetes; INVOKAMET  /VOKANAMET  (canagliflozin/metformin HCl), a combination therapy of fixed doses of canagliflozin and metformin hydrochloride for the treatment of adults with type 2 diabetes; and INVOKAMET  XR (canagliflozin/metformin hydrochloride extended-release), a once-daily, fixed-dose combination therapy of canagliflozin and metformin hydrochloride extended-release, for the treatment of adults with type 2 diabetes. Many of these medicines were developed in collaboration with strategic partners or are licensed from other companies and maintain active lifecycle development programs. Medical Devices The Medical Devices segment includes a broad range of products used in the orthopaedic, surgery, cardiovascular, diabetes care and vision care fields. These products are distributed to wholesalers, hospitals and retailers, and used principally in the professional fields by physicians, nurses, hospitals, eye care professionals and clinics. They include orthopaedic products; general surgery, biosurgical, endomechanical and energy products; electrophysiology products to treat cardiovascular disease; sterilization and disinfection products to reduce surgical infection; diabetes care products, such as blood glucose monitoring and insulin delivery products; and disposable contact lenses. For details regarding acquisitions and divestitures see Note 20 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8. Geographic Areas The business of Johnson  Johnson is conducted by more than 230 operating companies located in 60 countries, including the U.S., in virtually all countries throughout the world. The products made and sold in the international business include many of those described above under  Segments of Business  Consumer,  Pharmaceutical and  Medical Devices. However, the principal markets, products and methods of distribution in the international business vary with the country and the culture. The products sold in international business include those developed in the U.S. and by subsidiaries abroad. Investments and activities in some countries outside the U.S. are subject to higher risks than comparable U.S. activities because the investment and commercial climate may be influenced by financial instability in international economies, restrictive economic policies and political and legal system uncertainties. Raw Materials Raw materials essential to the Company's business are generally readily available from multiple sources. Where there are exceptions, the temporary unavailability of those raw materials would not likely have a material adverse effect on the financial results of the Company. Patents The Company's subsidiaries have made a practice of obtaining patent protection on their products and processes where possible. They own, or are licensed under, a significant number of patents in the U.S. and other countries relating to their products, product uses, formulations and manufacturing processes, which in the aggregate are believed to be of material importance to the Company in the operation of its businesses. The Companys subsidiaries face patent challenges from third parties, including challenges seeking to manufacture and market generic and biosimilar versions of the Company's key pharmaceutical products prior to expiration of the applicable patents covering those products. Significant legal proceedings and claims involving the Company's patent and other intellectual property are described in Note 21, Legal ProceedingsIntellectual Property of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Report. Sales of the Companys largest product, REMICADE  (infliximab), accounted for approximately 9.7% of the Company's total revenues for fiscal 2016. Accordingly, the patents related to this product are believed to be material to the Company. There are two sets of patents related specifically to REMICADE  . The first set of patents is co-owned by Janssen Biotech, Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of Johnson  Johnson, and NYU Langone Medical Center (NYU). Janssen Biotech, Inc. has an exclusive license to NYU's interests in the patents. These patents have expired in all countries outside the United States.  In the United States, the one remaining patent, which expires in September 2018, stands rejected following  ##TABLE_START  ##TABLE_END reexamination proceedings instituted by a third party in the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO). The patent has also been held invalid by the Federal District Court in the District of Massachusetts. The decisions by the USPTO and the Federal District Court have been appealed to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. The appeals are pending. The second set of patents specifically related to REMICADE  was granted to The Kennedy Institute of Rheumatology in Europe, Canada, Australia and the United States. Janssen Biotech, Inc. has licenses (exclusive for human anti-TNF antibodies and semi-exclusive for non-human anti-TNF antibodies) to these patents, which expire in 2017 outside of the United States and 2018 in the United States. Certain of these patents have been successfully challenged and invalidated, and others are under review in various patent offices around the world and are also subject to litigation in Canada. The Company does not expect that any extensions will be available for the above described patents specifically related to REMICADE  . In 2016, a third party received approval from the Food and Drug Administration for sale of its infliximab biosimilar in the United States and introduced its biosimilar to the U.S. market in late 2016. For a more extensive description of legal matters regarding the patents related to REMICADE  , see Note 21 Legal Proceedings  Intellectual Property  Pharmaceutical  REMICADE  Related Cases of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Report. In addition to competing in the immunology market with REMICADE  , the Company is currently marketing STELARA  (ustekinumab), SIMPONI  (golimumab) and SIMPONI ARIA  (golimumab), next generation immunology products with remaining patent lives of up to seven years. Trademarks The Companys subsidiaries have made a practice of selling their products under trademarks and of obtaining protection for these trademarks by all available means. These trademarks are protected by registration in the U.S. and other countries where such products are marketed. The Company considers these trademarks in the aggregate to be of material importance in the operation of its businesses. Seasonality Worldwide sales do not reflect any significant degree of seasonality; however, spending has been heavier in the fourth quarter of each year than in other quarters. This reflects increased spending decisions, principally for advertising and research and development activity. Competition In all of their product lines, the Company's subsidiaries compete with companies both locally and globally. Competition exists in all product lines without regard to the number and size of the competing companies involved. Competition in research, both internally and externally sourced, involving the development and the improvement of new and existing products and processes, is particularly significant. The development of new and innovative products, as well as protecting the underlying intellectual property of the Companys product portfolio, is important to the Company's success in all areas of its business. The competitive environment requires substantial investments in continuing research. In addition, the development and maintenance of customer demand for the Companys consumer products involve significant expenditures for advertising and promotion. Research and Development Research activities represent a significant part of the Companys businesses. Research and development expenditures relate to the processes of discovering, testing and developing new products, improving existing products, as well as demonstrating product efficacy and regulatory compliance prior to launch. The Company remains committed to investing in research and development with the aim of delivering high quality and innovative products. Worldwide costs of research and development activities amounted to $9.1 billion, $9.0 billion and $8.5 billion for fiscal years 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Research facilities are located in the United States, Belgium, Brazil, Canada, China, France, Germany, India, Israel, Japan, the Netherlands, Singapore, Switzerland and the United Kingdom. Environment The Company is subject to a variety of U.S. and international environmental protection measures. The Company believes that its operations comply in all material respects with applicable environmental laws and regulations. The Companys compliance with these requirements did not change during the past year, and is not expected to have a material effect upon its capital expenditures, cash flows, earnings or competitive position.  ##TABLE_START  ##TABLE_END Regulation The Companys businesses are subject to varying degrees of governmental regulation in the countries in which operations are conducted, and the general trend is toward increasingly stringent regulation. In the U.S., the drug, device and cosmetic industries have long been subject to regulation by various federal and state agencies, primarily as to product safety, efficacy, manufacturing, advertising, labeling and safety reporting. The exercise of broad regulatory powers by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (the \"FDA\") continues to result in increases in the amounts of testing and documentation required for FDA approval of new drugs and devices and a corresponding increase in the expense of product introduction. Similar trends are also evident in major markets outside of the U.S. The costs of human health care have been and continue to be a subject of study, investigation and regulation by governmental agencies and legislative bodies around the world. In the U.S., attention has been focused on drug prices and profits and programs that encourage doctors to write prescriptions for particular drugs, or to recommend, use or purchase particular medical devices. Payers have become a more potent force in the market place and increased attention is being paid to drug and medical device pricing, appropriate drug and medical device utilization and the quality and costs of health care generally. U.S. government agencies continue to implement the extensive requirements of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (the \"ACA\"). These have both positive and negative impacts on the U.S. healthcare industry with much remaining uncertain as to how various provisions of the ACA, and potential modification or repeal of ACA provisions, will ultimately affect the industry. The regulatory agencies under whose purview the Company operates have administrative powers that may subject it to actions such as product withdrawals, recalls, seizure of products and other civil and criminal sanctions. In some cases, the Companys subsidiaries may deem it advisable to initiate product recalls. In addition, business practices in the health care industry have come under increased scrutiny, particularly in the United States, by government agencies and state attorneys general, and resulting investigations and prosecutions carry the risk of significant civil and criminal penalties. Further, the Company relies on global supply chains, and production and distribution processes, that are complex, are subject to increasing regulatory requirements that may affect sourcing, supply and pricing of materials used in the Company's products. These processes also are subject to lengthy regulatory approvals. Available Information The Companys main corporate website address is www.jnj.com.

RISK FACTORS ##TABLE_END The Company faces a number of uncertainties and risks that are difficult to predict and many of which are outside of the Company's control. In addition to the other information in this report and the Companys other filings with the SEC, investors should consider carefully the factors set forth below. Investors should be aware that it is not possible to predict or identify all such factors and that the following is not meant to be a complete discussion of all potential risks or uncertainties. If known or unknown risks or uncertainties materialize, the Companys business, results of operations or financial condition could be adversely affected, potentially in a material way.  ##TABLE_START  ##TABLE_END One of the Companys key products, REMICADE  (infliximab), is experiencing biosimilar competition, which will result in a reduction in U.S. sales of REMICADE  . The Company has experienced significant challenges to patents covering its largest product, REMICADE  (infliximab) (accounting for approximately 9.7% of the Companys total revenues for fiscal 2016), and continues to assert certain patents related to the product. In April 2016, the FDA approved for sale in the United States an infliximab biosimilar to be marketed by a subsidiary of Pfizer Inc. In October 2016, the notice of launch period under the U.S. Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act (the BPCIA) passed and in November 2016 Pfizer began shipment of an infliximab biosimilar to wholesalers in the United States. Sales of an infliximab biosimilar in the U.S. market will result in a reduction in U.S. sales of REMICADE  . Global sales in the Companys pharmaceutical and medical devices segments may be negatively impacted by healthcare reforms and increasing pricing pressures. Sales of the Companys pharmaceutical and medical device products are significantly affected by reimbursements by third-party payers such as government healthcare programs, private insurance plans and managed care organizations. As part of various efforts to contain healthcare costs, these payers are putting downward pressure on prices at which products will be reimbursed. In the United States, increased purchasing power of entities that negotiate on behalf of Medicare, Medicaid, and private sector beneficiaries, in part due to continued consolidation among health care providers, could result in further pricing pressures. Outside the United States, numerous major markets, including the EU and Japan, have pervasive government involvement in funding healthcare and, in that regard, directly or indirectly impose price controls, limit access to, or reimbursement for, the Companys products, or reduce the value of its intellectual property protection. The Company is subject to significant legal proceedings that can result in significant expenses, fines and reputational damage. In the ordinary course of business, Johnson  Johnson and its subsidiaries are subject to numerous claims and lawsuits involving various issues such as patent disputes, product liability and claims that their product sales, marketing and pricing practices violate various antitrust, unfair trade practices and/or consumer protection laws. The most significant of these proceedings are described in Note 21, Legal Proceedings under Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Report. While the Company believes it has substantial defenses in these matters, it is not feasible to predict the ultimate outcome of litigation. The Company could in the future be required to pay significant amounts as a result of settlements or judgments in these matters, potentially in excess of accruals. The resolution of, or increase in accruals for, one or more of these matters in any reporting period could have a material adverse effect on the Company's results of operations and cash flows for that period. Furthermore, as a result of cost and availability factors, effective November 1, 2005, the Company ceased purchasing third-party product liability insurance. Product reliability, safety and effectiveness concerns can have significant negative impacts on sales and results of operations, lead to litigation and cause reputational damage. Concerns about product safety, whether raised internally or by regulators or consumer advocates, and whether or not based on scientific evidence, can result in safety alerts, product recalls, governmental investigations, regulatory action on the part of the FDA (or its counterpart in other countries), private claims and lawsuits, payment of fines and settlements, declining sales and reputational damage. These circumstances can also result in damage to brand image, brand equity and consumer trust in the Companys products. Product recalls have in the past, and could in the future, prompt government investigations and inspections, the shutdown of manufacturing facilities, continued product shortages and related sales declines, significant remediation costs, reputational damage, possible civil penalties and criminal prosecution. Changes in tax laws or exposures to additional tax liabilities could negatively impact the Companys operating results. Changes in tax laws or regulations, including tax reform proposals in the U.S., Belgium and Switzerland, could negatively impact the Companys effective tax rate and results of operations. A change in statutory tax rate may result in the revaluation of the Companys deferred tax assets and liabilities related to the relevant jurisdiction in the period in which the new tax law is enacted, potentially resulting in a material expense or benefit recorded to the Companys Consolidated Statement of Earnings for that period. For a discussion of risks of changes in tax rates in other countries, including Belgium, please see Managements Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial ConditionOther InformationEconomic and Market Factors in Item 7 of this Report. The Company conducts business and files tax returns in numerous countries and currently has tax audits in progress with many tax authorities. In connection with the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (BEPS) project, starting in 2017, companies are required to disclose more information to tax authorities on operations around the world, which may lead to greater audit scrutiny of profits earned in other countries. The Company regularly assesses the likely outcomes of its tax audits to determine the appropriateness of its tax reserves. However, any tax authority  ##TABLE_START  ##TABLE_END could take a position on tax treatment that is contrary to the Companys expectations, which could result in tax liabilities in excess of reserves. The Company may not be able to successfully secure and defend intellectual property rights essential to the Companys businesses. The Company owns or licenses a significant number of patents and other proprietary rights, determined by patent offices, courts and lawmakers in various countries, relating to its products and manufacturing processes. These rights are essential to the Companys businesses and materially important to the Companys results of operations. Public policy, both within and outside the U.S., has become increasingly unfavorable toward intellectual property rights. The Company cannot be certain that it will obtain adequate patent protection for new products and technologies in the U.S. and other important markets or that such protections, once granted, will last as long as originally anticipated. Competitors routinely challenge the validity or extent of the Companys owned or licensed patents and proprietary rights through litigation, interferences, oppositions and other proceedings. These proceedings absorb resources and can be protracted as well as unpredictable. In addition, challenges that the Companys products infringe the patents of third parties could result in the need to pay past damages and future royalties and adversely affect the competitive position and sales of the products in question. The Company has faced increasing patent challenges from third parties seeking to manufacture and market generic and biosimilar versions of the Company's key pharmaceutical products prior to expiration of the applicable patents covering those products. In the United States, manufacturers of generic versions of innovative human pharmaceutical products may challenge the validity, or claim non-infringement, of innovator products through the Abbreviated New Drug Application, or ANDA, process with the FDA. The BPCIA, enacted in 2010, which created a new regulatory pathway for the approval by the FDA of biosimilar alternatives to innovator-developed biological products, also created mechanisms for biosimilar applicants to challenge the patents on the innovator biologics. The inter partes review (IPR) process with the USPTO, created under the 2011 America Invents Act, is also being used by competitors to challenge patents held by the Companys subsidiaries. For example, a key patent for ZYTIGA  is currently subject to patent litigation and several IPR proceedings brought by generic companies seeking to invalidate the patent. In the event the Company is not successful in defending its patents against such challenges, or upon the at-risk launch (despite pending patent infringement litigation) by the generic or biosimilar firm of its product, the Company can lose a major portion of revenues for the referenced product in a very short period of time. Current legal proceedings involving the Companys patents and other intellectual property rights are described in Note 21, Legal ProceedingsIntellectual Property of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Report. The Companys businesses operate in highly competitive product markets and competitive pressures could adversely affect the Companys earnings. The Company faces substantial competition in all three operating segments and in all geographic markets. The Companys businesses compete with companies of all sizes on the basis of cost-effectiveness, technological innovations, intellectual property rights, product performance, real or perceived product advantages, pricing and availability and rate of reimbursement. The Company also competes with other market participants in securing rights to acquisitions, collaborations and licensing agreements with third parties. Competition for rights to product candidates and technologies may result in significant investment and acquisition costs and onerous agreement terms for the Company. Competitors development of more effective or less costly products, and/or their ability to secure patent and other intellectual property rights and successfully market products ahead of us, could negatively impact sales of the Companys existing products as well as its ability to bring new products to market despite significant prior investment in the related product development. For the Companys pharmaceutical businesses, loss of patent exclusivity for a product often is followed by a substantial reduction in sales as competitors gain regulatory approval for generic and other competing products and enter the market. Similar competition can be triggered by the loss of exclusivity for a biological product. For the Companys medical device businesses, technological innovation, product quality, reputation and customer service are especially important to competitiveness. Development by other companies of new or improved products, processes and technologies could threaten to make the Companys products or technologies less desirable, less economical or obsolete. The Companys consumer businesses face intense competition from other branded products and retailers private-label brands. If the Company fails to sufficiently differentiate and market its brand name consumer products, this could adversely affect revenues and profitability of those products.  ##TABLE_START  ##TABLE_END Significant challenges or delays in the Companys innovation and development of new products, technologies and indications could have an adverse impact on the Companys long-term success. The Companys continued growth and success depends on its ability to innovate and develop new and differentiated products and services that address the evolving health care needs of patients, providers and consumers. Development of successful products and technologies is also necessary to offset revenue losses when the Companys existing products lose market share due to various factors such as competition and loss of patent exclusivity. New products introduced within the past five years accounted for approximately 22% of 2016 sales. The Company cannot be certain when or whether it will be able to develop, license or otherwise acquire companies, products and technologies, whether particular product candidates will be granted regulatory approval, and, if approved, whether the products will be commercially successful. The Company pursues product development through internal research and development as well as through collaborations, acquisitions, joint ventures and licensing or other arrangements with third parties. In all of these contexts, developing new products, particularly pharmaceutical and biotechnology products and medical devices, requires significant investment of resources over many years. Only a very few biopharmaceutical research and development programs result in commercially viable products. The process depends on many factors including the ability to discern patients and health care providers future needs; develop promising new compounds, strategies and technologies; achieve successful clinical trial results; secure effective intellectual property protection; obtain regulatory approvals on a timely basis; and, if and when they reach the market, successfully differentiate the Companys products from competing products and approaches to treatment. New products or enhancements to existing products may not be accepted quickly or significantly in the marketplace due to product and price competition, changes in customer preferences or healthcare purchasing patterns, resistance by healthcare providers or uncertainty over third-party reimbursement. Even following initial regulatory approval, the success of a product can be adversely impacted by safety and efficacy findings in larger real world patient populations, as well as market entry of competitive products. The Company faces increasing regulatory scrutiny which imposes significant compliance costs and exposes the Company to government investigations, legal actions and penalties. Like other companies in the healthcare industry, the Company is subject to extensive regulation, investigations and legal action, by national, state and local government agencies in the United States and other countries in which they operate. Regulatory issues regarding compliance with Good Manufacturing Practices (cGMP) (and comparable quality regulations in foreign countries) by manufacturers of drugs, devices and consumer products can lead to fines and penalties, product recalls, product shortages, interruptions in production, delays in new product approvals and litigation. In addition, the marketing, pricing and sale of the Companys products are subject to regulation, investigations and legal actions including under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, the Medicaid Rebate Program, federal and state false claims acts, state unfair trade practices acts and consumer protection laws. Increased scrutiny of health care industry business practices in recent years by government agencies and state attorneys general in the U.S., and any resulting investigations and prosecutions, carry risk of significant civil and criminal penalties including, but not limited to, debarment from participation in government healthcare programs. Any such debarment could have a material adverse effect on the Companys business and results of operations. The most significant current investigations and litigation brought by government agencies are described in Note 21, Legal Proceedings-Government Proceedings under Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Report. The Company faces a variety of risks associated with conducting business internationally. The Companys extensive operations and business activity outside the U.S. are accompanied by certain financial, economic and political risks, including those listed below. Foreign Currency Exchange : In fiscal 2016, approximately 47% of the Companys sales occurred outside of the U.S., with approximately 22% in Europe, 8% in the Western Hemisphere, excluding the U.S., and 17% in the Asia-Pacific and Africa region. Changes in non-U.S. currencies relative to the U.S. dollar impact the Companys revenues and expenses. While the Company uses financial instruments to mitigate the impact of fluctuations in currency exchange rates on its cash flows, unhedged exposures continue to be subject to currency fluctuations. In addition, the weakening or strengthening of the U.S. dollar may result in significant favorable or unfavorable translation effects when the operating results of the Companys non-U.S. business activity are translated into U.S. dollars. Inflation and Currency Devaluation Risks : The Company faces challenges in maintaining profitability of operations in economies experiencing high inflation rates. The Company has accounted for operations in Venezuela as highly inflationary, as the prior three-year cumulative inflation rate surpassed 100%. While the Company strives to maintain profit margins in these areas through cost reduction programs, productivity improvements and periodic price increases, it might experience operating losses as a result of continued inflation. In addition, the impact of currency devaluations in countries experiencing high inflation rates or significant currency exchange fluctuations could negatively impact the Companys operating results.  ##TABLE_START  ##TABLE_END Illegal Importation of Pharmaceutical Products : The illegal importation of pharmaceutical products from countries where government price controls or other market dynamics result in lower prices may adversely affect the Companys sales and profitability in the U.S. and other countries in which the Company operates. With the exception of limited quantities of prescription drugs for personal use, foreign imports of pharmaceutical products are illegal under current U.S. law. However, the volume of illegal imports continues to rise as the ability of patients and other customers to obtain the lower-priced imports has grown significantly. Anti-Bribery and Other Regulations: The Company is subject to various federal and foreign laws that govern its international business practices with respect to payments to government officials. Those laws include the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA), which prohibits U.S. publicly traded companies, from promising, offering, or giving anything of value to foreign officials with the corrupt intent of influencing the foreign official for the purpose of helping the Company obtain or retain business or gain any improper advantage. The Companys business is heavily regulated and therefore involves significant interaction with foreign officials. Also, in many countries outside the U.S., the health care providers who prescribe human pharmaceuticals are employed by the government and the purchasers of human pharmaceuticals are government entities; therefore, the Companys interactions with these prescribers and purchasers are subject to regulation under the FCPA. In addition to the U.S. application and enforcement of the FCPA, various jurisdictions in which the Company operates have laws and regulations, including the U.K Bribery Act 2010, aimed at preventing and penalizing corrupt and anticompetitive behavior. Enforcement activities under these laws could subject the Company to additional administrative and legal proceedings and actions, which could include claims for civil penalties, criminal sanctions, and administrative remedies, including exclusion from health care programs. Other Legal, Social and Political Risks . Other risks inherent in conducting business globally include: ##TABLE_START  protective economic policies taken by governments such as trade protection measures and import/export licensing requirements; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  compliance with local regulations and laws including, in some countries, regulatory requirements restricting the Companys ability to manufacture or sell its products in the relevant market; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  diminished protection of intellectual property and contractual rights in certain jurisdictions; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  potential nationalization or expropriation of the Companys foreign assets; and ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  disruptions to markets due to war, armed conflict, terrorism, social upheavals or pandemics. ##TABLE_END Interruptions and delays in manufacturing operations could adversely affect the Companys business, sales and reputation. The Companys manufacture of products requires the timely delivery of sufficient amounts of complex, high-quality components and materials. These subsidiaries operate 119 manufacturing facilities as well as sourcing from hundreds of suppliers around the world. The Company has in the past, and may in the future, face unanticipated interruptions and delays in manufacturing through its internal or external supply chain. Manufacturing disruptions can occur for many reasons including regulatory action, production quality deviations or safety issues, labor disputes, site-specific incidents (such as fires), natural disasters, raw material shortages, political unrest and terrorist attacks. Such delays and difficulties in manufacturing can result in product shortages, declines in sales and reputational impact as well as significant remediation and related costs associated with addressing the shortage. An information security incident, including a cybersecurity breach, could have a negative impact to the Companys business or reputation To meet business objectives, the Company relies on both internal information technology (IT) systems and networks, and those of third parties and their vendors, to process and store sensitive data, including confidential research, business plans, financial information, intellectual property, and personal data. The extensive information security and cybersecurity threats, which affect companies globally, pose a risk to the security and availability of these IT systems and networks, and the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the Companys sensitive data. The Company continually assesses these threats and makes investments to increase internal protection, detection, and response capabilities, as well as ensure the Companys third party providers have required capabilities and controls, to address this risk. To date, the Company has not experienced any material impact to our business or operations resulting from information or cybersecurity attacks; however, because of the frequently changing attack techniques, along with the increased volume and sophistication of the attacks, there is the potential for the Company to be adversely impacted. This impact could result in reputational, competitive, operational or other business harm as well as financial costs and regulatory action.  ##TABLE_START  ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START ", "1B": " Item 1B.

The Company also engages contract manufacturers. The Company is committed to maintaining all of its properties in good operating condition and repair, and the facilities are well utilized. McNEIL-PPC, Inc. (now Johnson  Johnson Consumer Inc.) (McNEIL-PPC) continues to operate under a consent decree, signed in 2011 with the FDA, which governs certain McNeil Consumer Healthcare manufacturing operations, and requires McNEIL-PPC to remediate the facilities it operates in Lancaster, Pennsylvania, Fort Washington, Pennsylvania, and Las Piedras, Puerto Rico (the \"Consent Decree\"). The Fort Washington facility was voluntarily shut down in April 2010, and subsequently many products were transferred to other manufacturing sites and successfully reintroduced to the market. After McNEIL-PPC successfully completed all requirements contained in the Consent Decree Workplans for the Lancaster and Las Piedras manufacturing sites and completed the steps required for third-party certification of the Fort Washington plant, a third-party cGMP expert submitted written certifications to the FDA for all three manufacturing sites. Following FDA inspections in 2015, McNEIL-PPC received notifications from the FDA that all three manufacturing facilities are in conformity with applicable laws and regulations. Commercial production in Fort Washington started as of September 2015. Under the Consent Decree, after receiving notice from the FDA of being in compliance with applicable laws and regulations, each of the three facilities is subject to a five-year audit period by a third-party cGMP expert. Thus, a third-party expert will continue to reassess the sites at various times for at least five years.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION ##TABLE_ENDOrganization and Business Segments Description of the Company and Business Segments Johnson  Johnson and its subsidiaries (the Company) have approximately 126,400 employees worldwide engaged in the research and development, manufacture and sale of a broad range of products in the health care field. The Company conducts business in virtually all countries of the world with the primary focus on products related to human health and well-being. The Company is organized into three business segments: Consumer, Pharmaceutical and Medical Devices. The Consumer segment includes a broad range of products used in the baby care, oral care, beauty (previously referred to as skin care), over-the-counter pharmaceutical, womens health and wound care markets. These products are marketed to the general public and sold both to retail outlets and distributors throughout the world. The Pharmaceutical segment is focused on five therapeutic areas, including immunology, infectious diseases, neuroscience, oncology, and cardiovascular and metabolic diseases. Products in this segment are distributed directly to retailers, wholesalers, hospitals and health care professionals for prescription use. The Medical Devices segment includes a broad range of products used in the orthopaedic, surgery, cardiovascular, diabetes care and vision care fields which are distributed to wholesalers, hospitals and retailers, and used principally in the professional fields by physicians, nurses, hospitals, eye care professionals and clinics. The Executive Committee of Johnson  Johnson is the principal management group responsible for the strategic operations and allocation of the resources of the Company. This Committee oversees and coordinates the activities of the Consumer, Pharmaceutical and Medical Devices business segments. In all of its product lines, the Company competes with companies both locally and globally, throughout the world. Competition exists in all product lines without regard to the number and size of the competing companies involved. Competition in research, involving the development and the improvement of new and existing products and processes, is particularly significant. The development of new and innovative products, as well as protecting the underlying intellectual property of the Company's product portfolio, is important to the Companys success in all areas of its business. The competitive environment requires substantial investments in continuing research. In addition, the development and maintenance of customer demand for the Companys consumer products involves significant expenditures for advertising and promotion. Managements Objectives The Company manages within a strategic framework with Our Credo as the foundation. The Company believes that our strategic operating principles: being broadly based in human health care, managing the business for the long term, having a decentralized management approach, and being committed to our people and values, are crucial to successfully meeting the demands of the rapidly evolving markets in which we compete. To this end, management is focused on our long-term strategic growth drivers: creating value through innovation, expanding our global reach with a local focus, excellence in execution and leading with purpose. The Company is broadly based in human health care, and is committed to creating value by developing accessible, high quality, innovative products and services. New products introduced within the past five years accounted for approximately 22% of 2016 sales. In 2016, $9.1 billion, or 12.7% of sales, was invested in research and development, reflecting managements commitment to delivering new and differentiated products and services to meet evolving health care needs and sustain the Companys long-term growth. Our diverse businesses with more than 230 operating companies located in 60 countries are the key drivers of the Companys success. Maintaining the Companys decentralized management approach, while at the same time leveraging the extensive resources of the enterprise, positions the Company well to innovate, execute strategic plans and reach markets globally, as well as address the needs and challenges of the local markets. In order to remain a leader in health care, the Company strives to maintain a purpose-driven organization and is committed to developing global business leaders who can achieve these growth objectives. Businesses are managed for the long-term in order to sustain market leadership positions and enable growth, which provides an enduring source of value to our shareholders. Our Credo unifies all Johnson  Johnson employees in achieving these objectives, and provides a common set of values that serve as the foundation of the Companys responsibilities to patients, consumers and health care professionals, employees, communities and shareholders. The Company believes that these foundational values, its strategic framework and long-term growth drivers, along with its overall mission of improving the quality of life for people around the world, will enable Johnson  Johnson to continue to be a leader in the health care industry.  ##TABLE_START  ##TABLE_END Results of Operations Analysis of Consolidated Sales In 2016, worldwide sales increased 2.6% to $71.9 billion, compared to a decrease of 5.7% in 2015 and an increase of 4.2% in 2014.

In 2014, sales of the Company's Hepatitis C products, OLYSIO  /SOVRIAD  (simeprevir) and INCIVO  (telaprevir), had a positive impact of 2.8%, and the divestiture of the Ortho-Clinical Diagnostics business had a negative impact of 1.4% on the worldwide operational growth. Sales by U.S. companies were $37.8 billion in 2016, $35.7 billion in 2015 and $34.8 billion in 2014. This represents increases of 6.0% in 2016, 2.6% in 2015 and 9.0% in 2014. Sales by international companies were $34.1 billion in 2016, $34.4 billion in 2015 and $39.5 billion in 2014. This represents decreases of 0.9% in 2016, and 13.1% in 2015 and an increase of 0.4% in 2014. The five-year compound annual growth rates for worldwide, U.S. and international sales were 2.0%, 5.5% and (1.2)%, respectively. The ten-year compound annual growth rates for worldwide, U.S. and international sales were 3.0%, 2.4% and 3.8%, respectively. Sales by companies in Europe experienced a decline of 1.4% as compared to the prior year, including operational growth of 1.4%, offset by a negative currency impact of 2.8%. Sales by companies in the Western Hemisphere (excluding the U.S.) experienced a decline of 5.1% as compared to the prior year, including operational growth of 4.0% offset by a negative currency impact of 9.1%. Sales by companies in the Asia-Pacific, Africa region achieved growth of 1.8% as compared to the prior year, including operational growth of 1.4% and a positive currency impact of 0.4%. The 2016 sales growth percentage as compared to the prior year was negatively impacted by approximately 1.3% from additional shipping days in 2015. (See Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for Annual Closing Date details). While the additional week in 2015 added a few days to sales, it also added a full week's worth of operating costs; therefore, the net earnings impact was negligible. In 2016, the Company had two wholesalers distributing products for all three segments that represented approximately 13.5% and 10.7% of the total consolidated revenues. In 2015 and 2014, the Company had one wholesaler distributing products for all three segments that represented approximately 12.5% and 11.0%, respectively, of the total consolidated revenues.  ##TABLE_START  ##TABLE_END Analysis of Sales by Business Segments Consumer Segment Consumer segment sales in 2016 were $13.3 billion, a decrease of 1.5% from 2015, which included 1.5% operational growth offset by a negative currency impact of 3.0%. U.S. Consumer segment sales were $5.4 billion, an increase of 3.8%. International sales were $7.9 billion, a decrease of 4.8%, which included 0.1% operational growth offset by a negative currency impact of 4.9%. In 2016, the impact of acquisitions and divestitures on the Consumer segment operational sales growth was negative 0.5%. In 2016, the Consumer segment operational sales growth was negatively impacted 1.2% by operations in Venezuela and negatively impacted by 1.1% due to additional shipping days in 2015.

Operational growth was primarily driven by analgesics, anti-smoking aids and digestive health products. The Beauty franchise sales of $3.9 billion increased 7.3% as compared to the prior year, which included 9.4% operational growth and a negative currency impact of 2.1%. Operational growth was primarily due to sales from the recent acquisitions of Vogue International LLC, which contributed approximately 4.6%, and NeoStrata Company, Inc., as well as sales growth of NEUTROGENA  , AVEENO  adult products and DABAO  products. The Baby Care franchise sales were $2.0 billion in 2016, a decrease of 7.2% compared to the prior year, primarily due to competitive pressure partially offset by sales growth of AVEENO  baby products. The Oral Care franchise sales were $1.6 billion in 2016, a decrease of 0.8% as compared to the prior year, which included 2.0% operational growth and a negative currency impact of 2.8%. Operational growth was driven by increased sales of LISTERINE  products, attributable to new product launches and successful marketing campaigns. The Womens Health franchise sales were $1.1 billion in 2016, a decrease of 11.1% as compared to the prior year, primarily due to operations in Venezuela and the U.S. divestiture of TUCKS  . The Wound Care/Other franchise sales were $0.8 billion in 2016, a decrease of 23.5% from 2015, primarily due to the SPLENDA  divestiture. Consumer segment sales in 2015 were $13.5 billion, a decrease of 6.8% from 2014, which included 2.7% operational growth offset by a negative currency impact of 9.5%. U.S. Consumer segment sales were $5.2 billion, an increase of 2.5%.

In 2016, acquisitions, divestitures and competitive products to the Company's Hepatitis C products, OLYSIO  /SOVRIAD  (simeprevir) and INCIVO  (telaprevir), had a negative impact of 2.5% on the operational growth of the Pharmaceutical segment. In 2016, the Pharmaceutical segment operational growth was negatively impacted by 1.5% due to additional shipping days in 2015. The Pharmaceutical segment operational growth for 2016, as compared to the prior year, was not impacted by adjustments to previous reserve estimates as both periods included approximately $0.5 billion of adjustments.

Immunology products growth of 15.1% included operational growth of 15.9% and a negative currency impact of 0.8%. The strong growth of REMICADE  (infliximab), STELARA  (ustekinumab) and SIMPONI  /SIMPONI ARIA  (golimumab)was primarily driven by immunology market growth and increased penetration for both STELARA  (ustekinumab) and SIMPONI  /SIMPONI ARIA  (golimumab).  ##TABLE_START  ##TABLE_END The patents for REMICADE  (infliximab) in certain countries in Europe expired in February 2015. Biosimilar versions of REMICADE  have been introduced in certain markets outside the United States, resulting in a reduction in sales of REMICADE  in those markets. Additional biosimilar competition will likely result in a further reduction in REMICADE  sales in markets outside the United States. The introduction of a biosimilar version of REMICADE  in the United States is subject to enforcement of patent rights, approval by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and compliance with the 180-day notice provisions of the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act (the BPCIA). In April 2016, the FDA approved for sale in the United States an infliximab biosimilar to be marketed by a subsidiary of Pfizer Inc. In October 2016, the period for notice of launch under the BPCIA passed and Pfizer Inc., began shipment of an infliximab biosimilar to wholesalers in the United States in late November 2016. Sales of an infliximab biosimilar in the U.S. market will result in a reduction in U.S. sales of REMICADE  . The Company continues to assert REMICADE  related patent rights. See Note 21 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a description of legal matters regarding the REMICADE  patents. Infectious disease products sales were $3.2 billion, a decline of 12.3% from 2015, which included an operational decrease of 11.2% and a negative currency impact of 1.1%. Competitive products to the Company's Hepatitis C products, OLYSIO  /SOVRIAD  (simeprevir) and INCIVO  (telaprevir), had a significant negative impact on sales. The decline of Hepatitis C sales was partially offset by sales growth of EDURANT  (rilpivirine) and PREZCOBIX  (darunavir/cobicistat). Neuroscience products sales were $6.1 billion, a decrease of 2.8% from 2015, which included an operational decrease of 2.3% and a negative currency impact of 0.5%. Strong sales of INVEGA SUSTENNA  /XEPLION  / TRINZA  (paliperidone palmitate) were offset by lower sales of INVEGA  (paliperidone) due to generic competition, RISPERDAL CONSTA  (risperidone) and the impact of divestitures. Sales growth of CONCERTA  /methylphenidate was primarily due to a therapeutic equivalence reclassification of generic competitors. Oncology products achieved sales of $5.8 billion in 2016, representing an increase of 23.7% as compared to the prior year. Oncology products growth of 23.7% included operational growth of 25.2% and a negative currency impact of 1.5%. Contributors to the growth of Oncology products were strong sales of IMBRUVICA  (ibrutinib) and DARZALEX  (daratumumab) due to patient uptake, additional country launches and additional indications for IMBRUVICA  . Generic competition negatively impacted the sales growth of VELCADE  (bortezomib). Sales growth of ZYTIGA  (abiraterone acetate) in the Asia Pacific region, primarily due to the launch in China earlier this year, was partially offset by lower sales in Europe due to competition. Cardiovascular/Metabolism/Other products sales were $6.4 billion, a decline of 0.3% from 2015, which included an operational increase of 0.8% and a negative currency impact of 1.1%. Contributors to the growth were strong sales of XARELTO  (rivaroxaban) due to market share growth and INVOKANA  /INVOKAMET  (canagliflozin) due to market growth and continued uptake in the European Union and Canada. Sales of hormonal contraceptives were negatively impacted by generic competition and a higher adjustment to previous reserve estimates in 2015 as compared to 2016, which negatively impacted Cardiovascular/Metabolism/Other by approximately 2.3%.  ##TABLE_START  ##TABLE_END During 2016, the Company advanced its pipeline with several regulatory submissions and approvals for new drugs and additional indications for existing drugs as follows: ##TABLE_START Product Name (Chemical Name) Indication US Approv EU Approv US Filing EU Filing DARZALEX  (daratumumab) In combination with lenalidomide and dexamethasone, or bortezomib and dexamethasone, for the treatment of patients with multiple myeloma who have received at least one prior therapy      For the treatment of double refractory multiple myeloma     darunavir STR Single tablet regimen for HIV in treatment naive patients and treatment experienced patients     guselkumab Treatment of adults living with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis     IMBRUVICA  (ibrutinib) Additional indication for first-line treatment of chronic lymphocytic leukemia      Expanded label to include overall survival and combination data in chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma (CLL/SLL)      Expanded label to include treatment for patients with relapsed or refractory chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) or small lymphocytic lymphoma in combination with bendamustine and rituximab     INVOKAMET  (canagliflozin) Initial Therapy FDC with Metformin, Immediate Release     INVOKAMET  XR (canagliflozin) A once-daily therapy combining fixed doses of canagliflozin and metformin hydrochloride extended release for the treatment of adults with type 2 diabetes     SIMPONI  (golimumab) Treatment of polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis     SIMPONI ARIA  (golimumab) Treatment of adults living with active psoriatic arthritis and the treatment of adults living with active ankylosing spondylitis     sirukumab Treatment of Rheumatoid Arthritis     STELARA  (ustekinumab) Treatment of adults with moderately to severely active Crohn's disease      Treatment of adolescents (12 to 17 years of age) with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis     TREVICTA  (paliperidone palmitate a 3 monthly injection) Maintenance treatment of schizophrenia in adult patients     ##TABLE_ENDPharmaceutical segment sales in 2015 were $31.4 billion, a decrease of 2.7% from 2014, which included operational growth of 4.2% offset by a negative currency impact of 6.9%.

Sales growth was primarily driven by market growth, U.S. sales of the trauma TFNA nailing system, worldwide sales of the hip primary stem platform and the ATTUNE  Knee System. Growth was negatively impacted by continued pricing pressures. The Surgery franchise sales were $9.3 billion in 2016, an increase of 0.9% from 2015, which included operational growth of 2.3% and a negative currency impact of 1.4%. Operational growth in Advanced Surgery was driven by endocutter, energy and biosurgery products, primarily attributable to market growth, increased penetration in certain markets and new product launches. The acquisition of NeuWave Medical, Inc. also contributed to growth. The operational decline in General Surgery was due to lower sales of women's health and urology products and pricing pressures partially offset by growth of sutures. The operational decline in Specialty Surgery was primarily due to lower sales of Acclarent products and Advanced Sterilization Products outside the U.S., divestitures and competitive pressures in Sterilmed partially offset by growth of Mentor products outside the U.S. The Vision Care franchise achieved sales of $2.8 billion in 2016, an increase of 6.8% from 2015, which included operational growth of 6.4% and a positive currency impact of 0.4%. Growth in all the major regions was primarily driven by new product launches. The Cardiovascular franchise sales were $1.8 billion, a decrease of 9.2% from 2015, which represented an operational decline of 9.2%. Strong operational growth in the electrophysiology business driven by market growth, share growth and new product launches was more than offset by the impact of divesting the Cordis business. The Company completed the divestiture of the Cordis business to Cardinal Health on October 4, 2015. For additional details see Note 20 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The Diabetes Care franchise sales were $1.8 billion, a decrease of 7.2% from 2015, which represented an operational decline of 5.9% and a negative currency impact of 1.3%. The operational decline was primarily due to price declines and competitive pressures. On January 26, 2017, subsequent to year-end, the Company announced it is engaging in a process to evaluate potential strategic options for the Diabetes Care franchise. The Medical Devices segment sales in 2015 were $25.1 billion, a decrease of 8.7% from 2014, which included an operational decline of 1.4% and a negative currency impact of 7.3%. U.S. sales were $12.1 billion, a decrease of 1.0% as  ##TABLE_START  ##TABLE_END compared to the prior year. International sales were $13.0 billion, a decrease of 14.8% as compared to the prior year, with an operational decrease of 1.7% and a negative currency impact of 13.1%. The divestitures of the Ortho-Clinical Diagnostics and the Cordis Businesses had a negative impact of 3.2% and 0.6%, respectively, on the worldwide operational growth of the Medical Devices segment as compared to 2014. Analysis of Consolidated Earnings Before Provision for Taxes on Income Consolidated earnings before provision for taxes on income increased to $19.8 billion in 2016, as compared to $19.2 billion in 2015, an increase of 3.2%. The increase was primarily attributable to higher sales volume, favorable mix in the business and lower selling, marketing and administrative costs. This was partially offset by higher net litigation expense of $0.7 billion and a higher restructuring charge of $0.1 billion as compared to 2015. Additionally, the fiscal year 2015 included higher gains on the sale of assets/businesses as compared to 2016. The fiscal year of 2016 included gains of $0.6 billion from the divestitures of the controlled substance raw material and API business, certain anesthetic products in Europe and certain non-strategic Consumer brands versus gains of $2.6 billion recorded in 2015 primarily from the divestiture of the Cordis business, the U.S. divestiture of NUCYNTA  and the SPLENDA  brand. This was partially offset by a $0.3 billion intangible asset write-down related to Acclarent included in 2015. Consolidated earnings before provision for taxes on income decreased to $19.2 billion in 2015, as compared to $20.6 billion in 2014, a decrease of 6.6%. The decrease was primarily attributable to significantly lower sales of OLYSIO  /SOVRIAD  (simeprevir), negative currency impacts, a restructuring charge of $0.6 billion and higher intangible asset write-downs of $0.1 billion in 2015 as compared to 2014. The decrease was partially offset by lower net litigation expense of $1.1 billion, lower Synthes integration costs of $0.6 billion, a positive adjustment of $0.4 billion to previous reserve estimates including Managed Medicaid rebates, and higher gains of $0.3 billion from divestitures as compared to the prior year. The fiscal year 2015 included higher gains of $0.3 billion primarily from the divestitures of the Cordis business, the SPLENDA  brand and the U.S. divestiture of NUCYNTA  versus the gains recorded in 2014 from the divestitures of the Ortho-Clinical Diagnostics business and the K-Y  brand. Additionally, 2014 included an additional year of the Branded Prescription Drug Fee of $0.2 billion. As a percent to sales, consolidated earnings before provision for taxes on income in 2016 was 27.5% versus 27.4% in 2015. Cost of Products Sold and Selling, Marketing and Administrative Expenses: Cost of products sold and selling, marketing and administrative expenses as a percent to sales were as follows: ##TABLE_START % of Sales    Cost of products sold  30.2 %  30.7  30.6 Percent point increase/(decrease) over the prior year  (0.5 )  0.1  (0.7 ) Selling, marketing and administrative expenses  27.7 %  30.3  29.5 Percent point increase/(decrease) over the prior year  (2.6 )  0.8  (1.1 ) ##TABLE_ENDIn 2016, cost of products sold as a percent to sales decreased to 30.2% from 30.7% as compared to the same period a year ago. Favorable mix in the business and cost improvement programs was partially offset by the unfavorable impact of transactional currency. Intangible asset amortization expense of $1.2 billion was included in cost of products sold for 2016 and 2015. There was a decrease in the percent to sales of selling, marketing and administrative expenses in 2016 compared to the prior year, primarily due to cost management in all the segments and favorable mix. In 2015, cost of products sold as a percent to sales increased slightly as compared to the prior year. Favorable mix between the segments was offset by $81 million associated with the restructuring activity in the Medical Devices segment, negative transactional currency and lower sales of OLYSIO  /SOVRIAD  (simeprevir) in 2015. Intangible asset amortization expense included in cost of products sold for 2015 and 2014 was $1.2 billion and $1.4 billion, respectively. There was an increase in the percent to sales of selling, marketing and administrative expenses in 2015 compared to the prior year, primarily due to incremental investment spending in all the segments and the impact from lower sales of OLYSIO  /SOVRIAD  (simeprevir), partially offset by favorable mix and the inclusion of an additional year of the Branded Prescription Drug Fee of $0.2 billion in 2014.   ##TABLE_START  ##TABLE_END Research and Development Expense: Research and development expense by segment of business was as follows: ##TABLE_START     (Dollars in Millions)  Amount  % of Sales*  Amount  % of Sales*  Amount  % of Sales* Consumer  $  4.4 %   4.6   4.3 Pharmaceutical  6,967  20.8  6,821  21.7  6,213  19.2 Medical Devices  1,548  6.2  1,600  6.4  1,652  6.0 Total research and development expense  $ 9,095  12.7 %  9,046  12.9  8,494  11.4 Percent increase/(decrease) over the prior year  0.5 %    6.5    3.8   ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START * As a percent to segment sales ##TABLE_ENDResearch and development activities represent a significant part of the Company's business. These expenditures relate to the processes of discovering, testing and developing new products, upfront payments and milestones, improving existing products, as well as ensuring product efficacy and regulatory compliance prior to launch. The Company remains committed to investing in research and development with the aim of delivering high quality and innovative products. In 2016, worldwide costs of research and development activities increased by 0.5% compared to 2015 but decreased as a percent of sales. The decrease as a percent of sales was attributable to higher overall sales in the Pharmaceutical segment. The increased dollar spend in the Pharmaceutical segment was for investment spending to advance the pipeline. In 2015, worldwide costs of research and development activities increased by 6.5% compared to 2014. The increase as a percent to sales was attributable to increased investment spending primarily in the Pharmaceutical segment, lower overall sales and business mix. In-Process Research and Development (IPRD): In 2016, the Company recorded an IPRD charge of $29 million for the discontinuation of a development program related to Crucell. In 2015, the Company recorded an IPRD charge of $0.2 billion primarily for the discontinuation of certain development projects related to Covagen. In 2014, the Company recorded an IPRD charge of $0.2 billion for the impairment of various IPRD projects related to RespiVert, Crucell, Mentor and Synthes for the delay or discontinuation of certain development projects. Other (Income) Expense, Net: Other (income) expense, net is the account where the Company records gains and losses related to the sale and write-down of certain investments in equity securities held by Johnson  Johnson Innovation - JJDC, Inc. (JJDC), gains and losses on divestitures, transactional currency gains and losses, acquisition-related costs, litigation accruals and settlements, as well as royalty income. The change in other (income) expense, net for the fiscal year 2016 was an unfavorable change of $2.5 billion as compared to the prior year primarily due to higher gains on the sale of assets/businesses in the fiscal year 2015 as compared to 2016. The fiscal year of 2016 included gains of $0.6 billion from the divestitures of the controlled substance raw material and API business, certain anesthetic products in Europe and certain non-strategic Consumer brands versus gains of $2.6 billion recorded in 2015 primarily from the divestiture of the Cordis business, the U.S. divestiture of NUCYNTA  and the SPLENDA  brand. Additionally, the fiscal year of 2016 included higher litigation expense of $0.7 billion as compared to 2015. This was partially offset by a $0.3 billion intangible asset write-down related to Acclarent included the fiscal year 2015. The change in other (income) expense, net for the fiscal year 2015 was a favorable change of $2.0 billion as compared to the prior year primarily due to lower litigation expense of $1.1 billion, lower Synthes integration costs of $0.6 billion and higher JJDC portfolio gains of $0.2 billion as compared to the prior year. Additionally, the fiscal year 2015 included higher gains of $0.3 billion primarily from the divestitures of the Cordis business, the SPLENDA  brand and the U.S. divestiture of NUCYNTA  versus the gains recorded in 2014 from the divestitures of the Ortho-Clinical Diagnostics business and the K-Y  brand. This was partially offset by higher intangible asset write-downs of $0.1 billion in 2015. Interest (Income) Expense: Interest income in 2016 increased by $240 million as compared to 2015 due to a higher average balance of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities and higher interest rates. Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaled $41.9 billion at the end of 2016, and averaged $40.1 billion as compared to the $35.7 billion average cash balance in 2015. Interest expense in 2016 was higher as compared to 2015. The average debt balance was $23.5 billion in 2016 versus $19.3 billion in 2015. The total debt balance at the end of 2016 was $27.1 billion as compared to $19.9 billion at the end of 2015. The higher debt balance of approximately $7.2 billion was primarily due to increased borrowings in February and May of 2016. The Company increased borrowings, capitalizing on favorable terms in the capital markets. The proceeds of the borrowings were used for general corporate purposes, primarily the stock repurchase program. Interest income in 2015 increased by $61 million as compared to 2014 due to a higher average balance of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities and higher interest rates. Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaled  ##TABLE_START  ##TABLE_END $38.4 billion at the end of 2015, and averaged $35.7 billion as compared to the $31.1 billion average cash balance in 2014. The increase in the year-end cash balance was primarily due to cash generated from operating activities. Interest expense in 2015 increased slightly as compared to 2014. The average debt balance was $19.3 billion in 2015 versus $18.5 billion in 2014. The total debt balance at the end of 2015 was $19.9 billion as compared to $18.8 billion at the end of 2014. The higher debt balance of approximately $1.1 billion was an increase in commercial paper for general corporate purposes, primarily the stock repurchase program. Income Before Tax by Segment Income before tax by segment of business were as follows: ##TABLE_START   Income Before Tax  Segment Sales  Percent of Segment Sales (Dollars in Millions)       Consumer  $ 2,441  1,787  $ 13,307  13,507  18.3 %  13.2 Pharmaceutical  12,827  11,734  33,464  31,430  38.3  37.3 Medical Devices  5,578  6,826  25,119  25,137  22.2  27.2 Total (1)  20,846  20,347  71,890  70,074  29.0  29.0 Less: Expenses not allocated to segments (2)  1,043  1,151         Earnings before provision for taxes on income  $ 19,803  19,196  $ 71,890  70,074  27.5 %  27.4 ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (1)  See Note 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more details. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (2)  Amounts not allocated to segments include interest (income) expense and general corporate (income) expense. ##TABLE_END Consumer Segment: In 2016, the Consumer segment income before tax as a percent to sales was 18.3%, versus 13.2% in 2015, primarily driven by favorable selling, marketing and administrative expenses due to cost management and higher gross profit margins from cost improvement projects and favorable mix. This was partially offset by higher gains in 2015 related to divestitures, primarily the divestiture of the SPLENDA  brand. Additionally, operations in Venezuela negatively impacted the Consumer segment income before tax in 2016 as compared to 2015. In 2015, the Consumer segment income before tax as a percent to sales was 13.2%, versus 13.4% in 2014, primarily due to lower divestiture gains in 2015 versus 2014. In 2015, the Consumer segment tax included a gain of $0.3 billion from divestitures, primarily the divestiture of the SPLENDA  brand. In 2014, the Consumer segment included a gain $0.5 billion from divestitures, primarily the divestiture of the K-Y  brand. Pharmaceutical Segment: In 2016, the Pharmaceutical segment income before tax as a percent to sales was 38.3% versus 37.3% in 2015. The increase in income before tax was primarily due to strong sales volume growth and favorable selling, marketing and administrative expenses due to cost management. Additionally, the fiscal year 2015, had higher gains of $0.7 billion related to divestitures partially offset by a higher IPRD charge of $0.2 billion as compared to 2016. The fiscal year of 2016 included the gains from the divestitures of the controlled substance raw material and API business and certain anesthetic products in Europe versus the gains recorded in 2015 from the U.S. divestiture of NUCYNTA  . In 2015, the Pharmaceutical segment income before tax as a percent to sales was 37.3% versus 36.2% in 2014. The favorable income before tax was primarily due to higher gains recognized in 2015 partially offset by a sales decline of OLYSIO  /SOVRIAD  (simeprevir), increased investment spending and negative currency impacts as compared to 2014. Included in 2015 was a gain of $1.0 billion on the U.S. divestiture of NUCYNTA  , as well as receipt of a contingent payment and a positive adjustment to previous reserve estimates, including Managed Medicaid rebates. Additionally, the Pharmaceutical segment income before tax in 2014 was negatively impacted by $0.2 billion for an additional year of the Branded Prescription Drug Fee and higher intangible asset amortization expense of $0.3 billion primarily related to the write-down of INCIVO  (telaprevir). Medical Devices Segment: In 2016, the Medical Devices segment income before tax as a percent to sales was 22.2% versus 27.2% in 2015. The decrease in the income before tax as a percent to sales was primarily due to lower gains of $1.4 billion related to divestitures, higher litigation expense of $0.8 billion and a higher restructuring charge of $0.1 billion as compared to 2015. This was partially offset by an intangible asset write-down of $0.3 billion related to Acclarent in 2015 and favorable selling, marketing and administrative expenses in 2016. In 2015, the Medical Devices segment income before tax as a percent to sales was 27.2% versus 28.9% in 2014 primarily due to a restructuring charge of $0.6 billion, an intangible asset write-down of $0.3 billion related to Acclarent, and lower gains of $0.5 billion on divestitures as compared to 2014. In 2015, the Medical Devices segment included gains of $1.4 billion, primarily for the divestiture of the Cordis business versus a gain of $1.9 billion recorded in 2014 for the divestiture of the Ortho-Clinical Diagnostics business. The 2015 income before tax was favorably impacted by lower net litigation expense of  ##TABLE_START  ##TABLE_END $0.9 billion, which included a gain from the litigation settlement agreement of $0.6 billion with Guidant, and lower Synthes integration costs of $0.6 billion in 2015 as compared to 2014. Restructuring: The Company announced restructuring actions in its Medical Devices segment that are expected to result in annualized pre-tax cost savings of $800 million to $1.0 billion, the majority of which is expected to be realized by the end of 2018. Approximately $250 million in savings were realized in 2016. The savings will provide the Company with added flexibility and resources to fund investment in new growth opportunities and innovative solutions for customers and patients. The Company estimates that, in connection with its plans, it will record pre-tax restructuring related charges of approximately $2.0 billion to $2.4 billion, most of which are expected to be incurred by the end of 2017. In 2016, the Company recorded a pre-tax charge of $685 million, of which $45 million is included in cost of products sold and $149 million is included in other (income) expense. In 2015, the Company recorded a pre-tax charge of $590 million, of which $81 million was included in cost of products sold. Restructuring charges of $1.275 billion have been recorded since the restructuring was announced. See Note 22 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional details related to the restructuring. Provision for Taxes on Income: The worldwide effective income tax rate was 16.5% in 2016 , 19.7% in 2015 and 20.6% in 2014 . The 2016 effective tax rate decreased by 3.2% as compared to 2015. As described in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, the Company adopted a new accounting standard for the reporting of additional tax benefits on share-based compensation that vested or were exercised during the fiscal year. The adoption of this new standard reduced the effective tax rate for the fiscal 2016 by 1.8% versus 2015. The remainder of the change in the effective tax rate was primarily related to the lower earnings before taxes in the United States and the settlement of several uncertain tax positions in 2016 versus 2015. The decrease in the 2015 effective tax rate, as compared to 2014 was primarily attributable to the increases in taxable income in lower tax jurisdictions relative to higher tax jurisdictions and a tax benefit resulting from a restructuring of international affiliates. Additionally, the 2014 effective tax rate was affected by the items mentioned below. The increase in the 2014 effective tax rate, as compared to 2013, was attributable to the following: the divestiture of the Ortho-Clinical Diagnostics business at an approximate 44% effective tax rate, litigation accruals at low tax rates, the mix of earnings into higher tax jurisdictions, primarily the U.S., the accrual of an additional year of the Branded Prescription Drug Fee, which is not tax deductible, and additional U.S. tax expense related to a planned increase in dividends from current year foreign earnings as compared to the prior year. These increases to the 2014 effective tax rate were partially offset by a tax benefit of $0.4 billion associated with the Conor Medsystems divestiture. The 2014 effective tax rate was also reduced as the Company adjusted its unrecognized tax benefits as a result of (i) the federal appeals courts decision in OMJ Pharmaceuticals, Inc.s litigation regarding credits under former Section 936 of the Internal Revenue Code and (ii) a settlement of substantially all issues related to the Companys U.S. Internal Revenue Service audit of tax years 2006 - 2009. Liquidity and Capital Resources Liquidity  Cash Flows Cash and cash equivalents were $19.0 billion at the end of 2016 as compared to $13.7 billion at the end of 2015. The primary sources and uses of cash that contributed to the $5.3 billion increase were approximately $18.8 billion of cash generated from operating activities offset by $4.8 billion net cash used by investing activities, and $8.6 billion net cash used by financing activities, and $0.2 billion due to the effect on exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents. In addition, the Company had $22.9 billion in marketable securities at the end of 2016 and $24.6 billion at the end of 2015. See Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional details on cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities. Cash flow from operations of $18.8 billion was the result of $16.5 billion of net earnings and $4.9 billion of non-cash expenses and other adjustments for depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation and assets write-downs, reduced by $0.6 billion from net gains on sale of assets/businesses, $0.3 billion related to deferred taxes and $2.4 billion related to accounts receivable, inventories and other current and non-current liabilities. Additional sources of operating cash flow of $0.7 billion resulted from an increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities and a decrease in other current and non-current assets. Investing activities use of $4.8 billion was primarily for acquisitions, net of cash acquired of $4.5 billion and additions to property, plant and equipment of $3.2 billion. This was partially offset by proceeds from the net sale of investments primarily marketable securities of $1.8 billion and $1.3 billion of proceeds from the disposal of assets/businesses. Financing activities use of $8.6 billion was primarily for dividends to shareholders of $8.6 billion and $9.0 billion for the repurchase of common stock. Financing activities also included a source of $7.9 billion from net proceeds of short and long-term debt and $1.2 billion of proceeds from stock options exercised/employee withholding tax on stock awards, net. In 2016, the Company announced a definitive agreement to acquire Abbott Medical Optics Inc. for approximately $4.3 billion and on January 26, 2017, subsequent to year end the Company announced a definitive transaction agreement to acquire Actelion Ltd. for approximately $30.0 billion. Abbott Medical Optics closed on February 27, 2017. The Company will use cash held by the Company's foreign subsidiaries to pay for these acquisitions.  ##TABLE_START  ##TABLE_END On October 13, 2015, the Company announced that its Board of Directors approved a share repurchase program, authorizing the Company to purchase up to $10.0 billion of the Company's shares of common stock. As of January 1, 2017, $7.3 billion has been repurchased under the program. The repurchase program has no time limit and may be delayed or suspended for periods or discontinued at any time. Any shares acquired will be available for general corporate purposes. The Company intends to finance the share repurchase program through available cash and access to the capital markets. The previous share repurchase program approved on July 21, 2014, authorizing the Company to purchase up to $5.0 billion of the Company's shares of common stock, was completed on April 28, 2015. In 2016, the Company continued to have access to liquidity through the commercial paper market. The Company had a shelf registration with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission that expired on February 26, 2017. The Company plans to file a new shelf registration on February 27, 2017 which will enable it to issue debt securities on a timely basis. For additional details on borrowings, see Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The Company anticipates that operating cash flows, existing credit facilities and access to the capital markets will provide sufficient resources to fund operating needs in 2017. Concentration of Credit Risk Global concentration of credit risk with respect to trade accounts receivables continues to be limited due to the large number of customers globally and adherence to internal credit policies and credit limits. Economic challenges in Italy, Spain, Greece and Portugal (the Southern European Region) have impacted certain payment patterns, which have historically been longer than those experienced in the U.S. and other international markets. The total net trade accounts receivable balance in the Southern European Region was approximately $1.1 billion as of January 1, 2017 and $1.3 billion as of January 3, 2016. Approximately $0.7 billion as of January 1, 2017 and approximately $0.8 billion as of January 3, 2016 of the Southern European Region net trade accounts receivable balance related to the Company's Consumer, Vision Care and Diabetes Care businesses as well as certain Pharmaceutical and Medical Devices customers which are in line with historical collection patterns. The remaining balance of net trade accounts receivable in the Southern European Region has been negatively impacted by the timing of payments from certain government owned or supported health care customers, as well as certain distributors of the Pharmaceutical and Medical Devices local affiliates. The total net trade accounts receivable balance for these customers were approximately $0.4 billion at January 1, 2017 and $0.5 billion at January 3, 2016. The Company continues to receive payments from these customers and, in some cases, late payments with interest. For customers where payment is expected over periods of time longer than one year, revenue and trade receivables have been discounted over the estimated period of time for collection. Allowances for doubtful accounts have been increased for these customers, but have been immaterial to date. The Company will continue to work closely with these customers on payment plans, monitor the economic situation and take appropriate actions as necessary. Financing and Market Risk The Company uses financial instruments to manage the impact of foreign exchange rate changes on cash flows. Accordingly, the Company enters into forward foreign exchange contracts to protect the value of certain foreign currency assets and liabilities and to hedge future foreign currency transactions primarily related to product costs. Gains or losses on these contracts are offset by the gains or losses on the underlying transactions. A 10% appreciation of the U.S. Dollar from the January 1, 2017 market rates would increase the unrealized value of the Companys forward contracts by $23 million. Conversely, a 10% depreciation of the U.S. Dollar from the January 1, 2017 market rates would decrease the unrealized value of the Companys forward contracts by $28 million. In either scenario, the gain or loss on the forward contract would be offset by the gain or loss on the underlying transaction, and therefore, would have no impact on future anticipated earnings and cash flows. The Company hedges the exposure to fluctuations in currency exchange rates, and the effect on certain assets and liabilities in foreign currency, by entering into currency swap contracts. A 1% change in the spread between U.S. and foreign interest rates on the Companys interest rate sensitive financial instruments would either increase or decrease the unrealized value of the Companys swap contracts by approximately $82 million. In either scenario, at maturity, the gain or loss on the swap contract would be offset by the gain or loss on the underlying transaction, and therefore, would have no impact on future anticipated cash flows. The Company does not enter into financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes. Further, the Company has a policy of only entering into contracts with parties that have at least an investment grade credit rating. The counter-parties to these contracts are major financial institutions and there is no significant concentration of exposure with any one counter-party. Management believes the risk of loss is remote. The Company invests in both fixed rate and floating rate interest earning securities which carry a degree of interest rate risk. The fair market value of fixed rate securities may be adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates, while floating rate securities may produce less income than predicted if interest rates fall. A 1% (100 basis points) change in spread on the Companys interest rate sensitive investments would either increase or decrease the unrealized value of cash equivalents and current marketable securities by approximately $336 million.  ##TABLE_START  ##TABLE_END The Company has access to substantial sources of funds at numerous banks worldwide. In September 2016, the Company secured a new 364-day Credit Facility. Total credit available to the Company approximates $10 billion, which expires on September 14, 2017. Interest charged on borrowings under the credit line agreement is based on either bids provided by banks, the prime rate or London Interbank Offered Rates (LIBOR), plus applicable margins. Commitment fees under the agreement are not material. Total borrowings at the end of 2016 and 2015 were $27.1 billion and $19.9 billion, respectively. The increase in borrowings between 2016 and 2015 was a result of financing for the Company's share repurchase program and general corporate purposes. In 2016, net cash (cash and current marketable securities, net of debt) was $14.8 billion compared to net cash of $18.5 billion in 2015. Total debt represented 27.8% of total capital (shareholders equity and total debt) in 2016 and 21.8% of total capital in 2015. Shareholders equity per share at the end of 2016 was $26.02 compared to $25.82 at year-end 2015 , an increase of 0.8%. A summary of borrowings can be found in Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Contractual Obligations and Commitments The Companys contractual obligations are primarily for leases, debt and unfunded retirement plans. There are no other significant obligations. To satisfy these obligations, the Company will use cash from operations. The following table summarizes the Companys contractual obligations and their aggregate maturities as of January 1, 2017 (see Notes 7, 10 and 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further details): ##TABLE_START (Dollars in Millions)  Debt Obligations  Interest on Debt Obligations  Unfunded Retirement Plans  Operating Leases  Total  $ 1,704     2,802  1,561     2,559  2,538     3,441      1,436  1,795     2,557 After 2021  15,919  6,956    23,585 Total  $ 24,146  10,352  1,060   36,380 ##TABLE_ENDFor tax matters, see Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. For other retirement plan and post-employment medical benefit information, see Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The table does not include activity related to business combinations. Dividends The Company increased its dividend in 2016 for the 54th consecutive year. Cash dividends paid were $3.15 per share in 2016 compared with dividends of $2.95 per share in 2015 , and $2.76 per share in 2014 . The dividends were distributed as follows: ##TABLE_START    First quarter $ 0.75  0.70  0.66 Second quarter 0.80  0.75  0.70 Third quarter 0.80  0.75  0.70 Fourth quarter 0.80  0.75  0.70 Total $ 3.15  2.95  2.76 ##TABLE_ENDOn January 3, 2017, the Board of Directors declared a regular quarterly cash dividend of $0.80 per share, payable on March 14, 2017, to shareholders of record as of February 28, 2017. The Company expects to continue the practice of paying regular cash dividends. Other Information Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Managements discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition are based on the Companys consolidated financial statements that have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. (GAAP). The preparation of these financial statements requires that management make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported for revenues, expenses, assets, liabilities and other related disclosures. Actual results may or may  ##TABLE_START  ##TABLE_END not differ from these estimates. The Company believes that the understanding of certain key accounting policies and estimates are essential in achieving more insight into the Companys operating results and financial condition. These key accounting policies include revenue recognition, income taxes, legal and self-insurance contingencies, valuation of long-lived assets, assumptions used to determine the amounts recorded for pensions and other employee benefit plans and accounting for stock based awards. Revenue Recognition: The Company recognizes revenue from product sales when goods are shipped or delivered, and title and risk of loss pass to the customer. Provisions for certain rebates, sales incentives, trade promotions, coupons, product returns and discounts to customers are accounted for as reductions in sales in the same period the related sales are recorded. Product discounts granted are based on the terms of arrangements with direct, indirect and other market participants, as well as market conditions, including prices charged by competitors. Rebates, which include the Medicaid rebate provision, are estimated based on contractual terms, historical experience, patient outcomes, trend analysis and projected market conditions in the various markets served. The Company evaluates market conditions for products or groups of products primarily through the analysis of wholesaler and other third-party sell-through and market research data, as well as internally generated information. Sales returns are estimated and recorded based on historical sales and returns information. Products that exhibit unusual sales or return patterns due to dating, competition or other marketing matters are specifically investigated and analyzed as part of the accounting for sales return accruals. Sales returns allowances represent a reserve for products that may be returned due to expiration, destruction in the field, or in specific areas, product recall. The returns reserve is based on historical return trends by product and by market as a percent to gross sales. In accordance with the Companys accounting policies, the Company generally issues credit to customers for returned goods. The Companys sales returns reserves are accounted for in accordance with the U.S. GAAP guidance for revenue recognition when right of return exists. Sales returns reserves are recorded at full sales value. Sales returns in the Consumer and Pharmaceutical segments are almost exclusively not resalable. Sales returns for certain franchises in the Medical Devices segment are typically resalable but are not material. The Company infrequently exchanges products from inventory for returned products. The sales returns reserve for the total Company has been approximately 1.0% of annual net trade sales during the fiscal reporting years 2016 , 2015 and 2014 . Promotional programs, such as product listing allowances and cooperative advertising arrangements, are recorded in the year incurred. Continuing promotional programs include coupons and volume-based sales incentive programs. The redemption cost of consumer coupons is based on historical redemption experience by product and value. Volume-based incentive programs are based on estimated sales volumes for the incentive period and are recorded as products are sold. The Company also earns service revenue for co-promotion of certain products. For all years presented, service revenues were 1% or less of the total revenues and are included in sales to customers. These arrangements are evaluated to determine the appropriate amounts to be deferred or recorded as a reduction of revenue. In addition, the Company enters into collaboration arrangements that contain multiple revenue generating activities. Amounts due from collaborative partners for these arrangements are recognized as each activity is performed or delivered, based on the relative selling price. Upfront fees received as part of these arrangements are deferred and recognized over the performance period. See Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional disclosures on collaborations. Reasonably likely changes to assumptions used to calculate the accruals for rebates, returns and promotions are not anticipated to have a material effect on the financial statements. The Company currently discloses the impact of changes to assumptions in the quarterly or annual filing in which there is a material financial statement impact.  ##TABLE_START  ##TABLE_END Below are tables that show the progression of accrued rebates, returns, promotions, reserve for doubtful accounts and reserve for cash discounts by segment of business for the fiscal years ended January 1, 2017 and January 3, 2016 .

The Company estimates deferred tax assets and liabilities based on enacted tax regulations and rates. Future changes in tax laws and rates may affect recorded deferred tax assets and liabilities. The Company has unrecognized tax benefits for uncertain tax positions. The Company follows U.S. GAAP, which prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. Management believes that changes in these estimates would not have a material effect on the Company's results of operations, cash flows or financial position. At January 1, 2017 and January 3, 2016 , the cumulative amounts of undistributed international earnings were approximately $66.2 billion and $58.0 billion, respectively. At January 1, 2017 and January 3, 2016 , the Company's foreign subsidiaries held balances of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities in the amounts of $41.3 billion and $38.2 billion, respectively. The Company has not provided deferred taxes on the undistributed earnings from certain international subsidiaries where the earnings are considered to be indefinitely reinvested. The Company intends to continue to reinvest these earnings in international operations. If the Company decided at a later date to repatriate these earnings to the U.S., the Company would be required to provide for the net tax effects on these amounts. The Company does not determine the deferred tax liability associated with these undistributed earnings, as such determination is not practical. See Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding income taxes. Legal and Self Insurance Contingencies:  The Company records accruals for various contingencies, including legal proceedings and product liability claims as these arise in the normal course of business. The accruals are based on managements judgment as to the probability of losses and, where applicable, actuarially determined estimates. The Company has self insurance through a wholly-owned captive insurance company. In addition to accruals in the self insurance program, claims that exceed the insurance coverage are accrued when losses are probable and amounts can be reasonably estimated. Additionally, the Company records insurance receivable amounts from third-party insurers when recovery is probable. As appropriate, reserves against these receivables are recorded for estimated amounts that may not be collected from third-party insurers. The Company follows the provisions of U.S. GAAP when recording litigation related contingencies. A liability is recorded when a loss is probable and can be reasonably estimated. The best estimate of a loss within a range is accrued; however, if no estimate in the range is better than any other, the minimum amount is accrued.  ##TABLE_START  ##TABLE_END See Notes 1 and 21 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding product liability and legal proceedings. Long-Lived and Intangible Assets: The Company assesses changes in economic conditions and makes assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows in evaluating the value of the Companys property, plant and equipment, goodwill and intangible assets. As these assumptions and estimates may change over time, it may or may not be necessary for the Company to record impairment charges. Employee Benefit Plans: The Company sponsors various retirement and pension plans, including defined benefit, defined contribution and termination indemnity plans, which cover most employees worldwide. These plans are based on assumptions for the discount rate, expected return on plan assets, mortality rates, expected salary increases, health care cost trend rates and attrition rates. See Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further details on these rates and the effect a rate change to the health care cost trend would have on the Companys results of operations. Stock Based Compensation: The Company recognizes compensation expense associated with the issuance of equity instruments to employees for their services. Based on the type of equity instrument, the fair value is estimated on the date of grant using either the Black-Scholes option valuation model or a combination of both the Black-Scholes option valuation model and Monte Carlo valuation model, and is expensed in the financial statements over the service period. The input assumptions used in determining fair value are the expected life, expected volatility, risk-free rate and expected dividend yield. For performance share units the fair market value is calculated for each of the three component goals at the date of grant. The fair values for the sales and earnings per share goals of each performance share unit were estimated on the date of grant using the fair market value of the shares at the time of the award, discounted for dividends, which are not paid on the performance share units during the vesting period. The fair value for the relative total shareholder return goal of each performance share unit was estimated on the date of grant using the Monte Carlo valuation model. See Note 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. New Accounting Pronouncements Refer to Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for recently adopted accounting pronouncements and recently issued accounting pronouncements not yet adopted as of January 1, 2017 . Economic and Market Factors The Company is aware that its products are used in an environment where, for more than a decade, policymakers, consumers and businesses have expressed concerns about the rising cost of health care. In response to these concerns, the Company has a long-standing policy of pricing products responsibly. For the period 2006 - 2016, in the United States, the weighted average compound annual growth rate of the Companys net price increases for health care products (prescription and over-the-counter drugs, hospital and professional products) was below the U.S. Consumer Price Index (CPI). The Company operates in certain countries where the economic conditions continue to present significant challenges. The Company continues to monitor these situations and take appropriate actions. Inflation rates continue to have an effect on worldwide economies and, consequently, on the way companies operate. The Company has accounted for operations in Venezuela as highly inflationary, as the prior three-year cumulative inflation rate surpassed 100%. In the face of increasing costs, the Company strives to maintain its profit margins through cost reduction programs, productivity improvements and periodic price increases. The Venezuelan government has established alternative systems and offerings of various foreign currency exchanges. Through the fourth quarter of 2015, the number of the Companys transactions conducted at the official rate declined from prior quarters. As a result, the Company determined that it was no longer likely that all outstanding net monetary assets would be settled at the official government rate of 6.3 Bolivares Fuertes to one U.S. Dollar. Therefore in 2015, the Company recorded a charge of $161 million to revalue its net monetary assets in Venezuela at one of the governments alternative exchange rates (SIMADI) and impair its non-monetary assets. After the revaluation, as of January 3, 2016, the Companys Venezuelan subsidiaries represented less than 0.1% of the Company's consolidated assets and liabilities. While the Company continues to do business in Greece, the Company closely monitors the economic situation. As of January 1, 2017, the Companys Greek subsidiaries represented 0.3% and 0.4% of the Company's consolidated assets and revenues, respectively. On June 23, 2016, the United Kingdom (U.K.) held a referendum in which voters approved an exit from the European Union (E.U.), commonly referred to as Brexit. Given the lack of comparable precedent, it is unclear what financial, trade, regulatory and legal implications the withdrawal of the U.K. from the E.U. will have. Brexit creates global political and economic uncertainty, which may cause, among other consequences, volatility in exchange rates and interest rates, additional cost containment by third-party payors and changes in regulations. However, the Company currently does not believe that these and other related effects will have a material impact on the Companys consolidated financial position or operating results. As of January 1, 2017, the business of the Companys U.K. subsidiaries represented less than 3% of both the Companys consolidated assets and fiscal twelve months revenues.  ##TABLE_START  ##TABLE_END The Company is exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates. A 1% change in the value of the U.S. Dollar as compared to all foreign currencies in which the Company had sales, income or expense in 2016 would have increased or decreased the translation of foreign sales by approximately $330 million and income by $105 million. Governments around the world, including in the United States, consider various proposals to make changes to tax laws, which may include increasing or decreasing existing statutory tax rates. A change in statutory tax rate in any country would result in the revaluation of the Companys deferred tax assets and liabilities related to that particular jurisdiction in the period in which the new tax law is enacted. This change would result in an expense or benefit recorded to the Companys Consolidated Statement of Earnings. The Company closely monitors these proposals as they arise in the countries where it operates. Changes to the statutory tax rate may occur at any time, and any related expense or benefit recorded may be material to the fiscal quarter and year in which the law change is enacted. The Belgian government is currently considering a proposed change to its corporate tax code, including a proposal to lower its statutory tax rate. If enacted, the proposed change would result in revaluation of the Company's deferred tax assets, with a corresponding charge to tax expense that may have a material effect on the Companys results of operations for the period. Based on the deferred tax asset balances as of January 1, 2017, the Company estimates for every 1% that the statutory tax is lowered there will be additional one-time tax expense of approximately $60-75 million. A significant portion of the deferred tax asset described as International RD capitalized for tax in Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements is related to the Companys operations in Belgium. The U.S. government is currently considering various proposals to changes in its corporate tax code. These proposals include but are not limited to lowering the statutory tax rate and the rules on how international income earned by the Company is taxed in the U.S. The impact of these proposals may have a material effect on the Companys results of operations for the period and on future periods. As the Belgian or U.S. governments are still considering these proposals, it is not certain when or if they will be enacted. The Company faces various worldwide health care changes that may continue to result in pricing pressures that include health care cost containment and government legislation relating to sales, promotions and reimbursement of health care products. Changes in the behavior and spending patterns of purchasers of health care products and services, including delaying medical procedures, rationing prescription medications, reducing the frequency of physician visits and foregoing health care insurance coverage, as a result of the current global economic downturn, may continue to impact the Companys businesses. The Company also operates in an environment increasingly hostile to intellectual property rights. Firms have filed Abbreviated New Drug Applications or Biosimilar Biological Product Applications with the FDA or otherwise challenged the coverage and/or validity of the Company's patents, seeking to market generic or biosimilar forms of many of the Companys key pharmaceutical products prior to expiration of the applicable patents covering those products. In the event the Company is not successful in defending the patent claims challenged in the resulting lawsuits, generic or biosimilar versions of the products at issue will be introduced to the market, resulting in the potential for substantial market share and revenue losses for those products, and which may result in a non-cash impairment charge in any associated intangible asset. There is also a risk that one or more competitors could launch a generic or biosimilar version of the product at issue following regulatory approval even though one or more valid patents are in place. For further information, see the discussion on REMICADE  Related Cases and Litigation Against Filers of Abbreviated New Drug Applications in Note 21 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Legal Proceedings Johnson  Johnson and certain of its subsidiaries are involved in various lawsuits and claims regarding product liability, intellectual property, commercial and other matters; governmental investigations; and other legal proceedings that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of business. The Company records accruals for loss contingencies associated with these legal matters when it is probable that a liability will be incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. The Company has accrued for certain litigation matters and continues to monitor each related legal issue and adjust accruals for new information and further developments in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 450-20-25. For these and other litigation and regulatory matters currently disclosed for which a loss is probable or reasonably possible, the Company is unable to estimate the possible loss or range of loss beyond the amounts already accrued. Amounts accrued for legal contingencies often result from a complex series of judgments about future events and uncertainties that rely heavily on estimates and assumptions. The ability to make such estimates and judgments can be affected by various factors, including whether damages sought in the proceedings are unsubstantiated or indeterminate; scientific and legal discovery has not commenced or is not complete; proceedings are in early stages; matters present legal uncertainties; there are significant facts in dispute; or there are numerous parties involved. In the Company's opinion, based on its examination of these matters, its experience to date and discussions with counsel, the ultimate outcome of legal proceedings, net of liabilities accrued in the Company's balance sheet, is not expected to have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial position. However, the resolution of, or increase in accruals for, one or more of these matters in any reporting period may have a material adverse effect on the Company's results of operations and cash flows for that period. See Note 21 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding legal proceedings.  ##TABLE_START  ##TABLE_END Common Stock Market Prices The Companys Common Stock is listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol JNJ.

New Accounting Pronouncements Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements During the fiscal first quarter of 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update 2016-09 Compensation - Stock Compensation: Improvements to Employee Share Based Payment Accounting. The amendments in the update are effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016 and interim periods within those annual periods. Early adoption is permitted for any entity in any interim or annual period. During the fiscal second quarter of 2016, the Company elected to early adopt this standard. The update requires the following changes to presentation of the financial statements: ##TABLE_START  All excess tax benefits and deficiencies to be recognized as a reduction or an increase to the provision for taxes on income. Previously, the Company recorded these benefits directly to Retained Earnings. The tax benefit for the Company was $353 million for the fiscal year 2016. The standard does not permit retroactive presentation of this benefit to prior fiscal years on the Consolidated Statement of Earnings. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  The tax benefit or deficiency is required to be classified and presented as a cash flow to/from operating activities. It was previously required to be presented as a cash flow to/from financing activities on the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows. As permitted in the standard, the Company has elected to adopt this reclassification on a prospective basis and therefore prior fiscal years for the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows have not been recast for this provision. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Clarifies that all cash payments made to taxing authorities on employees share-based compensation should be classified as a cash outflow from financing activities. This reclassification is required to be recast retrospectively. As a result, for the fiscal year 2016, $269 million was classified as a cash outflow from financing activities and $290 million and $239 million , of cash outflow was reclassified from an operating activity to a financing activity (Proceeds from the exercise of stock options/employee withholding tax on stock awards, net) in the fiscal years 2015 and 2014, respectively. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  In the diluted net earnings per share calculation, when applying the treasury stock method for shares that could be repurchased, the assumed proceeds no longer include the amount of excess tax benefit. This did not have a material impact on the Company's diluted net earnings per share calculation. ##TABLE_END During the fiscal second quarter of 2015, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update 2015-03: Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs. This update requires capitalized debt issuance costs to be presented as a reduction to the carrying value of debt instead of being classified as a deferred charge. This update is effective for the Company for all annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2015 and is required to be applied retroactively for all periods presented. This update did not have a material impact on the presentation of the Companys financial position.  ##TABLE_START  ##TABLE_END During the fiscal third quarter of 2015, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update 2015-16 Business Combinations: Simplifying the Accounting for Measurement-Period Adjustments. The amendments in this update require that an acquirer recognize adjustments to provisional amounts that are identified during the measurement period in the reporting period in which the adjustment amounts are determined. This update is effective for the Company for all annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2015. The amendments in this update should be applied prospectively to adjustments to provisional amounts that occur after the effective date of this update with earlier application permitted for financial statements that have not been issued. This update did not have a material impact on the Companys consolidated financial statements. During the fiscal third quarter of 2014, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2014-15: Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entitys Ability to Continue as a Going Concern. This standard requires management to evaluate, for each annual and interim reporting period, whether there are conditions and events, considered in the aggregate, that raise substantial doubt about an entitys ability to continue as a going concern within one year after the date the financial statements are issued or are available to be issued. If substantial doubt is raised, additional disclosures around managements plan to alleviate these doubts are required. This update becomes effective for all annual periods and interim reporting periods ending after December 15, 2016. The adoption of this standard did not have any impact on the Companys current disclosures in the financial statements. Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements Not Adopted as of January 1, 2017 During the fiscal first quarter of 2017, the FASB issued Accounting Standard Update 2017-01: Clarifying the Definition of a Business. This update narrows the definition of a business by providing a screen to determine when an integrated set of assets and activities is not a business. The screen specifies that an integrated set of assets and activities is not a business if substantially all of the fair value of the gross assets acquired or disposed of is concentrated in a single or a group of similar identifiable assets. This update will be effective for the Company for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within those annual periods. Early adoption is permitted. This update should be applied prospectively. The Company is currently assessing the impact of the future adoption of this standard on its financial statements. During the fiscal first quarter of 2017, the FASB issued Accounting Standard Update 2017-04: Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment. This update simplifies how an entity is required to test goodwill for impairment. A goodwill impairment will now be measured by the amount by which a reporting units carrying value exceeds its fair value, not to exceed the carrying amount of goodwill. This update will be effective for the Company for its annual or any interim goodwill impairment tests in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019. Early adoption is permitted. This update should be applied prospectively. The Company is currently assessing the impact of the future adoption of this standard on its financial statements. During the fiscal first quarter of 2017, the FASB issued Accounting Standard Update 2017-05: Other Income-Gains and Losses from the Derecognition of Nonfinancial Assets. This update clarifies the scope of asset derecognition guidance, adds guidance for partial sales of nonfinancial assets and clarifies recognizing gains and losses from the transfer of nonfinancial assets in contracts with noncustomers. This update will be effective for the Company for its annual and interim reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, the same time as the amendments in Update 2014-09 Revenue from Contracts with Customers. This update allows the Company to choose either a full retrospective method or modified retrospective method upon adoption. The Company is currently assessing the impact of the future adoption of this standard on its financial statements. During the fiscal first quarter of 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update 2016-01 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities. The amendments in this update supersede the guidance to classify equity securities with readily determinable fair values into different categories (that is, trading or available-for-sale) and require equity securities to be measured at fair value with changes in the fair value recognized through net income. The standard amends financial reporting by providing relevant information about an entitys equity investments and reducing the number of items that are recognized in other comprehensive income. This update will be effective for the Company for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods within those annual periods. The Company is unable to estimate the impact of the future adoption of this standard on its financial statements as it will depend on the equity investments as of the adoption date. During the fiscal first quarter of 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update 2016-02 Leases (Topic 842). This update requires the recognition of lease assets and lease liabilities on the balance sheet for all lease obligations and disclosing key information about leasing arrangements. This update requires the recognition of lease assets and lease liabilities by lessees for those leases classified as operating leases under current generally accepted accounting principles. This update will be effective for the Company for all annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early application is permitted. The update is required to be adopted using a modified retrospective approach. The Company anticipates that most of its operating leases will result in  the recognition of additional assets and the corresponding liabilities on its Consolidated Balance Sheets, however does not expect to have a material impact on the financial position.  The actual impact will depend on the Company's lease portfolio at the time of adoption. The Company continues to assess all implications of the standard and related financial disclosures.  ##TABLE_START  ##TABLE_END During the fiscal first quarter of 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update 2016-07 Investments - Equity Method and Joint Ventures (Topic 323): Simplifying the Transition to the Equity Method of Accounting. The amendments in the update eliminate the requirement that when an investment qualifies for the use of the equity method as a result of an increase in the level of ownership interest or degree of influence, an investor must adjust the investment, results of operations, and retained earnings retroactively on a step by step basis as if the equity method had been in effect during all previous periods that the investment had been held. The amendments in this update are effective for all entities for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2016. The amendments should be applied prospectively upon their effective date to increases in the level of ownership interest or degree of influence that result in the application of the equity method. Earlier adoption is permitted for any entity in any interim or annual period. The adoption of this standard is not expected to have a material impact on the presentation of the Company's consolidated financial statements. During the fiscal third quarter of 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update 2016-15 Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments. This update addresses whether to present certain specific cash flow items as operating, investing or financing activities. The amendments in this update are effective for public entities for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2017. Early adoption is permitted, including adoption in an interim period. The Company is currently assessing the impact of the future adoption of this standard on its consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. During the fiscal fourth quarter of 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update 2016-16 Income Taxes (Topic 740): Intra-Entity Transfers of Assets Other Than Inventory. This update removes the current exception in US GAAP prohibiting entities from recognizing current and deferred income tax expenses or benefits related to transfer of assets, other than inventory, within the consolidated entity. The current exception to defer the recognition of any tax impact on the transfer of inventory within the consolidated entity until it is sold to a third party remains unaffected. The amendments in this update are effective for public entities for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017. Early adoption is permitted and should be in the first interim period if an entity issues interim financial statements. The Company is currently assessing the impact of the future adoption of this standard on its consolidated financial statements. During the fiscal second quarter of 2015, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update 2015-11: Simplifying the Measurement of Inventory. This update requires inventory to be measured at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Net realizable value is the estimated selling prices in the ordinary course of business, less reasonably predictable costs of completion, disposal and transportation. This update will be effective for the Company for all annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2016. The amendments in this update should be applied prospectively with earlier application permitted as of the beginning of an interim or annual reporting period. This update will not have a material impact on the presentation of the Companys financial position. During the fiscal second quarter of 2014, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update 2014-09: Revenue from Contracts with Customers, which, along with amendments issued in 2015 and 2016, will replace substantially all current U.S. GAAP guidance on this topic and eliminate industry-specific guidance. Early adoption of this standard is permitted but not before the original effective date for all annual periods and interim reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017. The guidance permits two methods of adoption: full retrospective method (retrospective application to each prior reporting period presented) or modified retrospective method (retrospective application with the cumulative effect of initially applying the guidance recognized at the date of initial application and providing certain additional disclosures). While the Company continues to evaluate the effect of the standard, preliminarily, it does not anticipate a material impact on its financial statements. To complete the assessment of the impact of the standard to the financial statements, the Company continues to assess all implications of the standard, method of adoption and related financial disclosures. Additionally, the Company continues to monitor modifications, clarifications and interpretations issued by the FASB that may affect current conclusions. Cash Equivalents The Company classifies all highly liquid investments with stated maturities of three months or less from date of purchase as cash equivalents and all highly liquid investments with stated maturities of greater than three months from the date of purchase as current marketable securities. The Company has a policy of making investments only with commercial institutions that have at least an investment grade credit rating. The Company invests its cash primarily in government securities and obligations, corporate debt securities, money market funds and reverse repurchase agreements (RRAs). RRAs are collateralized by deposits in the form of Government Securities and Obligations for an amount not less than 102% of their value. The Company does not record an asset or liability as the Company is not permitted to sell or repledge the associated collateral. The Company has a policy that the collateral has at least an A (or equivalent) credit rating. The Company utilizes a third party custodian to manage the exchange of funds and ensure that collateral received is maintained at 102% of the value of the RRAs on a daily basis. RRAs with stated maturities of greater than three months from the date of purchase are classified as marketable securities. Investments Investments classified as held to maturity investments are reported at amortized cost and realized gains or losses are reported in earnings. Investments classified as available-for-sale are carried at estimated fair value with unrealized gains and losses  ##TABLE_START  ##TABLE_END recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income. Available-for-sale securities available for current operations are classified as current assets otherwise, they are classified as long term. Management determines the appropriate classification of its investment in debt and equity securities at the time of purchase and re-evaluates such determination at each balance sheet date. The Company periodically reviews its investments in equity securities for impairment and adjusts these investments to their fair value when a decline in market value is deemed to be other than temporary. If losses on these securities are considered to be other than temporary, the loss is recognized in earnings. Property, Plant and Equipment and Depreciation Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost. The Company utilizes the straight-line method of depreciation over the estimated useful lives of the assets: ##TABLE_START Building and building equipment 20 - 30 years Land and leasehold improvements 10 - 20 years Machinery and equipment 2 - 13 years ##TABLE_ENDThe Company capitalizes certain computer software and development costs, included in machinery and equipment, when incurred in connection with developing or obtaining computer software for internal use. Capitalized software costs are amortized over the estimated useful lives of the software, which generally range from 3 to 8 years. The Company reviews long-lived assets to assess recoverability using undiscounted cash flows. When certain events or changes in operating or economic conditions occur, an impairment assessment may be performed on the recoverability of the carrying value of these assets. If the asset is determined to be impaired, the loss is measured based on the difference between the assets fair value and its carrying value. If quoted market prices are not available, the Company will estimate fair value using a discounted value of estimated future cash flows. Revenue Recognition The Company recognizes revenue from product sales when the goods are shipped or delivered and title and risk of loss pass to the customer. Provisions for certain rebates, sales incentives, trade promotions, coupons, product returns and discounts to customers are accounted for as reductions in sales in the same period the related sales are recorded. Product discounts granted are based on the terms of arrangements with direct, indirect and other market participants, as well as market conditions, including prices charged by competitors. Rebates, which include Medicaid, are estimated based on contractual terms, historical experience, patient outcomes, trend analysis and projected market conditions in the various markets served. The Company evaluates market conditions for products or groups of products primarily through the analysis of wholesaler and other third-party sell-through and market research data, as well as internally generated information. Sales returns are generally estimated and recorded based on historical sales and returns information. Products that exhibit unusual sales or return patterns due to dating, competition or other marketing matters are specifically investigated and analyzed as part of the accounting for sales returns accruals. Sales returns allowances represent a reserve for products that may be returned due to expiration, destruction in the field, or in specific areas, product recall. The returns reserve is based on historical return trends by product and by market as a percent to gross sales. In accordance with the Companys accounting policies, the Company generally issues credit to customers for returned goods. The Companys sales returns reserves are accounted for in accordance with U.S. GAAP guidance for revenue recognition when right of return exists. Sales returns reserves are recorded at full sales value. Sales returns in the Consumer and Pharmaceutical segments are almost exclusively not resalable. Sales returns for certain franchises in the Medical Devices segment are typically resalable but are not material. The Company infrequently exchanges products from inventory for returned products. The sales returns reserve for the total Company has been approximately 1.0% of annual sales to customers during the fiscal reporting years 2016 , 2015 and 2014 . Promotional programs, such as product listing allowances and cooperative advertising arrangements, are recorded in the year incurred. Continuing promotional programs include coupons and volume-based sales incentive programs. The redemption cost of consumer coupons is based on historical redemption experience by product and value. Volume-based incentive programs are based on the estimated sales volumes for the incentive period and are recorded as products are sold. The Company also earns service revenue for co-promotion of certain products and includes it in sales to customers. These arrangements are evaluated to determine the appropriate amounts to be deferred or recorded as a reduction of revenue. Shipping and Handling Shipping and handling costs incurred were $974 million , $996 million and $1,068 million in 2016 , 2015 and 2014 , respectively, and are included in selling, marketing and administrative expense. The amount of revenue received for shipping and handling is less than 0.5% of sales to customers for all periods presented. Inventories Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market determined by the first-in, first-out method.  ##TABLE_START  ##TABLE_END Intangible Assets and Goodwill The authoritative literature on U.S. GAAP requires that goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives be assessed annually for impairment. The Company completed the annual impairment test for 2016 in the fiscal fourth quarter. Future impairment tests will be performed annually in the fiscal fourth quarter, or sooner if warranted. Purchased in-process research and development is accounted for as an indefinite lived intangible asset until the underlying project is completed, at which point the intangible asset will be accounted for as a definite lived intangible asset, or abandoned, at which point the intangible asset will be written off or partially impaired. Intangible assets that have finite useful lives continue to be amortized over their useful lives, and are reviewed for impairment when warranted by economic conditions. See Note 5 for further details on Intangible Assets and Goodwill. Financial Instruments As required by U.S. GAAP, all derivative instruments are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value. Fair value is the exit price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability. Fair value is a market-based measurement determined using assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability. The authoritative literature establishes a three-level hierarchy to prioritize the inputs used in measuring fair value, with Level 1 having the highest priority and Level 3 having the lowest. Changes in the fair value of derivatives are recorded each period in current earnings or other comprehensive income, depending on whether the derivative is designated as part of a hedge transaction, and if so, the type of hedge transaction. The Company documents all relationships between hedged items and derivatives. The overall risk management strategy includes reasons for undertaking hedge transactions and entering into derivatives. The objectives of this strategy are: (1) minimize foreign currency exposures impact on the Companys financial performance; (2) protect the Companys cash flow from adverse movements in foreign exchange rates; (3) ensure the appropriateness of financial instruments; and (4) manage the enterprise risk associated with financial institutions. See Note 6 for additional information on Financial Instruments. Product Liability Accruals for product liability claims are recorded, on an undiscounted basis, when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the liability can be reasonably estimated based on existing information and actuarially determined estimates where applicable. The accruals are adjusted periodically as additional information becomes available. The Company accrues an estimate of the legal defense costs needed to defend each matter when those costs are probable and can be reasonably estimated. As a result of cost and availability factors, effective November 1, 2005, the Company ceased purchasing third-party product liability insurance. The Company has self insurance through a wholly-owned captive insurance company. In addition to accruals in the self insurance program, claims that exceed the insurance coverage are accrued when losses are probable and amounts can be reasonably estimated. Based on the availability of prior coverage, receivables for insurance recoveries related to product liability claims are recorded on an undiscounted basis, when it is probable that a recovery will be realized. As appropriate, reserves against these receivables are recorded for estimated amounts that may not be collected from third-party insurers. Concentration of Credit Risk Global concentration of credit risk with respect to trade accounts receivables continues to be limited due to the large number of customers globally and adherence to internal credit policies and credit limits. Economic challenges in Italy, Spain, Greece and Portugal (the Southern European Region) have impacted certain payment patterns, which have historically been longer than those experienced in the U.S. and other international markets. The total net trade accounts receivable balance in the Southern European Region was approximately $1.1 billion as of January 1, 2017 and approximately $1.3 billion as of January 3, 2016 . Approximately $0.7 billion as of January 1, 2017 and approximately $0.8 billion as of January 3, 2016 of the Southern European Region net trade accounts receivable balance related to the Company's Consumer, Vision Care and Diabetes Care businesses as well as certain Pharmaceutical and Medical Devices customers which are in line with historical collection patterns. The remaining balance of net trade accounts receivable in the Southern European Region has been negatively impacted by the timing of payments from certain government owned or supported health care customers, as well as certain distributors of the Pharmaceutical and Medical Devices local affiliates. The total net trade accounts receivable balance for these customers were approximately $0.4 billion at January 1, 2017 and $0.5 billion at January 3, 2016 . The Company continues to receive payments from these customers and, in some cases, late payments with interest. For customers where payment is expected over periods of time longer than one year, revenue and trade receivables have been discounted over the estimated period of time for collection. Allowances for doubtful accounts have been increased for these customers, but have been immaterial to date. The Company will continue to work closely with these customers on payment plans, monitor the economic situation and take appropriate actions as necessary.  ##TABLE_START  ##TABLE_END Research and Development Research and development expenses are expensed as incurred. Upfront and milestone payments made to third parties in connection with research and development collaborations are expensed as incurred up to the point of regulatory approval. Payments made to third parties subsequent to regulatory approval are capitalized and amortized over the remaining useful life of the related product. Amounts capitalized for such payments are included in other intangibles, net of accumulated amortization. The Company enters into collaborative arrangements, typically with other pharmaceutical or biotechnology companies, to develop and commercialize drug candidates or intellectual property. These arrangements typically involve two (or more) parties who are active participants in the collaboration and are exposed to significant risks and rewards dependent on the commercial success of the activities. These collaborations usually involve various activities by one or more parties, including research and development, marketing and selling and distribution. Often, these collaborations require upfront, milestone and royalty or profit share payments, contingent upon the occurrence of certain future events linked to the success of the asset in development. Amounts due from collaborative partners related to development activities are generally reflected as a reduction of research and development expense because the performance of contract development services is not central to the Companys operations. In general, the income statement presentation for these collaborations is as follows: ##TABLE_START Nature/Type of Collaboration  Statement of Earnings Presentation Third-party sale of product  Sales to customers Royalties/milestones paid to collaborative partner (post-regulatory approval)*  Cost of products sold Royalties received from collaborative partner  Other income (expense), net Upfront payments  milestones paid to collaborative partner (pre-regulatory approval)  Research and development expense Research and development payments to collaborative partner  Research and development expense Research and development payments received from collaborative partner  Reduction of Research and development expense ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START * Milestones are capitalized as intangible assets and amortized to cost of goods sold over the useful life. ##TABLE_ENDFor all years presented, there was no individual project that represented greater than 5% of the total annual consolidated research and development expense. The Company has a number of products and compounds developed in collaboration with strategic partners including XARELTO  , co-developed with Bayer HealthCare AG and IMBRUVICA  , developed in collaboration and co-marketed with Pharmacyclics LLC, an AbbVie company.  Advertising Costs associated with advertising are expensed in the year incurred and are included in selling, marketing and administrative expenses. Advertising expenses worldwide, which comprised television, radio, print media and Internet advertising, were $2.4 billion , $2.5 billion and $2.6 billion in 2016 , 2015 and 2014 , respectively. Income Taxes Income taxes are recorded based on amounts refundable or payable for the current year and include the results of any difference between U.S. GAAP accounting and tax reporting, recorded as deferred tax assets or liabilities. The Company estimates deferred tax assets and liabilities based on enacted tax regulations and rates. Future changes in tax laws and rates may affect recorded deferred tax assets and liabilities in the future. The Company has unrecognized tax benefits for uncertain tax positions. The Company follows U.S. GAAP which prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. Management believes that changes in these estimates would not have a material effect on the Company's results of operations, cash flows or financial position. At January 1, 2017 and January 3, 2016 , the cumulative amounts of undistributed international earnings were approximately $66.2 billion and $58.0 billion , respectively. At January 1, 2017 and January 3, 2016 , the Company's foreign subsidiaries held balances of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities in the amounts of $41.3 billion and $38.2 billion , respectively. The Company has not provided deferred taxes on the undistributed earnings from certain international subsidiaries where the earnings are considered to be indefinitely reinvested. The Company intends to continue to reinvest these earnings in international operations. If the Company decided at a later date to repatriate these earnings to the U.S., the Company would be required to provide for the net tax effects on these amounts. The Company does not determine the deferred tax liability associated with these undistributed earnings, as such determination is not practical. See Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding income taxes.  ##TABLE_START  ##TABLE_END Net Earnings Per Share Basic earnings per share is computed by dividing net earnings available to common shareholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the period. Diluted earnings per share reflects the potential dilution that could occur if securities were exercised or converted into common stock using the treasury stock method. Use of Estimates The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported. Estimates are used when accounting for sales discounts, rebates, allowances and incentives, product liabilities, income taxes, depreciation, amortization, employee benefits, contingencies and intangible asset and liability valuations. Actual results may or may not differ from those estimates. The Company follows the provisions of U.S. GAAP when recording litigation related contingencies. A liability is recorded when a loss is probable and can be reasonably estimated. The best estimate of a loss within a range is accrued; however, if no estimate in the range is better than any other, the minimum amount is accrued. Annual Closing Date The Company follows the concept of a fiscal year, which ends on the Sunday nearest to the end of the month of December. Normally each fiscal year consists of 52 weeks, but every five or six years the fiscal year consists of 53 weeks , and therefore includes additional shipping days, as was the case in 2015, and will be the case again in 2020. Reclassification Certain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to current year presentation.  ##TABLE_START  ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START 2.

The estimated amortization expense, including Abbott Medical Optics (AMO), for the five succeeding years approximates $1.5 billion before tax, per year. Intangible asset write-downs are included in Other (income) expense, net. See Note 20 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional details related to acquisitions and divestitures. ##TABLE_START 6. Fair Value Measurements ##TABLE_END The Company uses forward foreign exchange contracts to manage its exposure to the variability of cash flows, primarily related to the foreign exchange rate changes of future intercompany products and third-party purchases of materials denominated in a foreign currency. The Company uses cross currency interest rate swaps to manage currency risk primarily related to borrowings. The Company also uses equity collar contracts to manage exposure to market risk associated with certain equity investments. All three types of derivatives are designated as cash flow hedges. Additionally, the Company uses interest rate swaps as an instrument to manage interest rate risk related to fixed rate borrowings. These derivatives are treated as fair value hedges. The Company uses forward foreign exchange contracts designated as net investment hedges. Additionally, the Company uses forward foreign exchange contracts to offset its exposure to certain foreign currency assets and liabilities. These forward foreign exchange contracts are not designated as hedges and therefore, changes in the fair values of these derivatives are recognized in earnings, thereby offsetting the current earnings effect of the related foreign currency assets and liabilities. The Company does not enter into derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes, or that contain credit risk related contingent features or requirements to post collateral (excluding equity collar contract) by either the Company or the counter-party. For equity collar contracts, the Company pledged the underlying hedged marketable equity securities to the counter-party as collateral. On an ongoing basis, the Company monitors counterparty credit ratings. The Company considers credit non-performance risk to be low, because the Company primarily enters into agreements with commercial institutions that have at least an investment grade credit rating. Refer to the table on significant financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value contained in this footnote for receivables and payables with these commercial institutions. As of January 1, 2017 , the Company had notional amounts outstanding for forward foreign exchange contracts, cross currency interest rate swaps, interest rate swaps and equity collar contracts of $36.0 billion , $2.3 billion , $1.8 billion and $0.3 billion respectively. All derivative instruments are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value. Changes in the fair value of derivatives are recorded each period in current earnings or other comprehensive income, depending on whether the derivative is designated as part of a hedge transaction, and if so, the type of hedge transaction. The designation as a cash flow hedge is made at the entrance date of the derivative contract. At inception, all derivatives are expected to be highly effective. Changes in the fair value of a derivative that is designated as a cash flow hedge and is highly effective are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income until the underlying transaction affects earnings, and are then reclassified to earnings in the same account as the hedged transaction. Gains and losses associated with interest rate swaps and changes in fair value of hedged debt attributable to changes in interest rates are recorded to interest expense in the period in which they occur. Gains and losses on net investment hedges are accounted for through the currency translation account. On an ongoing basis, the Company assesses whether each derivative continues to be highly effective in offsetting changes of hedged items. If and when a derivative is no longer expected to be highly effective, hedge accounting is discontinued. Hedge ineffectiveness, if any, is included in current period earnings in Other (income) expense, net for forward foreign exchange contracts, cross currency interest rate swaps, net investment hedges and equity collar contracts. For interest rate swaps designated as fair value hedges, hedge ineffectiveness, if any, is included in current period earnings within interest expense. For the current reporting period, hedge ineffectiveness associated with interest rate swaps was not material. During the fiscal second quarter of 2016, the Company designated its Euro denominated notes issued in May 2016 with due dates ranging from 2022 to 2035 as a net investment hedge of the Company's investments in certain of its international subsidiaries that use the Euro as their functional currency in order to reduce the volatility caused by changes in exchange rates. During 2016, the change in the carrying value due to remeasurement of these Euro notes resulted in a $375 million pretax gain reflected in foreign currency translation adjustment, within the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income. As of January 1, 2017 , the balance of deferred net losses on derivatives included in accumulated other comprehensive income was $285 million after-tax. For additional information, see the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income and Note 13. The Company expects that substantially all of the amounts related to forward foreign exchange contracts will be reclassified into earnings over the next 12 months as a result of transactions that are expected to occur over that period. The maximum length of time over which the Company is hedging transaction exposure is 18 months , excluding interest rate contracts, net investment hedges and equity collar contracts. The amount ultimately realized in earnings may differ as foreign exchange rates change. Realized gains and losses are ultimately determined by actual exchange rates at maturity of the derivative.  ##TABLE_START  ##TABLE_END The following table is a summary of the activity related to derivatives designated as cash flow hedges for the fiscal years ended January 1, 2017 and January 3, 2016 : ##TABLE_START (Dollars in Millions)  Gain/(Loss) Recognized In Accumulated OCI (1)  Gain/(Loss) Reclassified From Accumulated OCI Into Income (1)  Gain/(Loss) Recognized In Other Income/Expense (2) Cash Flow Hedges by Income Statement Caption       Sales to customers (3)  $ (65 )  (83 )  (47 )  (126 )  (1 )  (5 ) Cost of products sold (3)  (212 )  (22 )  (3 )   (15 )  Research and development expense (3)  (76 )  (3 )  (90 )     Interest (income)/Interest expense, net (4)   (40 )        Other (income) expense, net (3) (5)  (72 )   (7 )    Total  $ (359 )  (115 )  (110 )   (14 )  ##TABLE_ENDAll amounts shown in the table above are net of tax. ##TABLE_START (1)  Effective portion ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (2)  Ineffective portion ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (3)  Forward foreign exchange contracts ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (4)  Cross currency interest rate swaps  ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (5)  Includes equity collar contracts ##TABLE_END For the fiscal years ended January 1, 2017 and January 3, 2016 , a loss of $56 million and a loss of $34 million , respectively, was recognized in Other (income) expense, net, relating to forward foreign exchange contracts not designated as hedging instruments. Fair value is the exit price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability. Fair value is a market-based measurement determined using assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability. The authoritative literature establishes a three-level hierarchy to prioritize the inputs used in measuring fair value. The levels within the hierarchy are described below with Level 1 having the highest priority and Level 3 having the lowest. The fair value of a derivative financial instrument (i.e. forward foreign exchange contracts, interest rate contracts) is the aggregation by currency of all future cash flows discounted to its present value at the prevailing market interest rates and subsequently converted to the U.S. Dollar at the current spot foreign exchange rate. The Company does not believe that fair values of these derivative instruments materially differ from the amounts that could be realized upon settlement or maturity, or that the changes in fair value will have a material effect on the Companys results of operations, cash flows or financial position. The Company also holds equity investments which are classified as Level 1 and debt securities which are classified as Level 2. The Company did not have any other significant financial assets or liabilities which would require revised valuations under this standard that are recognized at fair value. The following three levels of inputs are used to measure fair value: Level 1  Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities. Level 2  Significant other observable inputs. Level 3  Significant unobservable inputs. The Companys significant financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value as of January 1, 2017 and January 3, 2016 were as follows:  ##TABLE_START  ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START    (Dollars in Millions)  Level 1  Level 2  Level 3  Total  Total (1) Derivatives designated as hedging instruments:           Assets:           Forward foreign exchange contracts (7)  $       Interest rate contracts (2)(4)(7)        Total        Liabilities:           Forward foreign exchange contracts (8)        Interest rate contracts (3)(4)(8)        Equity collar contracts (8)         Total    1,162    1,162  Derivatives not designated as hedging instruments:           Assets:           Forward foreign exchange contracts (7)        Liabilities:           Forward foreign exchange contracts (8)        Available For Sale Other Investments:           Equity investments (5)  1,209      1,209  1,494 Debt securities (6)  $   12,087    12,087  8,316 ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (1)  2015 assets and liabilities are all classified as Level 2 with the exception of equity investments of $1,494 million , which are classified as Level 1. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (2)  Includes $23 million and $20 million of non-current assets for the fiscal years ending January 1, 2017 and January 3, 2016 , respectively. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (3)  Includes $382 million and $239 million of non-current liabilities for the fiscal years ending January 1, 2017 and January 3, 2016 , respectively. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (4)  Includes cross currency interest rate swaps and interest rate swaps. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (5)  Classified as non-current other assets with the exception of $332 million of current assets for January 1, 2017.

The Company has access to substantial sources of funds at numerous banks worldwide. In September 2016 , the Company secured a new 364-day Credit Facility. Total credit available to the Company approximates $10 billion , which expires on September 14, 2017 . Interest charged on borrowings under the credit line agreements is based on either bids provided by banks, the prime rate or London Interbank Offered Rates (LIBOR), plus applicable margins. Commitment fees under the agreements are not material. Throughout 2016 , the Company continued to have access to liquidity through the commercial paper market. Short-term borrowings and the current portion of long-term debt amounted to approximately $4.7 billion at the end of 2016 , of which $2.7 billion was borrowed under the Commercial Paper Program. The remainder principally represents local borrowing by international subsidiaries. Throughout 2015, the Company continued to have access to liquidity through the commercial paper market. Short-term borrowings and the current portion of long-term debt amounted to approximately $7.0 billion at the end of 2015, of which $4.6 billion was borrowed under the Commercial Paper Program.

The 2016 effective tax rate decreased by 3.2% as compared to 2015. As described in Note 1, the Company adopted a new accounting standard for the reporting of additional tax benefits on share-based compensation that vested or were exercised during the fiscal year. The adoption of this new standard reduced the effective tax rate of fiscal 2016 by 1.8% versus 2015. The remainder of the change in the effective tax rate was primarily related to the lower earnings before taxes in the United States and the settlement of several uncertain tax positions in 2016 versus 2015. The decrease in the 2015 effective tax rate, as compared to 2014, was primarily attributable to the increases in taxable income in lower tax jurisdictions relative to higher tax jurisdictions and a tax benefit resulting from a restructuring of international affiliates. Additionally, the 2014 effective tax rate was affected by the items mentioned below. The increase in the 2014 effective tax rate, as compared to 2013, was attributable to the following: the divestiture of the Ortho-Clinical Diagnostics business at an approximate 44% effective tax rate, litigation accruals at low tax rates, the mix of earnings into higher tax jurisdictions, primarily the U.S., the accrual of an additional year of the Branded Prescription Drug Fee, which is not tax deductible, and additional U.S. tax expense related to a planned increase in dividends from current year foreign earnings as compared to the prior year. These increases to the 2014 effective tax rate were partially offset by a tax benefit of $0.4 billion associated with the Conor Medsystems divestiture. The 2014 effective tax rate was also reduced as the Company adjusted its unrecognized tax benefits as a result of (i) the federal appeals courts decision in OMJ Pharmaceuticals, Inc.s litigation regarding credits under former Section 936 of the Internal Revenue Code and (ii) a settlement of substantially all issues related to the Companys U.S. Internal Revenue Service audit of tax years 2006 - 2009. The impact of the settlement is reflected in the U.S. tax on international income and the All other line items within the above reconciliation. The items noted above reflect the key drivers of the rate reconciliation.  ##TABLE_START  ##TABLE_END Temporary differences and carryforwards for 2016 and 2015 were as follows: ##TABLE_START   2016 Deferred Tax  2015 Deferred Tax (Dollars in Millions)  Asset  Liability  Asset  Liability Employee related obligations  $ 2,958   2,863  Stock based compensation     Depreciation   (219 )   (247 ) Non-deductible intangibles   (6,672 )   (6,663 ) International RD capitalized for tax  1,264   1,318  Reserves  liabilities  1,857   1,801  Income reported for tax purposes  1,309    Net operating loss carryforward international     Miscellaneous international  1,135  (15 )  (1)  (249 ) Miscellaneous U.S.     Total deferred income taxes  $ 10,144  (6,906 )  10,087  (7,159 ) ##TABLE_END(1) Net of a valuation allowance related to Belgium of $196 million . In 2016, this allowance was reversed and the related deferred tax asset was utilized to reduce current tax expense. The Company has wholly-owned international subsidiaries that have cumulative net losses. The Company believes that it is more likely than not that these subsidiaries will realize future taxable income sufficient to utilize these deferred tax assets. The following table summarizes the activity related to unrecognized tax benefits: ##TABLE_START (Dollars in Millions)    Beginning of year  $ 3,080  2,465  2,729 Increases related to current year tax positions    Increases related to prior period tax positions    Decreases related to prior period tax positions  (338 )  (79 )  (288 ) Settlements  (37 )  (4 )  (477 ) Lapse of statute of limitations  (23 )  (54 )  (75 ) End of year  $ 3,041  3,080  2,465 ##TABLE_ENDThe unrecognized tax benefits of $3.0 billion at January 1, 2017 , if recognized, would affect the Companys annual effective tax rate. The Company conducts business and files tax returns in numerous countries and currently has tax audits in progress with a number of tax authorities. The IRS has completed its audit for the tax years through 2009 and is currently auditing the tax years 2010-2012. In other major jurisdictions where the Company conducts business, the years remain open generally back to the year 2004. The Company believes it is possible that audits may be completed by tax authorities in some jurisdictions over the next twelve months. However, the Company is not able to provide a reasonably reliable estimate of the timing of any other future tax payments relating to uncertain tax positions. The Company classifies liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits and related interest and penalties as long-term liabilities. Interest expense and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits are classified as income tax expense. The Company recognized after tax interest expense of $7 million , $44 million and $12 million in 2016 , 2015 and 2014 , respectively. The total amount of accrued interest was $344 million and $366 million in 2016 and 2015 , respectively.  ##TABLE_START  ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START 9.

Pensions and Other Benefit Plans ##TABLE_END The Company sponsors various retirement and pension plans, including defined benefit, defined contribution and termination indemnity plans, which cover most employees worldwide. The Company also provides post-retirement benefits, primarily health care, to all eligible U.S. retired employees and their dependents. Many international employees are covered by government-sponsored programs and the cost to the Company is not significant. Retirement plan benefits for employees hired before January 1, 2015 are primarily based on the employees compensation during the last three to five years before retirement and the number of years of service. In 2014, the Company announced that the U.S. Defined Benefit plan was amended to adopt a new benefit formula, effective for employees hired on or after January 1, 2015. The benefits are calculated using a new formula based on employee compensation over total years of service. International subsidiaries have plans under which funds are deposited with trustees, annuities are purchased under group contracts, or reserves are provided. The Company does not fund retiree health care benefits in advance and has the right to modify these plans in the future. In 2016 and 2015 the Company used December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015 , respectively, as the measurement date for all U.S. and international retirement and other benefit plans. Net periodic benefit costs for the Companys defined benefit retirement plans and other benefit plans for 2016 , 2015 and 2014 include the following components: ##TABLE_START   Retirement Plans  Other Benefit Plans (Dollars in Millions)       Service cost  $  1,037     Interest cost    1,018    Expected return on plan assets  (1,962 )  (1,809 )  (1,607 )  (6 )  (7 )  (7 ) Amortization of prior service cost (credit)     (34 )  (33 )  (34 ) Amortization of net transition obligation            Recognized actuarial losses       Curtailments and settlements    (17 )       Net periodic benefit cost  $      ##TABLE_ENDAmounts expected to be recognized in net periodic benefit cost in the coming year for the Companys defined benefit retirement plans and other post-retirement plans: ##TABLE_START (Dollars in Millions)  Amortization of net transition obligation $  Amortization of net actuarial losses Amortization of prior service credit ##TABLE_ENDUnrecognized gains and losses for the U.S. pension plans are amortized over the average remaining future service for each plan. For plans with no active employees, they are amortized over the average life expectancy. The amortization of gains and  ##TABLE_START  ##TABLE_END losses for the other U.S. benefit plans is determined by using a 10% corridor of the greater of the market value of assets or the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation. Total unamortized gains and losses in excess of the corridor are amortized over the average remaining future service. Prior service costs/benefits for the U.S. pension plans are amortized over the average remaining future service of plan participants at the time of the plan amendment. Prior service cost/benefit for the other U.S. benefit plans is amortized over the average remaining service to full eligibility age of plan participants at the time of the plan amendment. The following table represents the weighted-average actuarial assumptions: ##TABLE_START   Retirement Plans  Other Benefit Plans Worldwide Benefit Plans       Net Periodic Benefit Cost             Service cost discount rate  3.98 %  3.78  4.78  4.77  4.31  5.25 Interest cost discount rate  4.24 %  3.78  4.78  4.10  4.31  5.25 Rate of increase in compensation levels  4.02 %  4.05  4.08  4.32  4.11  4.29 Expected long-term rate of return on plan assets  8.55 %  8.53  8.46                    Benefit Obligation             Discount rate  3.78 %  4.11  3.78  4.42  4.63  4.31 Rate of increase in compensation levels  4.02 %  4.01  4.05  4.29  4.28  4.11 ##TABLE_ENDThe Companys discount rates are determined by considering current yield curves representing high quality, long-term fixed income instruments. The resulting discount rates are consistent with the duration of plan liabilities. For the fiscal year 2016, the Company changed its methodology in determining service and interest cost from the single weighted average discount rate approach to duration specific spot rates along that yield curve to the plans liability cash flows, which management has concluded is a more precise estimate. Prior to this change in methodology, the Company measured service and interest costs utilizing a single weighted-average discount rate derived from the yield curve used to measure the plan obligations. The Company has accounted for this change as a change in accounting estimate and, accordingly, has accounted for it on a prospective basis. This change does not impact the benefit obligation and did not have a material impact to the 2016 full year results. The expected rates of return on plan asset assumptions represent the Company's assessment of long-term returns on diversified investment portfolios globally. The assessment is determined using projections from external financial sources, long-term historical averages, actual returns by asset class and the various asset class allocations by market.

International Plans are funded in accordance with local regulations. Additional discretionary contributions are made when deemed appropriate to meet the long-term obligations of the plans. For certain plans, funding is not a common practice, as funding provides no economic benefit. Consequently, the Company has several pension plans that are not funded. In 2016 , the Company contributed $501 million and $337 million to its U.S. and international pension plans, respectively.

In determining investment policies, strategies and goals, each committee or board considers factors including, local pension rules and regulations; local tax regulations; availability of investment vehicles (separate accounts, commingled accounts, insurance funds, etc.); funded status of the plans; ratio of actives to retirees; duration of liabilities; and other relevant factors including: diversification, liquidity of local markets and liquidity of base currency. A majority of the Companys pension funds are open to new entrants and are expected to be on-going plans. Permitted investments are primarily liquid and/or listed, with little reliance on illiquid and non-traditional investments such as hedge funds. The Companys retirement plan asset allocation at the end of 2016 and 2015 and target allocations for 2017 are as follows: ##TABLE_START   Percent of Plan Assets  Target Allocation     Worldwide Retirement Plans       Equity securities  %  %  % Debt securities    Total plan assets  %  %  % ##TABLE_ENDDetermination of Fair Value of Plan Assets The Plan has an established and well-documented process for determining fair values. Fair value is based upon quoted market prices, where available. If listed prices or quotes are not available, fair value is based upon models that primarily use, as inputs, market-based or independently sourced market parameters, including yield curves, interest rates, volatilities, equity or debt prices, foreign exchange rates and credit curves. While the Plan believes its valuation methods are appropriate and consistent with other market participants, the use of different methodologies or assumptions to determine the fair value of certain financial instruments could result in a different estimate of fair value at the reporting date. Valuation Hierarchy The authoritative literature establishes a three-level hierarchy to prioritize the inputs used in measuring fair value. The levels within the hierarchy are described in the table below with Level 1 having the highest priority and Level 3 having the lowest. A financial instruments categorization within the valuation hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. Following is a description of the valuation methodologies used for the investments measured at fair value. ##TABLE_START  Short-term investments  Cash and quoted short-term instruments are valued at the closing price or the amount held on deposit by the custodian bank. Other investments are through investment vehicles valued using the Net Asset Value (NAV) provided by the administrator of the fund. The NAV is based on the value of the underlying assets owned by the fund, minus its liabilities, and then divided by the number of shares outstanding. The NAV is a quoted price in a market that is not active and classified as Level 2. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Government and agency securities  A limited number of these investments are valued at the closing price reported on the major market on which the individual securities are traded. Where quoted prices are available in an active market, the investments are classified within Level 1 of the valuation hierarchy. If quoted market prices are not available for the specific security, then fair values are estimated by using pricing models, quoted prices of securities with similar characteristics or discounted cash flows. When quoted market prices for a security are not available in an active market, they are classified as Level 2. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Debt instruments  A limited number of these investments are valued at the closing price reported on the major market on which the individual securities are traded. Where quoted prices are available in an active market, the investments are classified as Level 1. If quoted market prices are not available for the specific security, then fair values are estimated by using pricing models, quoted prices of securities with similar characteristics or discounted cash flows and are classified as Level 2. Level 3 debt instruments are priced based on unobservable inputs. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Equity securities  Common stocks are valued at the closing price reported on the major market on which the individual securities are traded. Substantially all common stock is classified within Level 1 of the valuation hierarchy. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Commingled funds  These investment vehicles are valued using the NAV provided by the fund administrator. The NAV is based on the value of the underlying assets owned by the fund, minus its liabilities, and then divided by the number of shares outstanding. Assets in the Level 2 category have a quoted market price. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  Insurance contracts  The instruments are issued by insurance companies. The fair value is based on negotiated value and the underlying investments held in separate account portfolios as well as considering the credit worthiness of the issuer. The underlying investments are government, asset-backed and fixed income securities. In general, insurance contracts are classified as Level 3 as there are no quoted prices nor other observable inputs for pricing. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Other assets  Other assets are represented primarily by limited partnerships and real estate investments, as well as commercial loans and commercial mortgages that are not classified as corporate debt. Other assets that are exchange listed and actively traded are classified as Level 1, while inactively traded assets are classified as Level 2. ##TABLE_END The following table sets forth the Retirement Plans' investments measured at fair value as of December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015: ##TABLE_START   Quoted Prices in Active Markets for Identical Assets  Significant Other Observable Inputs  Significant Unobservable Inputs (a)  Investments Measured at Net Asset Value (b)      (Level 1)  (Level 2)  (Level 3)     Total Assets (Dollars in Millions)         2016  Short-term investment funds  $             Government and agency securities      2,655  1,767         2,655  1,767 Debt instruments      1,237  1,050        1,237  1,051 Equity securities  11,433  11,317           11,445  11,328 Commingled funds      1,316  1,100      5,767  6,122 7,083  7,222 Insurance contracts                Other assets              392  Investments at fair value  $ 11,578  11,501  5,872  4,347    6,159  6,382 23,633  22,254 ##TABLE_END(a)  The activity for the Level 3 assets is not significant for all years presented. (b)  Per adoption of ASU 2015-07, certain investments that are measured at fair value using the net asset value per share (or its equivalent) practical expedient have not been classified in the fair value hierarchy. As per ASU 2015-7 prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation. The fair value amounts presented in this table are intended to permit reconciliation of the fair value hierarchy to the total retirement plan assets. The Company's Other Benefit Plans are unfunded except for U.S. commingled funds (Level 2) of $75 million and $74 million at December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. The fair value of Johnson  Johnson Common Stock directly held in plan assets was $847 million ( 3.6% of total plan assets) at December 31, 2016 and $751 million ( 3.4% of total plan assets) at December 31, 2015. ##TABLE_START 11.

Employee Benefit Plans - reclassifications are included in net periodic benefit cost. See Note 10 for additional details. Gain/(Loss) On Derivatives  Hedges - reclassifications to earnings are recorded in the same account as the hedged transaction. See Note 6 for additional details.  ##TABLE_START  ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START 14. International Currency Translation ##TABLE_END For translation of its subsidiaries operating in non-U.S. Dollar currencies, the Company has determined that the local currencies of its international subsidiaries are the functional currencies except those in highly inflationary economies, which are defined as those which have had compound cumulative rates of inflation of 100% or more during the past three years , or where a substantial portion of its cash flows are not in the local currency. In consolidating international subsidiaries, balance sheet currency effects are recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income. This equity account includes the results of translating certain balance sheet assets and liabilities at current exchange rates and some accounts at historical rates, except for those located in highly inflationary economies. The translation of balance sheet accounts for highly inflationary economies are reflected in the operating results. A rollforward of the changes during 2016 , 2015 and 2014 for foreign currency translation adjustments is included in Note 13. Net currency transaction gains and losses included in Other (income) expense were losses of $289 million , $104 million and $156 million in 2016 , 2015 and 2014 , respectively. ##TABLE_START 15.

Common Stock, Stock Option Plans and Stock Compensation Agreements ##TABLE_END At January 1, 2017 , the Company had 2 stock-based compensation plans. The shares outstanding are for contracts under the Company's 2005 Long-Term Incentive Plan and the 2012 Long-Term Incentive Plan. The 2005 Long-Term Incentive Plan expired April 26, 2012. All options and restricted shares granted subsequent to that date were under the 2012 Long-Term Incentive Plan. Under the 2012 Long-Term Incentive Plan, the Company may issue up to 650 million shares of common stock, plus any shares canceled, expired, forfeited, or not issued from the 2005 Long-Term Incentive Plan subsequent to April 26, 2012. Shares available for future grants under the 2012 Long-Term Incentive Plan were 439 million at the end of 2016 . The compensation cost that has been charged against income for these plans was $878 million , $874 million and $792 million for 2016 , 2015 and 2014 , respectively. The total income tax benefit recognized in the income statement for share-based compensation costs was $256 million , $253 million and $259 million for 2016 , 2015 and 2014 , respectively. An additional tax benefit of $353 million was recognized in 2016 due to the adoption of a new accounting standard for the reporting of additional  ##TABLE_START  ##TABLE_END tax benefits on share-based compensation as described in Note 1. The total unrecognized compensation cost was $749 million , $744 million and $722 million for 2016 , 2015 and 2014 , respectively. The weighted average period for this cost to be recognized was 1.09 years, 0.98 years and 1.18 years for 2016 , 2015 , and 2014 , respectively. Share-based compensation costs capitalized as part of inventory were insignificant in all periods. The Company settles employee benefit equity issuances with treasury shares. Treasury shares are replenished throughout the year for the number of shares used to settle employee benefit equity issuances. Stock Options Stock options expire 10 years from the date of grant and vest over service periods that range from 6 months to 4 years . All options are granted at the average of the high and low prices of the Companys Common Stock on the New York Stock Exchange on the date of grant. The fair value of each option award was estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option valuation model that uses the assumptions noted in the following table. For 2014 grants, expected volatility represents a blended rate of 4-year daily historical average volatility rate, and a 5-week average implied volatility rate based on at-the-money traded Johnson  Johnson options with a life of 2 years. For 2016 and 2015 grants, expected volatility represents a blended rate of 10-year weekly historical overall volatility rate, and a 5-week average implied volatility rate based on at-the-money traded Johnson  Johnson options with a life of 2 years. For all grants, historical data is used to determine the expected life of the option. The risk-free rate was based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant. The average fair value of options granted was $10.01 , $10.68 and $8.42 , in 2016 , 2015 and 2014 , respectively. The fair value was estimated based on the weighted average assumptions of: ##TABLE_START    Risk-free rate 1.51 %  1.77 %  1.87 % Expected volatility 15.76 %  15.48 %  14.60 % Expected life (in years) 7.0  7.0  6.0 Expected dividend yield 3.10 %  2.90 %  3.10 % ##TABLE_ENDA summary of option activity under the Plan as of January 1, 2017 , January 3, 2016 and December 28, 2014 , and changes during the years ending on those dates is presented below: ##TABLE_START (Shares in Thousands)  Outstanding Shares  Weighted Average Exercise Price  Aggregate Intrinsic Value (Dollars in Millions) Shares at December 29, 2013  119,556  $ 64.70  $ 3,306 Options granted  24,356  90.44   Options exercised  (25,319 )  62.31   Options canceled/forfeited  (2,881 )  75.48   Shares at December 28, 2014  115,712  70.37  4,014 Options granted  20,484  100.06   Options exercised  (16,683 )  62.53   Options canceled/forfeited  (2,996 )  82.22   Shares at January 3, 2016  116,517  76.41  3,065 Options granted  22,491  101.87   Options exercised  (22,547 )  65.66   Options canceled/forfeited  (3,006 )  92.83   Shares at January 1, 2017  113,455  $ 83.16  $ 3,636 ##TABLE_ENDThe total intrinsic value of options exercised was $980 million , $644 million and $954 million in 2016 , 2015 and 2014 , respectively.  ##TABLE_START  ##TABLE_END The following table summarizes stock options outstanding and exercisable at January 1, 2017 : ##TABLE_START (Shares in Thousands)  Outstanding  Exercisable Exercise Price Range  Options  Average Life (1)  Average Exercise Price  Options  Average Exercise Price $52.13-$58.33  7,361  2.1  $58.32  7,361  $58.32 $58.34-$62.20  11,297  2.4  $61.95  11,297  $61.95 $62.62-$65.62  14,380  3.1  $64.24  14,380  $64.24 $66.07-$72.54  18,127  6.0  $72.52  17,241  $72.52 $90.44-$101.87  62,290  8.1  $97.40   $93.73   113,455  6.2  $83.16  50,414  $65.77 ##TABLE_END(1) Average contractual life remaining in years. Stock options outstanding at January 3, 2016 and December 28, 2014 were 116,517 and an average life of 5.9 years and 115,712 and an average life of 5.7 years, respectively. Stock options exercisable at January 3, 2016 and December 28, 2014 were 48,345 at an average price of $62.26 and 57,846 at an average price of $61.94 , respectively. Restricted Share Units and Performance Share Units The Company grants restricted share units which vest over service periods that range from 6 months to 3 years . The Company also grants performance share units, which are paid in shares of Johnson  Johnson Common Stock after the end of a three -year performance period. Whether any performance share units vest, and the amount that does vest, is tied to the completion of service periods that range from 6 months to 3 years and the achievement, over a three -year period, of three equally-weighted goals that directly align with or help drive long-term total shareholder return: operational sales, adjusted operational earnings per share, and relative total shareholder return. The number of shares actually earned at the end of the three -year period will vary, based only on actual performance, from 0% to 200% of the target number of performance share units granted . A summary of the restricted share units and performance share units activity under the Plans as of January 1, 2017 is presented below: ##TABLE_START (Shares in Thousands)  Outstanding Restricted Share Units  Outstanding Performance Share Units Shares at December 29, 2013  30,617  1,535 Granted  8,487  1,113 Issued  (9,685 )  (19 ) Canceled/forfeited  (1,726 )  (98 ) Shares at December 28, 2014  27,693  2,531 Granted  7,637  Issued  (10,164 )  (285 ) Canceled/forfeited  (1,281 )  (99 ) Shares at January 3, 2016  23,885  3,078 Granted  7,173  Issued  (8,913 )  (1,437 ) Canceled/forfeited  (1,084 )  (184 ) Shares at January 1, 2017  21,061  2,415 ##TABLE_ENDThe average fair value of the restricted share units granted was $92.45 , $91.65 and $83.01 in 2016 , 2015 and 2014 , respectively, using the fair market value at the date of grant. The fair value of restricted share units was discounted for dividends, which are not paid on the restricted share units during the vesting period. The fair value of restricted share units issued was $587.7 million , $597.6 million and $541.0 million in 2016 , 2015 and 2014 , respectively. The weighted average fair value of the performance share units granted was $105.30 , $93.54 and $85.94 in 2016 , 2015 and 2014 , calculated using the weighted average fair market value for each of the three component goals at the date of grant.  ##TABLE_START  ##TABLE_END The fair values for the sales and earnings per share goals of each performance share unit were estimated on the date of grant using the fair market value of the shares at the time of the award discounted for dividends, which are not paid on the performance share units during the vesting period. The fair value for the relative total shareholder return goal of each performance share unit was estimated on the date of grant using the Monte Carlo valuation model. The fair value of performance share units issued was $127.7 million , $16.7 million and $1.4 million in 2016 , 2015 and 2014 , respectively. ##TABLE_START 18.

Business Combinations and Divestitures ##TABLE_END Certain businesses were acquired for $4,509 million in cash and $77 million of liabilities assumed during 2016. These acquisitions were accounted for using the acquisition method and, accordingly, results of operations have been included in the financial statements from their respective dates of acquisition. The 2016 acquisitions primarily included: Vogue International LLC, a privately-held company focused on the marketing, development and distribution of salon-influenced and nature inspired hair care and other personal products; NeuWave Medical, Inc., a privately-held medical device company that manufactures and markets minimally invasive soft tissue microwave ablation systems; NeoStrata Company, Inc., a global leader in dermocosmetics, and the global rights for the commercialization of RHINOCORT  allergy spray outside the United States. The excess of purchase price over the estimated fair value of tangible assets acquired amounted to $4,077 million and has been assigned to identifiable intangible assets, with any residual recorded to goodwill. The net purchase price for Vogue International LLC of $3.3 billion was primarily recorded as amortizable intangible assets for $2.3 billion and goodwill for $1.1 billion . The weighted average life for the $2.3 billion of total amortizable intangibles is approximately 22 years . The trademark asset values were determined to have definite lives ranging from 10 to 22 years, with the majority being 22 years. The goodwill is primarily attributable to synergies expected to arise from the business acquisition and is expected to be deductible for tax purposes. The assets acquired were recorded in the Consumer segment. During the fiscal third quarter of 2016, the Company announced a definitive agreement to acquire Abbott Medical Optics (AMO), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Abbott Laboratories, for $4.325 billion in cash. The acquisition will include ophthalmic products related to: cataract surgery, laser refractive surgery and consumer eye health. The transaction closed on February 27, 2017. The purchase price allocation is in progress and is expected to result in an allocation of significant value to the amortizable intangible assets with any residual recorded as goodwill. On January 26, 2017, subsequent to year end, the Company announced a definitive transaction agreement under which the company will launch an all-cash tender offer in Switzerland to acquire all of the outstanding shares of Actelion Ltd. for $280 per share, payable in U.S. dollars, for approximately $30.0 billion . As part of the transaction, immediately prior to the completion of the acquisition, Actelion will spin out its drug discovery operations and early-stage clinical development assets into a newly created Swiss biopharmaceutical company (\"RD NewCo\"). The shares of RD NewCo, which will be listed on the SIX Swiss Exchange (SIX), will be distributed to Actelion's shareholders as a stock dividend upon closing of the tender. The Company will initially hold 16% of the shares of RD NewCo and have rights to an additional 16% of RD NewCo equity through a convertible note. Actelion has established a leading franchise of differentiated, innovative products for pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) that is highly complementary to the existing portfolio of the Company. The addition of Actelions specialty in-market medicines and late-stage products is consistent with the Company's efforts to grow in attractive and complementary therapeutic areas and serve patients with serious illnesses and significant unmet medical need. The closing is subject to the demerger, antitrust clearance and other customary closing conditions. On February 15, 2017, subsequent to year end, the Company received a binding offer from Integra LifeSciences Holdings Corporation to purchase the Codman Neurosurgery business for approximately $1.0 billion . Subsequent to year end, the Company announced it is engaging in a process to evaluate potential strategic options for the Johnson  Johnson Diabetes Care Companies, specifically LifeScan, Inc., Animas Corporation, and Calibra Medical, Inc. Strategic options may include the formation of operating partnerships, joint ventures or strategic alliances, a sale of the businesses, or other alternatives either separately or together. All options will be evaluated to determine the best opportunity to drive future growth and maximize shareholder value. There can be no assurance that this process will result in any transaction or other strategic alternative of any kind therefore, there were no assets held for sale as of January 1, 2017 related to the announcement. Certain businesses were acquired for $954 million in cash and $220 million of liabilities assumed during 2015. The assumed liabilities primarily represent the fair value of the contingent consideration of $210 million . These acquisitions were accounted for using the acquisition method and, accordingly, results of operations have been included in the financial statements from their respective dates of acquisition. The 2015 acquisitions primarily included: XO1 Limited, a privately-held biopharmaceutical company developing an anti-thrombin antibody and Novira Therapeutics, Inc., a privately held clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company developing innovative therapies for curative treatment of chronic hepatitis B virus infection. The excess of purchase price over the estimated fair value of tangible assets acquired amounted to $1,173 million and has been assigned to identifiable intangible assets, with any residual recorded to goodwill. Of this amount, approximately $839 million has been identified as the value of IPRD primarily associated with the acquisitions of XO1 Limited and Novira Therapeutics, Inc. The value of the IPRD was calculated using cash flow projections discounted for the inherent risk in the projects. The IPRD related to the acquisition of XO1 Limited of $360 million is associated with a recombinant human antibody developed to mimic the activity of a human antibody which appears to produce an anticoagulated state without predisposition to bleeding. A probability of success factor of 36.0% was used to reflect inherent clinical and regulatory risk. The discount rate applied was 11.75% .  ##TABLE_START  ##TABLE_END The IPRD related to the acquisition of Novira Therapeutics, Inc. of $396 million is associated with its lead candidate NVR 3-778 which is an investigational small molecule, direct-acting antiviral, for oral administration in patients with HBV that inhibits the HBV core or capsid protein. A probability of success factor of 51.0% was used to reflect inherent clinical and regulatory risk. The discount rate applied was 16.0% . Certain businesses were acquired for $2,129 million in cash and $38 million of liabilities assumed during 2014. These acquisitions were accounted for using the acquisition method and, accordingly, results of operations have been included in the financial statements from their respective dates of acquisition. The 2014 acquisitions included: Covagen AG, a privately-held, biopharmaceutical company specializing in the development of multispecific protein therapeutics through the FynomAb  technology platform; Alios BioPharma, Inc., a privately-held, clinical stage biopharmaceutical company focused on developing therapies for viral diseases; and the ORSL TM electrolyte ready-to-drink brand from Jagdale Industries Ltd. The excess of purchase price over the estimated fair value of tangible assets acquired amounted to $2,069 million and has been assigned to identifiable intangible assets, with any residual recorded to goodwill. Of this amount, approximately $1,913 million has been identified as the value of IPRD associated with the acquisitions of Covagen AG and Alios BioPharma, Inc. The value of the IPRD was calculated using cash flow projections discounted for the inherent risk in the projects. The IPRD related to the acquisition of Alios BioPharma, Inc. of $1,688 million is associated with Alios lead compound AL-8176, an orally administered antiviral therapy for treatment of infants with respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). A probability of success factor of 60.0% was used to reflect inherent clinical and regulatory risk. The discount rate applied was 11.4% . The IPRD related to the acquisition of Covagen AG of $225 million is associated with Covagens lead compound COVA-322, currently in Phase 1b study for psoriasis and holding potential as a treatment for a broad range of inflammatory diseases including rheumatoid arthritis. A probability of success factor of 26.0% was used to reflect inherent clinical and regulatory risk. The discount rate applied was 12.5% . During 2015, the Company recorded a charge for the impairment of the IPRD related to the acquisition of Covagen AG. In 2012, the Company completed the acquisition of Synthes, Inc. for a purchase price of $20.2 billion in cash and stock. In connection with the acquisition of Synthes, Inc. the Company entered into two accelerated share repurchase (ASR) agreements. In 2013, the Company settled the remaining liabilities under the ASR agreements. While the Company believes that the transactions under each ASR agreement and a series of related internal transactions were consummated in a tax efficient manner in accordance with applicable law, it is possible that the Internal Revenue Service could assert one or more contrary positions to challenge the transactions from a tax perspective. If challenged, an amount up to the total purchase price for the Synthes shares could be treated as subject to applicable U.S. tax at approximately the statutory rate to the Company, plus interest. Supplemental pro forma information for 2016, 2015 and 2014 in accordance with U.S. GAAP standards related to business combinations, and goodwill and other intangible assets, is not provided, as the impact of the aforementioned acquisitions did not have a material effect on the Companys results of operations, cash flows or financial position. During 2016, the Company divestitures included: the controlled substance raw material and active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) business; certain anesthetic products in Europe; and certain non-strategic Consumer brands. In 2016, the pre-tax gains on the divestitures were approximately $0.6 billion . During 2015, the Company divestitures included: the Cordis business to Cardinal Health; the SPLENDA  brand to Heartland Food Products Group; and the U.S. license rights to NUCYNTA  (tapentadol), NUCYNTA  ER (tapentadol extended-release tablets), and NUCYNTA  (tapentadol) oral solution. In 2015, the pre-tax gains on the divestitures were approximately $2.6 billion . During 2014, the Company divestitures included: the Ortho-Clinical Diagnostics business to The Carlyle Group; the K-Y  brand to Reckitt Benckiser Group PLC in the U.S. and certain other markets; and the BENECOL  brand to Raisio plc. In 2014, the pre-tax gains on the divestitures were approximately $2.4 billion . The Company completed the divestiture of its Ortho-Clinical Diagnostics business to The Carlyle Group for approximately $4.0 billion and the Company recorded a pre-tax gain of approximately $1.9 billion . Ortho-Clinical Diagnostics' results are included in the Company's Medical Devices segment. ##TABLE_START 21. Legal Proceedings ##TABLE_END Johnson  Johnson and certain of its subsidiaries are involved in various lawsuits and claims regarding product liability, intellectual property, commercial and other matters; governmental investigations; and other legal proceedings that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of their business. The Company records accruals for loss contingencies associated with these legal matters when it is probable that a liability will be incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. As of January 1, 2017, the Company has determined that the liabilities associated with certain litigation matters are probable and can be reasonably estimated. The Company has accrued for these matters and will continue to monitor each related legal issue and adjust accruals as might be warranted based on new information and further developments in accordance with ASC 450-20-25. For these and other litigation and regulatory matters discussed below for which a loss is probable or reasonably possible, the Company is unable to estimate the possible loss or range of loss beyond the amounts already accrued. Amounts accrued for legal contingencies often result from a complex series  ##TABLE_START  ##TABLE_END of judgments about future events and uncertainties that rely heavily on estimates and assumptions. The ability to make such estimates and judgments can be affected by various factors, including whether damages sought in the proceedings are unsubstantiated or indeterminate; scientific and legal discovery has not commenced or is not complete; proceedings are in early stages; matters present legal uncertainties; there are significant facts in dispute; or there are numerous parties involved. In the Company's opinion, based on its examination of these matters, its experience to date and discussions with counsel, the ultimate outcome of legal proceedings, net of liabilities accrued in the Company's balance sheet, is not expected to have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial position. However, the resolution of, or increase in accruals for, one or more of these matters in any reporting period may have a material adverse effect on the Company's results of operations and cash flows for that period. PRODUCT LIABILITY Johnson  Johnson and certain of its subsidiaries are involved in numerous product liability claims and lawsuits involving multiple products. Claimants in these cases seek substantial compensatory and, where available, punitive damages. While the Company believes it has substantial defenses, it is not feasible to predict the ultimate outcome of litigation. The Company has established accruals for product liability claims and lawsuits in compliance with ASC 450-20 based on currently available information, which in some cases may be limited. The Company accrues an estimate of the legal defense costs needed to defend each matter when those costs are probable and can be reasonably estimated. For certain of these matters, the Company has accrued additional amounts such as estimated costs associated with settlements, damages and other losses. To the extent adverse verdicts have been rendered against the Company, the Company does not record an accrual until a loss is determined to be probable and can be reasonably estimated. Product liability accruals can represent projected product liability for thousands of claims around the world, each in different litigation environments and with different fact patterns. Changes to the accruals may be required in the future as additional information becomes available. The most significant of these cases include the DePuy ASR XL Acetabular System and DePuy ASR Hip Resurfacing System, the PINNACLE  Acetabular Cup System, pelvic meshes, RISPERDAL  , XARELTO  and JOHNSON'S  Baby Powder. As of January 1, 2017, in the U.S. there were approximately 2,000 plaintiffs with direct claims in pending lawsuits regarding injuries allegedly due to the DePuy ASR XL Acetabular System and DePuy ASR Hip Resurfacing System, 9,400 with respect to the PINNACLE  Acetabular Cup System, 54,800 with respect to pelvic meshes, 18,500 with respect to RISPERDAL  , 16,900 with respect to XARELTO  and 3,100 with respect to JOHNSON'S  Baby Powder. In August 2010, DePuy Orthopaedics, Inc. (DePuy) announced a worldwide voluntary recall of its ASR XL Acetabular System and DePuy ASR  Hip Resurfacing System used in hip replacement surgery. Claims for personal injury have been made against DePuy and Johnson  Johnson. The number of pending lawsuits is expected to fluctuate as certain lawsuits are settled or dismissed and additional lawsuits are filed. Cases filed in federal courts in the United States have been organized as a multi-district litigation in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Ohio. Litigation has also been filed in countries outside of the United States, primarily in the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, Ireland, Germany and Italy. In November 2013, DePuy reached an agreement with a Court-appointed committee of lawyers representing ASR Hip System plaintiffs to establish a program to settle claims with eligible ASR Hip patients in the United States who had surgery to replace their ASR Hips, known as revision surgery, as of August 31, 2013. This settlement covered approximately 8,000 patients. In February 2015, DePuy reached an additional agreement, which effectively extends the existing settlement program to ASR Hip patients who had revision surgeries after August 31, 2013 and prior to February 1, 2015. This second agreement is estimated to cover approximately 1,800 additional patients. The estimated cost of these agreements is covered by existing accruals. This settlement program is expected to bring to a close significant ASR Hip litigation activity in the United States. However, many lawsuits in the United States will remain, and the settlement program does not address litigation outside of the United States. In Australia, a settlement was reached with representatives of a class action lawsuit pending in the Federal Court of New South Wales that resolves the claims of the majority of ASR Hip patients in that country. The Company continues to receive information with respect to potential costs associated with this recall on a worldwide basis. The Company has established accruals for the costs associated with the DePuy ASR Hip program and related product liability litigation. Changes to these accruals may be required in the future as additional information becomes available. Claims for personal injury have also been made against DePuy and Johnson  Johnson relating to the PINNACLE  Acetabular Cup System used in hip replacement surgery. The number of pending product liability lawsuits continues to increase, and the Company continues to receive information with respect to potential costs and the anticipated number of cases. Cases filed in federal courts in the United States have been organized as a multi-district litigation in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Texas. Litigation has also been filed in countries outside of the United States, primarily in the United Kingdom. The Company has established an accrual for defense costs in connection with product liability litigation associated  ##TABLE_START  ##TABLE_END with the PINNACLE  Acetabular Cup System. Changes to this accrual may be required in the future as additional information becomes available. Claims for personal injury have been made against Ethicon, Inc. (Ethicon) and Johnson  Johnson arising out of Ethicon's pelvic mesh devices used to treat stress urinary incontinence and pelvic organ prolapse. The number of pending product liability lawsuits continues to increase, and the Company continues to receive information with respect to potential costs and the anticipated number of cases. Cases filed in federal courts in the United States have been organized as a multi-district litigation in the United States District Court for the Southern District of West Virginia. In addition, class actions and individual personal injury cases or claims have been commenced in various countries outside of the United States, including claims and cases in the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, Belgium, Italy and Venezuela, and class actions in Israel, Australia and Canada, seeking damages for alleged injury resulting from Ethicon's pelvic mesh devices. The Company has established an accrual with respect to product liability litigation associated with Ethicon's pelvic mesh products. Changes to this accrual may be required in the future as additional information becomes available. Claims for personal injury have been made against Janssen Pharmaceuticals, Inc. and Johnson  Johnson arising out of the use of RISPERDAL  , indicated for the treatment of schizophrenia, acute manic or mixed episodes associated with bipolar I disorder and irritability associated with autism, and related compounds. Lawsuits have been primarily filed in state courts in Pennsylvania, California, and Missouri. Other actions are pending in various courts in the United States and Canada. The number of pending product liability lawsuits continues to increase, and the Company continues to receive information with respect to potential costs and the anticipated number of cases. The Company has established an accrual with respect to product liability litigation associated with RISPERDAL  . Changes to this accrual may be required in the future as additional information becomes available. Claims for personal injury have been made against Janssen Pharmaceuticals, Inc. and Johnson  Johnson arising out of the use of XARELTO  , an oral anticoagulant. The number of pending product liability lawsuits continues to increase, and the Company continues to receive information with respect to potential costs and the anticipated number of cases. Cases filed in federal courts in the United States have been organized as a multi-district litigation in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Louisiana. In addition, cases have been filed in state courts across the United States. Many of these cases have been consolidated into a state mass tort litigation in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania; and there are coordinated proceedings in Delaware, California and Missouri. Class action lawsuits also have been filed in Canada. The Company has established an accrual for defense costs in connection with product liability litigation associated with XARELTO  . Changes to this accrual may be required in the future as additional information becomes available. Claims for personal injury have been made against Johnson  Johnson Consumer Inc. and Johnson  Johnson arising out of the use of JOHNSON'S  Baby Powder. The number of pending product liability lawsuits continues to increase, and the Company continues to receive information with respect to potential costs and the anticipated number of cases. Lawsuits have been primarily filed in state courts in Missouri, New Jersey and California. In addition, a federal multi-district litigation proceeding has been created for this litigation in the District Court of New Jersey. The Company has established an accrual for defense costs in connection with product liability litigation associated with JOHNSON'S  Baby Powder. Changes to this accrual may be required in the future as additional information becomes available. INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY Certain subsidiaries of Johnson  Johnson are subject, from time to time, to legal proceedings and claims related to patent, trademark and other intellectual property matters arising out of their businesses. Many of these matters involve challenges to the coverage and/or validity of the patents on various products and allegations that certain of the Companys products infringe the patents of third parties. Although these subsidiaries believe that they have substantial defenses to these challenges and allegations with respect to all significant patents, there can be no assurance as to the outcome of these matters. A loss in any of these cases could adversely affect the ability of these subsidiaries to sell their products, result in loss of sales due to loss of market exclusivity, require the payment of past damages and future royalties, and may result in a non-cash impairment charge for any associated intangible asset. The most significant of these matters are described below. Medical Devices In June 2009, Rembrandt Vision Technologies, L.P. (Rembrandt) filed a patent infringement lawsuit against Johnson  Johnson Vision Care, Inc. (JJVCI) in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Texas alleging that JJVCI's manufacture and sale of its ACUVUE  ADVANCE and ACUVUE OASYS  Hydrogel Contact Lenses infringe their U.S. Patent No. 5,712,327 (the '327 patent). Rembrandt is seeking monetary relief. The case was transferred to the United States District Court for the Middle District of Florida. In May 2012, the jury returned a verdict holding that neither of the accused lenses infringes  ##TABLE_START  ##TABLE_END the '327 patent. Rembrandt appealed, and in August 2013, the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit affirmed the District Court's judgment. Rembrandt asked the District Court to grant it a new trial based on alleged new evidence, and in July 2014, the District Court denied Rembrandts motion. Rembrandt appealed and the Court of Appeals overturned that ruling in April 2016 and remanded the case to the District Court for a new trial. JJVCI's motion to reconsider and petition for review with the United States Supreme Court were both denied. A new trial is scheduled for August 2017. In December 2009, the State of Israel filed a lawsuit in the District Court in Tel Aviv Jaffa against Omrix Biopharmaceuticals, Inc. and various affiliates (Omrix). In the lawsuit, the State claimed that an employee of a government-owned hospital was the inventor on several patents related to fibrin glue technology that the employee developed while he was a government employee. The State claimed that he had no right to transfer any intellectual property to Omrix because it belongs to the State. The State sought damages plus royalties on QUIXIL and EVICEL  products, or alternatively, transfer of the patents to the State. The case was settled in December 2016. LifeScan filed a patent infringement lawsuit against UniStrip Technologies, LLC (UniStrip) in the United States District Court for the District of North Carolina in May 2014, alleging that the making and marketing of UniStrips strips for use in LifeScans blood glucose monitors infringe U.S. Patent Nos. 6,241,862 (the '862 patent) and 7,250,105 (the '105 patent). In August 2014, the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) determined that the '105 patent is invalid. In January 2016, the invalidity decision was upheld on appeal. LifeScan filed a motion for rehearing, which was denied. In July 2014, UniStrip brought a lawsuit against LifeScan in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, alleging antitrust violations relating to marketing practices for LifeScan strips. In March 2013, Medinol Ltd. (Medinol) filed a patent infringement lawsuit against Cordis Corporation (Cordis) and Johnson  Johnson in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York alleging that all of Cordis's sales of the CYPHER  and CYPHER SELECT  Stents made in the United States since 2005 willfully infringed four of Medinol's patents directed to the geometry of articulated stents. Medinol is seeking damages and attorneys' fees. After trial in January 2014, the District Court dismissed the case, finding Medinol unreasonably delayed bringing its claims, and Medinol did not appeal the decision. In September 2014, the District Court denied a motion by Medinol to vacate the judgment and grant it a new trial. Medinol's appeal of this decision has been dismissed. Medinol has filed a petition for review with the United States Supreme Court. Cordis was divested in 2015 and the Company retained any liability that may result from this case. In November 2016, MedIdea, L.L.C. (MedIdea) filed a patent infringement lawsuit against DePuy Orthopaedics, Inc. in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois alleging infringement by the ATTUNE  Knee System of two patents relating to posterior stabilized knee systems. Specifically, MedIdea alleges that the SOFCAM TM Contact feature of the ATTUNE  posterior stabilized knee products infringes the patents-in-suit. MedIdea is seeking monetary damages and injunctive relief. In December 2016, Ethicon Endo-Surgery, Inc. and Ethicon Endo-Surgery, LLC (now known as Ethicon LLC) sued Covidien, Inc. in the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts seeking a declaration that Covidiens U.S. Patent Nos. 6,585,735; 7,118,587; 7,473,253; 8,070,748; and 8,241,284 are either invalid or not infringed by Ethicons ENSEAL  X1 Large Jaw Tissue Sealer product (ENSEAL X1). The ENSEAL X1 product is scheduled to launch in the United States and Europe in the first quarter of 2017. Pharmaceutical In April 2016, MorphoSys AG, a German biotech company, filed a patent infringement lawsuit against Janssen Biotech, Inc. (JBI), Genmab U.S. Inc. and Genmab A/S (collectively, Genmab) in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware, alleging that JBIs manufacture and sale of DARZALEX  (daratumumab) willfully infringes MorphoSys' U.S. Patent No. 8,263,746. MorphoSys is seeking money damages. JBI licenses patents and the commercial rights to DARZALEX  from Genmab. In June 2016, JBI filed a motion to dismiss the lawsuit. In November 2016, MorphoSys sought leave to add another patent to the case (U.S. Patent No. 9,200,061), and in February 2017, the Court granted the request. Trial in the case is currently scheduled to commence in August 2018. In August 2016, Sandoz Ltd and Hexal AG (collectively, Sandoz) filed a lawsuit in the English High Court against G.D. Searle LLC (a Pfizer company) and Janssen Sciences Ireland UC (JSI) alleging that Searles supplementary protection certificate SPC/GB07/038 (SPC), which is exclusively licensed to JSI, is invalid and should be revoked. Janssen-Cilag Limited sells PREZISTA  (darunavir) in the UK pursuant to this license. In October 2016, Searle and JSI counterclaimed against Sandoz for threatened infringement of the SPC based on statements of its plans to launch generic darunavir in the UK. Trial of the case has been scheduled to begin in late April/early May 2017.  ##TABLE_START  ##TABLE_END REMICADE  Related Cases U.S. Proceedings In September 2013, Janssen Biotech, Inc. (JBI) and NYU Langone Medical Center (NYU) received an Office Action from the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) rejecting the claims in U.S. Patent No. 6,284,471 relating to REMICADE  (infliximab) (the '471 patent) in a reexamination proceeding instituted by a third party. The '471 patent is co-owned by JBI and NYU, and NYU granted JBI an exclusive license to NYUs rights under the patent. The '471 patent expires in September 2018. Following several office actions by the patent examiner, including two further rejections, and responses by JBI, the USPTO issued a further action maintaining its rejection of the '471 patent. JBI filed a notice of appeal to the USPTO's Patent Trial and Appeal Board. In November 2016, the Patent Trial and Appeal Board issued a decision upholding the examiner's rejection. JBI has filed an appeal to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. In August 2014, Celltrion Healthcare Co. Ltd. and Celltrion Inc. (together, Celltrion) filed an application with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for approval to make and sell its own infliximab biosimilar. In March 2015, JBI filed a lawsuit in the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts against Celltrion and Hospira Healthcare Corporation (Hospira), which has exclusive U.S. marketing rights for Celltrion's infliximab biosimilar, seeking, among other things, a declaratory judgment that their biosimilar product infringes or potentially infringes several JBI patents, including the '471 patent and U.S. Patent No. 7,598,083 (the '083 patent). In August 2016, the District Court granted both Celltrion's and Hospira's motions for summary judgment of invalidity of the '471 patent. JBI has appealed those decisions to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. This case and the appeal of the reexamination of the '471 patent have been designated companion cases and will be heard by the same panel of judges in the Federal Circuit. In June 2016, JBI filed two additional patent infringement lawsuits asserting the '083 patent, one against Celltrion in the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts and the other against HyClone Laboratories, Inc., the manufacturer of the cell culture media that Celltrion uses to make its biosimilar product, in the United States District Court for the District of Utah. Although the '083 patent is already asserted in the existing lawsuit against Celltrion, the additional lawsuit expands the claims to include any use of the cell culture media made in the United States to manufacture Celltrion's biosimilar. This additional lawsuit against Celltrion has been consolidated with the existing lawsuit discussed above. Hospira has moved to dismiss all counts of the lawsuit related to the '083 patent as to it. Celltrion has moved to dismiss all counts of the lawsuit related to the '083 patent without prejudice for failure to join all the co-owners of the 083 patent as plaintiffs. The trial has been postponed pending resolution of these motions. The FDA approved Celltrions infliximab biosimilar for sale in the United States in April 2016, and the 180-day period for notice of launch of a biosimilar product under the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act has passed. Hospira's parent company, Pfizer Inc., began shipment of Celltrion's infliximab biosimilar to wholesalers in the United States in late November 2016. Introduction to the U.S. market of the biosimilar will result in a reduction in U.S. sales of REMICADE  . Canadian Proceedings In March 2013, Hospira filed an impeachment proceeding against The Kennedy Institute of Rheumatology (Kennedy) challenging the validity of a Canadian patent related to REMICADE  (a Feldman patent), which is exclusively licensed to JBI. In October 2013, Kennedy, along with JBI, Janssen Inc. (Janssen) and Cilag GmbH International (both affiliates of JBI), filed a counterclaim for infringement against Celltrion and Hospira. The counterclaim alleges that the products described in Celltrions and Hospiras marketing applications to Health Canada for their subsequent entry biologics (SEB) to REMICADE  would infringe the Feldman patents owned by Kennedy. A trial in this patent action concluded in October 2016, and closing arguments took place in January 2017. The parties are awaiting a decision. In January 2014, Health Canada approved Celltrions SEB to REMICADE  , allowing Celltrion to market its infliximab biosimilar in Canada, regardless of the pending patent action. In June 2014, Health Canada approved Hospiras SEB to REMICADE  . In July 2014, Janssen filed a lawsuit to compel the Canadian Minister of Health to withdraw the Notice of Compliance for Hospiras SEB because Hospira did not serve a Notice of Allegation on Janssen to address the patent listed by Janssen on the Patent Register. In March 2015, the parties entered into a settlement agreement whereby Health Canada agreed to a Consent Judgment setting aside Hospiras Notice of Compliance, subject to Health Canada's appeal, which was filed in June 2015. Nevertheless, Hospira began marketing an infliximab biosimilar as a distributor under Celltrion's Notice of Compliance. In October 2016, the appeals court reversed the Consent Judgment. Janssen has filed an application for leave to appeal with the Supreme Court of Canada. Hospira continues to market and sell Celltrion's infliximab biosimilar in Canada.  ##TABLE_START  ##TABLE_END In Canada, if the REMICADE  patent discussed above is found to be invalid following all appeals, it could not be relied upon to prevent the further introduction of infliximab biosimilars prior to the August 1, 2017 expiry date of the patent. Litigation Against Filers of Abbreviated New Drug Applications (ANDAs) The following summarizes lawsuits pending against generic companies that have filed Abbreviated New Drug Applications (ANDAs) with the FDA, or undertaken similar regulatory processes outside of the United States, seeking to market generic forms of products sold by various subsidiaries of Johnson  Johnson prior to expiration of the applicable patents covering those products. These ANDAs typically include allegations of non-infringement, invalidity and unenforceability of the applicable patents. In the event the subsidiaries are not successful in these actions, or the statutory 30-month stays of the ANDAs expire before the United States District Court rulings are obtained, the third-party companies involved will have the ability, upon approval of the FDA, to introduce generic versions of the products at issue to the market, resulting in the potential for substantial market share and revenue losses for those products, and which may result in a non-cash impairment charge in any associated intangible asset. In addition, from time to time, subsidiaries may settle these actions and such settlements can involve the introduction of generic versions of the products at issue to the market prior to the expiration of the relevant patents. The inter partes review (IPR) process with the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO), created under the 2011 America Invents Act, is also being used by generic companies in conjunction with these ANDAs and lawsuits to challenge patents held by the Companys subsidiaries. CONCERTA   In December 2014, Janssen Inc. and ALZA Corporation filed a Notice of Application against Actavis Pharma Company (Actavis) in response to Actavis Notice of Allegation seeking approval to market a generic version of CONCERTA  before the expiration of Canadian Patent No. 2,264,852 (the '852 patent). In December 2016, the Canadian Federal Court allowed the Application and issued an order preventing Actavis from obtaining marketing approval (a Notice of Compliance) for its generic version of CONCERTA  until the expiration of the '852 patent. Actavis did not commence an appeal prior to the deadline for doing so and thus, is prevented from obtaining a Notice of Compliance for a generic version of CONCERTA  until the expiration of the '852 patent. In October 2016, ALZA Corporation and Janssen Pharmaceuticals, Inc. filed a patent infringement lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware against Amneal Pharmaceuticals of New York, LLC and Amneal Pharmaceuticals LLC in response to Amneals ANDA seeking approval to market a generic version of CONCERTA  before the expiration of United States Patent Nos. 8,163,798 and 9,144,549. In November 2016, Amneal filed a motion for judgment on the pleadings, arguing that certain claims of the patents are invalid and others are not infringed. Janssen has opposed the motion. ZYTIGA   In June and July 2015, Janssen Biotech, Inc. (JBI) received notices of paragraph IV certification from several companies advising of their respective ANDAs seeking approval for a generic version of ZYTIGA  before the expiration of one or more patents relating to ZYTIGA  . In July 2015, JBI, Janssen Oncology, Inc. (Janssen Oncology) and Janssen Research  Development, LLC (collectively, Janssen) and BTG International Ltd. (BTG) filed a patent infringement lawsuit in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey against several generic ANDA applicants (and certain of their affiliates and/or suppliers) in response to their respective ANDAs seeking approval to market a generic version of ZYTIGA  before the expiration of United States Patent Nos. 5,604,213 (the '213 patent) and/or 8,822,438 (the '438 patent). The generic companies include Actavis Laboratories, FL, Inc. (Actavis); Amneal Pharmaceuticals, LLC and Amneal Pharmaceuticals of New York, LLC (collectively, Amneal); Apotex Inc. and Apotex Corp. (collectively, Apotex); Citron Pharma LLC (Citron); Dr. Reddys Laboratories, Ltd. and Dr. Reddys Laboratories, Inc. (collectively, Dr. Reddy's); Mylan Pharmaceuticals Inc. and Mylan Inc. (collectively, Mylan); Par Pharmaceuticals, Inc. and Par Pharmaceutical Companies, Inc. (collectively, Par); Sun Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd. and Sun Pharmaceuticals Industries, Inc. (collectively, Sun); Teva Pharmaceuticals USA, Inc. (Teva); Wockhardt Bio A.G.; Wockhardt USA LLC and Wockhardt Ltd. (collectively, Wockhardt); West-Ward Pharmaceutical Corp. (West-Ward); and Hikma Pharmaceuticals, LLC (Hikma). The Court entered a stay of the lawsuit against Par and Citron, as each agreed to be bound by the decision against the other defendants in the action. The '213 patent expired in December 2016 and thus the infringement actions concern only the '438 patent. In February 2016, the Court set a trial date of October 2017. In August 2015, Janssen and BTG filed an additional jurisdictional protective lawsuit against the Mylan defendants in the United States District Court for the Northern District of West Virginia, which has been stayed.  ##TABLE_START  ##TABLE_END In August 2015, Janssen received a notice of paragraph IV certification from Hetero USA Inc., the U.S. Regulatory Agent for Hetero Labs Limited Unit-V, a division of Hetero Labs Limited (collectively, Hetero) advising of Heteros ANDA seeking approval for a generic version of ZYTIGA  before expiration of the '438 patent. In September 2015, Janssen and BTG filed an amended complaint in the New Jersey lawsuit to add alleged infringement of the '438 patent by Hetero. In March 2016, Janssen filed a motion in the New Jersey lawsuit to correct inventorship of the '438 patent to add an inventor and, if granted, for leave to amend the complaint accordingly. In January 2017, the Court granted Janssen's motion, and Janssen filed a second amended complaint adding BTG as a co-owner of the '438 patent and a co-plaintiff regarding the '438 patent infringement claims. In March 2016, Janssen received a notice from Amerigen Pharmaceuticals Limited (Amerigen) advising of Amerigens ANDA seeking approval for a generic version of ZYTIGA  before expiration of the '438 patent. In response, Janssen and BTG filed a separate patent infringement lawsuit in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey against Amerigen in May 2016. In May 2016, Janssen received a notice of paragraph IV certification from Glenmark Pharmaceuticals Inc., on behalf of Glenmark Pharmaceuticals SA, a wholly owned subsidiary of Glenmark Pharmaceuticals Ltd. (collectively, Glenmark) advising of Glenmarks ANDA seeking approval for a generic version of ZYTIGA  before expiration of the '438 patent. In response, in June 2016, Janssen and BTG filed a patent infringement lawsuit in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey against Glenmark. The parties have stipulated to a dismissal of Glenmark Pharmaceuticals Ltd. The filing of the above-referenced lawsuits triggered a stay until October 2018 during which time the FDA will not grant final approval of the generics' ANDAs unless there is an earlier District Court decision finding the patents-in-suit invalid or not infringed. In each of the above lawsuits, Janssen is seeking an order enjoining the defendants from marketing their generic versions of ZYTIGA  before the expiration of the relevant patents. In December 2015, Amerigen filed a petition for an inter partes review in the USPTO seeking to invalidate the '438 patent. In May 2016, the USPTO granted the inter partes review, and a decision as to the validity of the 438 patent is expected by May 2017. In June 2016, Argentum Pharmaceuticals LLC and Mylan Pharmaceuticals Inc. filed petitions for inter partes review in the USPTO seeking to invalidate the '438 patent and moved to join the inter partes review filed by Amerigen. The USPTO instituted Argentum's petition and granted Argentum's motion for joinder and, in January 2017, granted Mylan's petition for inter partes review but denied Mylan's motion for joinder. In August 2016, Wockhardt Bio AG filed a petition for inter partes review in the USPTO seeking to invalidate the '438 patent, which the USPTO granted in January 2017. In February 2017, Actavis, Amneal, Dr. Reddy's, Sun, Teva, West-Ward and Hikma filed a joint petition for inter partes review in the USPTO seeking to invalidate the '438 patent and moved to join the inter partes review filed by Mylan. COMPLERA   In August and September 2015, Janssen Pharmaceutica NV and Janssen Sciences Ireland UC (collectively, Janssen) and Gilead Sciences, Inc. and Gilead Sciences Ireland UC (collectively, Gilead) filed patent infringement lawsuits in the United States District Courts for the District of Delaware and the District of West Virginia, respectively, against Mylan, Inc. and Mylan Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (collectively, Mylan) in response to Mylans ANDA seeking approval to market a generic version of COMPLERA  before the expiration of United States Patent Nos. 8,841,310 (the '310 patent), 7,125,879 (the '879 patent) and 8,101,629 (the '629 patent). In the West Virginia action, in September 2015, Mylan filed an answer and counterclaims asserting invalidity and non-infringement of the '310 patent, '879 patent, and '629 patent, as well as United States Patent No. 8,080,551 (the 551 patent). In March 2016, the District of West Virginia Court stayed the lawsuit and scheduled a conditional trial date in February 2018, in accordance with the schedule in the first-filed Delaware lawsuit described below. In the Delaware action, in January and March 2016, Janssen and Gilead amended their complaint to add claims for patent infringement with respect to the 551 patent and United States Patent Nos. 7,399,856 (the '856 patent), 7,563,922 (the '922 patent), 8,101,752 (the '752 patent) and 8,618,291 (the '291 patent). Mylan filed a motion to dismiss the suit for lack of personal jurisdiction and a motion to dismiss, strike or sever the infringement claims regarding the 752 and 291 patents. In September 2016, the Delaware District Court denied both of Mylans motions. A trial in the Delaware action has been scheduled for February 2018.  ##TABLE_START  ##TABLE_END In each of these lawsuits, Janssen is seeking an order enjoining the defendants from marketing their generic versions of COMPLERA  before the expiration of the relevant patents. XARELTO   A number of generic companies have filed ANDAs seeking approval to market generic versions of XARELTO  . In October 2015, Janssen Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (JPI) and Bayer Pharma AG and Bayer Intellectual Property GmbH (collectively, Bayer) filed patent infringement lawsuits in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware against Aurobindo Pharma Limited, Aurobindo Pharma USA, Inc., Breckenridge Pharmaceutical, Inc., Micro Labs USA Inc. and Micro Labs Ltd. (collectively, Micro), Mylan Pharmaceuticals Inc., Mylan Inc. (Mylan), Prinston Pharmaceutical, Inc., Sigmapharm Laboratories, LLC, Torrent Pharmaceuticals, Limited and Torrent Pharma Inc., in response to those parties respective ANDAs seeking approval to market generic versions of XARELTO  before the expiration of Bayers United States Patent Nos. 7,157,456 (the 456 patent), 7,585,860 (the 860 patent) and 7,592,339 (the 339 patent) relating to XARELTO  . JPI is the exclusive licensee of the asserted patents. In November 2015, Mylan moved to dismiss the action. In December 2015, JPI, Bayer, and Mylan stipulated and agreed to dismiss the claims against Mylan, and suspend further briefing and argument on Mylan's motion to dismiss, pending appeals relating to personal jurisdiction over Mylan Pharmaceuticals Inc. in the District of Delaware. In February 2016, a similar patent infringement action by JPI and Bayer against Invagen Pharmaceuticals Inc. (Invagen), in response to Invagens notice of paragraph IV certification advising of its ANDA seeking FDA approval for a generic XARELTO  product before expiration of the relevant patents, was consolidated with the original case. The District Court has set a trial date of March 2018. In April 2016, JPI and Bayer filed a separate patent infringement action in the District of Delaware against Micro, in response to their notice of paragraph IV certification advising of their ANDA seeking FDA approval for a generic XARELTO  product before expiration of the 860 and 339 patents. In May 2016, this action was consolidated with the original action. In July 2016, JPI and Bayer filed a separate patent infringement action in the District of Delaware against Breckenridge Pharmaceutical, Inc., in response to its notice of paragraph IV certification advising of its ANDA seeking FDA approval for a generic XARELTO  product before expiration of the 456 and 339 patents. This action has been consolidated with the original action. In each of these lawsuits, JPI is seeking an order enjoining the defendants from marketing their generic versions of XARELTO  before the expiration of the relevant patents. In October 2016, Mylan filed petitions for inter partes review in the USPTO seeking to invalidate the 339, 456 and 860 patents. GOVERNMENT PROCEEDINGS Like other companies in the pharmaceutical and medical devices industries, Johnson  Johnson and certain of its subsidiaries are subject to extensive regulation by national, state and local government agencies in the United States and other countries in which they operate. As a result, interaction with government agencies is ongoing. The most significant litigation brought by, and investigations conducted by, government agencies are listed below. It is possible that criminal charges and substantial fines and/or civil penalties or damages could result from government investigations or litigation. Average Wholesale Price (AWP) Litigation Johnson  Johnson and several of its pharmaceutical subsidiaries (the JJ AWP Defendants), along with numerous other pharmaceutical companies, are defendants in a series of lawsuits in state and federal courts involving allegations that the pricing and marketing of certain pharmaceutical products amounted to fraudulent and otherwise actionable conduct because, among other things, the companies allegedly reported an inflated Average Wholesale Price (AWP) for the drugs at issue. Payors alleged that they used those AWPs in calculating provider reimbursement levels. Many of these cases, both federal actions and state actions removed to federal court, were consolidated for pre-trial purposes in a Multi-District Litigation (MDL) in the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts. The plaintiffs in these cases included three classes of private persons or entities that paid for any portion of the purchase of the drugs at issue based on AWP, and state government entities that made Medicaid payments for the drugs at issue based on AWP. In June 2007, after a trial on the merits, the MDL Court dismissed the claims of two of the plaintiff classes against the JJ AWP Defendants. In March 2011, the Court dismissed the claims of the third class against the JJ AWP Defendants without prejudice.  ##TABLE_START  ##TABLE_END AWP cases brought by various Attorneys General have proceeded to trial against other manufacturers. Several state cases against certain Johnson  Johnson subsidiaries have been settled, including the case in Wisconsin, which settled in February 2016. Cases are still pending in Illinois, New Jersey, and Utah. The cases in Illinois and New Jersey have not yet proceeded to trial. In Utah, the claims brought by the Attorney General were dismissed by the Court in 2013, but the State may appeal the dismissal after the conclusion of similar pending matters against other defendants. In the AWP case against the JJ AWP Defendants brought by the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, following a trial in 2010, the Pennsylvania Commonwealth Court found in favor of the Commonwealth with regard to certain of its claims under the Pennsylvania Unfair Trade Practices and Consumer Protection Law, and in favor of the JJ AWP Defendants on the Commonwealths remaining claims. Following an appeal to the Pennsylvania Supreme Court that vacated that judgment, the Commonwealth Court entered a subsequent judgment in favor of the JJ AWP Defendants on all claims. That subsequent judgment has been upheld by the Pennsylvania Supreme Court in a successive appeal. McNeil Consumer Healthcare Starting in June 2010, McNeil Consumer Healthcare Division of McNEIL-PPC, Inc. (now Johnson  Johnson Consumer Inc., McNeil Consumer Healthcare Division) (McNeil Consumer Healthcare) and certain affiliates, including Johnson  Johnson (the Companies), received grand jury subpoenas from the United States Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania requesting documents broadly relating to recalls of various products of McNeil Consumer Healthcare, and the FDA inspections of the Fort Washington, Pennsylvania and Lancaster, Pennsylvania manufacturing facilities, as well as certain documents relating to recalls of a small number of products of other subsidiaries. In addition, in February 2011, the government served McNEIL-PPC, Inc. (now Johnson  Johnson Consumer Inc.) (JJCI) with a Civil Investigative Demand seeking records relevant to its investigation to determine if there was a violation of the Federal False Claims Act. In March 2015, McNEIL-PPC, Inc. (now JJCI) entered a guilty plea in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania to a misdemeanor violation of the U.S. Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act. McNEIL-PPC, Inc. (now JJCI) agreed to pay a $20 million fine and a $5 million forfeiture to resolve the matter. The Companies have also received Civil Investigative Demands from multiple State Attorneys General Offices broadly relating to the McNeil recall issues. The Companies continue to cooperate with these inquiries, which are being coordinated through a multi-state coalition. If a resolution cannot be reached with this multi-state coalition, it is possible that individual State Attorneys General Offices may file civil monetary claims against the Companies. In January 2011, the Oregon Attorney General filed a civil complaint against Johnson  Johnson, McNEIL-PPC, Inc. (now JJCI) and McNeil Healthcare LLC in state court alleging civil violations of the Oregon Unlawful Trade Practices Act relating to an earlier recall of a McNeil OTC product. In November 2012, the state court granted a motion by the Companies to dismiss Oregon's complaint in its entirety, with prejudice. In November 2015, the State Court of Appeals reversed the trial court and reinstated Oregon's consumer protection claims. In February 2016, the Oregon Supreme Court denied the Companies' petition for review, and the case was sent back to the trial court. Opioids Litigation As described below, Johnson  Johnson (JJ) and Janssen Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (JPI), along with other pharmaceutical companies, have been named in four lawsuits alleging claims related to marketing of opioids, including DURAGESIC  , NUCYNTA  and NUCYNTA  ER, and have been subpoenaed by two other states for information related to opioid marketing practices. In May 2014, Santa Clara and Orange Counties in California filed a complaint in state court in Orange County, California against numerous pharmaceutical manufacturers, including JJ and JPI, alleging claims related to opioid marketing practices, including false advertising, unfair competition, and public nuisance. The counties seek injunctive and monetary relief. In February 2015, the defendants filed motions challenging the sufficiency of the complaint. In August 2015, the Court stayed the case until the FDA concludes its ongoing inquiry into the safety and effectiveness of long-term opioid treatment. Following a motion by the counties to lift the stay, in October 2016, the Court kept the stay in place in part, requested the parties to confer, and adjourned the matter until a later date. In June 2014, the City of Chicago filed a complaint in Cook County Circuit Court against the same group of pharmaceutical manufacturers, including JJ and JPI, alleging a number of claims related to opioid marketing practices, including consumer fraud violations and false claims, and seeking injunctive and monetary relief. The case was later removed to the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois. In December 2014, JJ and JPI filed a motion to dismiss the City of Chicago's first amended complaint, which was granted with leave to file an amended complaint. The City filed a second  ##TABLE_START  ##TABLE_END amended complaint, and in November 2015, JJ and JPI filed a motion to dismiss the second amended complaint. In September 2016, the Court dismissed eight of the Citys ten causes of action and granted the City one final opportunity to replead the dismissed claims. The City filed a third amended complaint in October 2016, and, in December 2016, JJ and JPI filed an answer as to two causes of action and a motion to dismiss the remaining causes of action. In September 2014, the Tennessee Attorney General Division of Consumer Affairs issued a Request for Information to JPI and other pharmaceutical companies related to opioids marketing practices. In August 2015, the New Hampshire Attorney General, Consumer Protection and Antitrust Bureau issued a subpoena to JPI and other pharmaceutical companies related to opioids marketing practices. In October 2015, the State filed a motion in the State of New Hampshire Superior Court to enforce the subpoena. JPI and the other pharmaceutical companies subsequently filed a joint motion for injunctive relief and a protective order to preclude the State from engaging private contingent fee counsel to participate in the States investigation or any subsequent enforcement action. In March 2016, the Court granted the protective order on the grounds that the State had not obtained requisite executive and legislative approvals to retain private counsel, but rejected the contention that the contingency fee agreement was otherwise unlawful. All parties have appealed the March 2016 ruling to the New Hampshire Supreme Court. In August 2016, the Court denied the pharmaceutical companies joint motion to enforce the protective order on the ground that the underlying deficiency (legislative approval) had been cured. In September 2016, the State stipulated to stay enforcement of any subpoenas pending the New Hampshire Supreme Courts consideration of the companies appeal of the March 2016 ruling. In December 2015, the State of Mississippi filed a complaint in the Chancery Court of the First Judicial District of Hinds County against substantially the same group of pharmaceutical manufacturers as in the suits brought by the California counties and City of Chicago, including JJ and JPI, alleging a number of claims related to opioid marketing practices and seeking penalties and injunctive and monetary relief. In March 2016, defendants filed a motion to transfer venue and motions to dismiss the complaint. In August 2016, the County of Suffolk in New York filed a complaint against several pharmaceutical manufacturers in New York Supreme Court, including JJ and JPI, alleging claims related to opioid marketing, including claims based on deceptive acts and practices, false advertising, fraud and unjust enrichment. The complaint seeks penalties and injunctive and monetary relief. In February 2017, the County of Erie and the County of Broome in New York each filed a complaint in New York Supreme Court against several pharmaceutical manufacturers, including JPI. Both complaints allege claims related to opioid marketing practices, including statutory claims for deceptive acts and practices, false advertising, and violation of New Yorks Social Services Law, and common law causes of action for public nuisance, fraud, and unjust enrichment. Each county is seeking compensatory and punitive damages and costs. Other In September 2011, Synthes, Inc. (Synthes) received a Civil Investigative Demand issued pursuant to the False Claims Act from the United States Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania. The demand sought information regarding allegations that fellowships had been offered to hospitals in exchange for agreements to purchase products. Synthes has produced documents and information in response to the demand and is cooperating with the inquiry. In May 2012, Acclarent, Inc. (Acclarent) received a subpoena from the United States Attorney's Office for the District of Massachusetts requesting documents broadly relating to the sales, marketing and alleged off-label promotion by Acclarent of the RELIEVA STRATUS  MicroFlow Spacer product (the RELIEVA STRATUS  Spacer). In March 2016, Acclarent executed a civil settlement with the United States Justice Department and other agencies to resolve this investigation. Johnson  Johnson was not a party to this settlement and there was no admission of liability. In a separate matter, in July 2016, the former President/CEO and Vice President of Sales of Acclarent (the former Acclarent officers), were convicted of misdemeanor violations in connection with the sale and marketing of the RELIEVA STRATUS  Spacer. There are no charges against Acclarent, Ethicon, Inc. or Johnson  Johnson in this matter. In August 2012, DePuy Orthopaedics, Inc., DePuy, Inc. (now DePuy Synthes, Inc.), and Johnson  Johnson Services, Inc. received an informal request from the United States Attorney's Office for the District of Massachusetts and the Civil Division of the United States Department of Justice (the United States) for the production of materials relating to the DePuy ASR XL Hip device. In July 2014, the United States notified the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts that it had declined to intervene in a qui tam case filed pursuant to the False Claims Act against the companies. In February 2016, the District Court granted the companies motion to dismiss with prejudice, unsealed the qui tam complaint, and denied the qui tam  ##TABLE_START  ##TABLE_END relators request for leave to file a further amended complaint. The qui tam relators appealed the case to the United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit. The First Circuit's decision in the case is pending. Since October 2013, a group of State Attorneys General have issued Civil Investigative Demands relating to the development, sales and marketing of several of DePuy Orthopaedics, Inc.'s hip products. The states are seeking monetary and injunctive relief. In July 2014, the Oregon Department of Justice, which was investigating these matters independently of the other states, announced a settlement of its ASR XL Hip device investigation for a total payment of $4 million to the State of Oregon. In October 2012, Johnson  Johnson was contacted by the California Attorney General's office regarding a multi-state Attorney General investigation of the marketing of surgical mesh products for hernia and urogynecological purposes by Johnson  Johnson's subsidiary, Ethicon, Inc. (Ethicon). Johnson  Johnson and Ethicon have since entered into a series of tolling agreements with the 47 states and the District of Columbia participating in the multi-state investigation and have responded to Civil Investigative Demands served by certain of the participating states. The states are seeking monetary and injunctive relief. In May 2016, California and Washington filed civil complaints against Johnson  Johnson and Ethicon alleging violations of their consumer protection statutes. In August 2016, Kentucky filed a similar complaint against the companies. Johnson  Johnson and Ethicon have entered into a new tolling agreement with the remaining 44 states and the District of Columbia. In December 2012, Therakos, Inc. (Therakos), formerly a subsidiary of Johnson  Johnson and part of the Ortho-Clinical Diagnostics, Inc. (OCD) franchise, received a letter from the civil division of the United States Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania informing Therakos that the United States Attorney's Office was investigating the sales and marketing of Uvadex  (methoxsalen) and the Uvar Xts  System during the period 2000 to the present. The United States Attorney's Office requested that OCD and Johnson  Johnson preserve documents that could relate to the investigation. Therakos was subsequently acquired by an affiliate of Gores Capital Partners III, L.P. in January 2013, and OCD was divested in June 2014. Following the divestiture of OCD, Johnson  Johnson retains OCDs portion of any liability that may result from the investigation for activity that occurred prior to the sale of Therakos. In March 2014 and March 2016, the United States Attorneys Office requested that Johnson  Johnson produce certain documents, and Johnson  Johnson is cooperating with the requests. In June 2014, the Mississippi Attorney General filed a complaint in Chancery Court of The First Judicial District of Hinds County, Mississippi against Johnson  Johnson and Johnson  Johnson Consumer Companies, Inc. (now Johnson  Johnson Consumer Inc.) (JJCI). The complaint alleges that defendants failed to disclose alleged health risks associated with female consumers' use of talc contained in JOHNSON'S  Baby Powder and JOHNSON'S  Shower to Shower (a product no longer sold by JJCI) and seeks injunctive and monetary relief. This matter is currently scheduled for trial in September 2017. In March 2016, Janssen Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (JPI) received a Civil Investigative Demand from the United States Attorneys Office for the Southern District of New York related to JPIs contractual relationships with pharmacy benefit managers over the period from January 1, 2006 to the present with regard to certain of JPI's pharmaceutical products. The demand was issued in connection with an investigation under the False Claims Act. In January 2017, Janssen Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (JPI) received a Civil Investigative Demand (CID) from the United States Department of Justice (DOJ) relating to allegations concerning the sales and marketing practices of OLYSIO TM . JPI is cooperating with DOJ in appropriately responding to the CID. In February 2017, Johnson  Johnson received a subpoena from the United States Attorney's Office for the District of Massachusetts seeking the production of records pertaining to payments to any 501(c)(3) charitable organization that provides financial assistance to Medicare patients. Multiple pharmaceutical companies have publicly reported receipt of similar subpoenas and ongoing inquiries. In recent years, Johnson  Johnson has received numerous requests from a variety of United States Congressional Committees to produce information relevant to ongoing congressional inquiries. It is the policy of Johnson  Johnson to cooperate with these inquiries by producing the requested information. GENERAL LITIGATION In June 2009, following the public announcement that Ortho-Clinical Diagnostics, Inc. (OCD) had received a grand jury subpoena from the United States Department of Justice, Antitrust Division, in connection with an investigation that has since been closed, multiple class action complaints were filed against OCD by direct purchasers seeking damages for alleged price fixing. These cases were consolidated for pre-trial purposes in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania as In re Blood Reagent Antitrust Litigation. In August 2012, the District Court granted a motion filed by the plaintiffs for class certification. In April 2015, the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit reversed the class  ##TABLE_START  ##TABLE_END certification ruling and remanded the case to the District Court for further proceedings. In October 2015, the District Court again granted the motion by the plaintiffs for class certification. In July 2016, OCD filed a motion for summary judgment. OCD was divested in 2014 and Johnson  Johnson retained any liability that may result from these cases. In September 2011, Johnson  Johnson, Johnson  Johnson Inc. and McNeil Consumer Healthcare Division of Johnson  Johnson Inc. received a Notice of Civil Claim filed by Nick Field in the Supreme Court of British Columbia, Canada (the BC Civil Claim). The BC Civil Claim is a putative class action brought on behalf of persons who reside in British Columbia and who purchased during the period between September 20, 2001 and in or about December 2010 one or more various McNeil infants' or children's over-the-counter medicines that were manufactured at the Fort Washington, Pennsylvania facility. The BC Civil Claim alleges that the defendants violated the BC Business Practices and Consumer Protection Act, and other Canadian statutes and common laws, by selling medicines that were allegedly not safe and/or effective or did not comply with Canadian Good Manufacturing Practices. The class certification hearing scheduled for October 2015 was adjourned, and there is currently no date set for that hearing. In May 2014, two purported class actions were filed in federal court, one in the United States District Court for the Central District of California and one in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Illinois, against Johnson  Johnson (JJ) and Johnson  Johnson Consumer Companies, Inc. (now Johnson  Johnson Consumer Inc.) (JJCI), alleging violations of state consumer fraud statutes based on nondisclosure of alleged health risks associated with talc contained in JOHNSON'S  Baby Powder and JOHNSON'S  Shower to Shower (a product no longer sold by JJCI). Both cases seek injunctive relief and monetary damages; neither includes a claim for personal injuries. In October 2016, both cases were transferred to the United States District Court for the District Court of New Jersey as part of a newly created federal multi-district litigation. In December 2016, JJ and JJCI filed a motion to dismiss one of the cases. In August 2014, United States Customs and Border Protection (US CBP) issued a Penalty Notice against Janssen Ortho LLC (Janssen Ortho), assessing penalties for the alleged improper classification of darunavir ethanolate (the active pharmaceutical ingredient in PREZISTA  ) in connection with its importation into the United States. In October 2014, Janssen Ortho submitted a Petition for Relief in response to the Penalty Notice. In May 2015, US CBP issued an Amended Penalty Notice assessing substantial penalties and Janssen Ortho filed its Petition for Relief in July 2015. In March and April 2015, over 30 putative class action complaints were filed by contact lens patients in a number of courts around the United States against Johnson  Johnson Vision Care, Inc. (JJVCI), other contact lens manufacturers, distributors, and retailers, alleging vertical and horizontal conspiracies to fix the retail prices of contact lenses. The complaints allege that the manufacturers reached agreements with each other and certain distributors and retailers concerning the prices at which some contact lenses could be sold to consumers. The plaintiffs are seeking damages and injunctive relief. All of the class action cases were transferred to the United States District Court for the Middle District of Florida in June 2015. The plaintiffs filed a Consolidated Class Action complaint in November 2015, and in December 2015, JJVCI and other defendants filed motions to dismiss. In June 2016, the Court denied the motions to dismiss. Discovery is ongoing. In April 2015, Johnson  Johnson Vision Care, Inc. (JJVCI) filed a complaint in the United States District Court for the District of Utah against the State of Utah seeking a declaratory judgment that a law passed by the State to ban unilateral pricing policies solely in the contact lens market violates the Commerce Clause of the United States Constitution. The Court denied JJVCI's motion for a preliminary injunction. JJVCI appealed. Argument on the appeal was held in August 2015. In December 2016, the appellate court denied JJVCI's appeal. In April 2015, Adimmune Corporation Ltd (Adimmune) commenced an arbitration in the International Court of Arbitration - International Chamber of Commerce against Crucell Switzerland AG (now Janssen Vaccines AG) and Crucell Holland B.V. (now Janssen Vaccines  Prevention B.V.) (collectively, Crucell). Adimmune claims that Crucell breached certain agreements relating to the supply of flu antigen when Crucell ceased purchasing flu antigen from Adimmune. In December 2015, Adimmune filed its Statement of Claim seeking monetary damages. The arbitration hearing took place in November 2016 and the parties are awaiting a ruling. In August 2015, two third-party payors filed a purported class action in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Louisiana against Janssen Research  Development, LLC, Janssen Ortho LLC, Janssen Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Ortho-McNeil-Janssen Pharmaceuticals, Inc. and Johnson  Johnson (as well as certain Bayer entities), alleging that the defendants improperly marketed and promoted XARELTO  as safer and more effective than less expensive alternative medications while failing to fully disclose its risks. The complaint seeks damages in an unspecified amount. Johnson  Johnson or its subsidiaries are also parties to a number of proceedings brought under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act, commonly known as Superfund, and comparable state, local or foreign laws in which the primary relief sought is the cost of past and/or future remediation.  ##TABLE_START  ##TABLE_END 22. Restructuring The Company announced restructuring actions in its Medical Devices segment to better serve the needs of patients and customers in todays evolving healthcare marketplace. The Company is undertaking actions to strengthen its go-to-market model, accelerate the pace of innovation, further prioritize key platforms and geographies, and streamline operations while maintaining high quality standards. The Company estimates that, in connection with its plans, it will record pre-tax restructuring related charges of approximately $2.0 billion to $2.4 billion . In 2016, the Company recorded a pre-tax charge of $685 million , of which $45 million was included in cost of products sold and $149 million was included in other (income) expense. See table below for additional details. Total project costs of $1.275 billion have been recorded since the restructuring has been announced. Additionally, as part of the plan, the Company expects that the restructuring actions will result in position eliminations of approximately 4 to 6 percent of the Medical Devices segments global workforce over the next two years, subject to any consultation procedures in countries, where required. Approximately 1,500 positions have been eliminated since the restructuring was announced. The Company estimates that approximately one-half of the cumulative pre-tax costs will result in cash outlays, including approximately $500 million of employee severance. Approximately one half of the cumulative pre-tax costs are non-cash, relating primarily to facility rationalization, inventory write-offs and intangible asset write-offs. The following table summarizes the severance charges and the associated spending under this initiative through the fiscal year ended 2016: ##TABLE_START (Dollars in Millions) Severance Asset Write-offs Other** Total 2015 restructuring charge $ 86 590      2015 activity  (86 ) (3 ) (89 )      Reserve balance, January 3, 2016  501      Current year activity: Charges  436 Cash payments (104 )  (452 ) (556 ) Settled non cash  (249 )  (249 )      Reserve balance, January 1, 2017* $  381      ##TABLE_END*Cash outlays for severance are expected to be substantially paid out over the next 18 months in accordance with the Company's plans and local laws. **Other includes project expense such as salaries for employees supporting the initiative and consulting expenses.  ##TABLE_START  ##TABLE_END Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm To the Shareholders and Board of Directors of Johnson  Johnson In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and the related consolidated statements of earnings, of comprehensive income, of equity, and of cash flows present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Johnson  Johnson and its subsidiaries at January 1, 2017 and January 3, 2016, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended January 1, 2017  in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of January 1, 2017, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). The Company's management is responsible for these financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying  Management's Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express opinions on these financial statements and on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our integrated audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audits of the financial statements included examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions. As discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company changed the manner in which it accounts for and presents certain elements of share based payments in 2016.  A companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. /s/ PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP Florham Park, New Jersey February 27, 2017  ##TABLE_START  ##TABLE_END Managements Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting Under Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, management is required to assess the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting as of the end of each fiscal year and report, based on that assessment, whether the Companys internal control over financial reporting is effective. Management of the Company is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. The Companys internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance as to the reliability of the Companys financial reporting and the preparation of external financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Internal controls over financial reporting, no matter how well designed, have inherent limitations. Therefore, internal control over financial reporting determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and may not prevent or detect all misstatements. Moreover, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. The Companys management has assessed the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting as of January 1, 2017. In making this assessment, the Company used the criteria established by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013). These criteria are in the areas of control environment, risk assessment, control activities, information and communication, and monitoring. The Companys assessment included extensive documenting, evaluating and testing the design and operating effectiveness of its internal controls over financial reporting. Based on the Companys processes and assessment, as described above, management has concluded that, as of January 1, 2017, the Companys internal control over financial reporting was effective. The effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting as of January 1, 2017 has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report, which appears herein. ##TABLE_START /s/ Alex Gorsky  /s/ Dominic J.

However, the principal markets, products and methods of distribution in the international business vary with the country and the culture. The products sold in international business include those developed in the U.S. and by subsidiaries abroad. Investments and activities in some countries outside the U.S. are subject to higher risks than comparable U.S. activities because the investment and commercial climate may be influenced by financial instability in international economies, restrictive economic policies and political and legal system uncertainties. Raw Materials Raw materials essential to the Company's business are generally readily available from multiple sources. Where there are exceptions, the temporary unavailability of those raw materials would not likely have a material adverse effect on the financial results of the Company. Patents The Company's subsidiaries have made a practice of obtaining patent protection on their products and processes where possible. They own, or are licensed under, a significant number of patents in the U.S. and other countries relating to their products, product uses, formulations and manufacturing processes, which in the aggregate are believed to be of material importance to the Company in the operation of its businesses. The Companys subsidiaries face patent challenges from third parties, including challenges seeking to manufacture and market generic and biosimilar versions of the Company's key pharmaceutical products prior to expiration of the applicable patents covering those products. Significant legal proceedings and claims involving the Company's patent and other intellectual property are described in Note 21, Legal ProceedingsIntellectual Property of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Report. Sales of the Companys largest product, REMICADE  (infliximab), accounted for approximately 8.3% of the Company's total net trade sales for fiscal 2017. There are two sets of patents related specifically to REMICADE  . The first set of patents is co-owned by Janssen Biotech, Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of Johnson  Johnson, and NYU Langone Medical Center (NYU). Janssen Biotech, Inc. has an exclusive license to NYU's interests in the patents. These patents have expired in all countries outside the United States.  In the United States, the one remaining patent, which expires in September 2018, stands rejected following  ##TABLE_START  ##TABLE_END reexamination proceedings instituted by a third party in the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO). The patent has also been held invalid by the Federal District Court in the District of Massachusetts. In January 2018, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit affirmed the invalidity of the remaining patent. The second set of patents specifically related to REMICADE  was granted to The Kennedy Institute of Rheumatology in Europe, Canada, Australia and the United States. Janssen Biotech, Inc. has licenses (exclusive for human anti-TNF antibodies and semi-exclusive for non-human anti-TNF antibodies) to these patents, which expired in 2017 outside of the United States and will expire in August 2018 in the United States. Certain of these patents have been successfully challenged and invalidated, and others are under review in various patent offices around the world and are also subject to litigation in Canada. The Company does not expect that any extensions will be available for the above described patents specifically related to REMICADE  . In the United States, a biosimilar version of REMICADE  was introduced in 2016, and additional competitors continue to enter the market. For a more extensive description of legal matters regarding the patents related to REMICADE  , see Note 21 Legal Proceedings  Intellectual Property  Pharmaceutical  REMICADE  Related Cases of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Report. In addition to competing in the immunology market with REMICADE  , the Company is currently marketing STELARA  (ustekinumab), SIMPONI  (golimumab), SIMPONI ARIA  (golimumab) and TREMFYA  (guselkumab), next generation immunology products with remaining patent lives of up to six years. Trademarks The Companys subsidiaries have made a practice of selling their products under trademarks and of obtaining protection for these trademarks by all available means. These trademarks are protected by registration in the U.S. and other countries where such products are marketed. The Company considers these trademarks in the aggregate to be of material importance in the operation of its businesses. Seasonality Worldwide sales do not reflect any significant degree of seasonality; however, spending has been heavier in the fourth quarter of each year than in other quarters. This reflects increased spending decisions, principally for advertising and research and development activity. Competition In all of their product lines, the Company's subsidiaries compete with companies both locally and globally. Competition exists in all product lines without regard to the number and size of the competing companies involved. Competition in research, both internally and externally sourced, involving the development and the improvement of new and existing products and processes, is particularly significant. The development of new and innovative products, as well as protecting the underlying intellectual property of the Companys product portfolio, is important to the Company's success in all areas of its business. The competitive environment requires substantial investments in continuing research. In addition, the development and maintenance of customer demand for the Companys consumer products involve significant expenditures for advertising and promotion. Research and Development Research activities represent a significant part of the Companys businesses. Research and development expenditures relate to the processes of discovering, testing and developing new products, upfront payments and milestones, improving existing products, as well as demonstrating product efficacy and regulatory compliance prior to launch. The Company remains committed to investing in research and development with the aim of delivering high quality and innovative products. Worldwide costs of research and development activities amounted to $10.6 billion, $9.1 billion and $9.0 billion for fiscal years 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Research facilities are located in the United States, Belgium, Brazil, Canada, China, France, Germany, Israel, Japan, the Netherlands, Switzerland and the United Kingdom with additional RD support in over 30 other countries. Environment The Company is subject to a variety of U.S. and international environmental protection measures. The Company believes that its operations comply in all material respects with applicable environmental laws and regulations. The Companys compliance with these requirements did not change during the past year, and is not expected to have a material effect upon its capital expenditures, cash flows, earnings or competitive position.  ##TABLE_START  ##TABLE_END Regulation The Companys businesses are subject to varying degrees of governmental regulation in the countries in which operations are conducted, and the general trend is toward increasingly stringent regulation. In the U.S., the drug, device and cosmetic industries have long been subject to regulation by various federal and state agencies, primarily as to product safety, efficacy, manufacturing, advertising, labeling and safety reporting. The exercise of broad regulatory powers by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (the FDA) continues to result in increases in the amounts of testing and documentation required for FDA approval of new drugs and devices and a corresponding increase in the expense of product introduction. Similar trends are also evident in major markets outside of the U.S. The new medical device regulatory framework and the new privacy regulations in Europe are examples of such increased regulation. The costs of human health care have been and continue to be a subject of study, investigation and regulation by governmental agencies and legislative bodies around the world. In the U.S., attention has been focused on drug prices and profits and programs that encourage doctors to write prescriptions for particular drugs, or to recommend, use or purchase particular medical devices. Payers have become a more potent force in the market place and increased attention is being paid to drug and medical device pricing, appropriate drug and medical device utilization and the quality and costs of health care generally. U.S. government agencies continue to implement the extensive requirements of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (the ACA). These have both positive and negative impacts on the U.S. healthcare industry with much remaining uncertain as to how various provisions of the ACA, and potential modification or repeal of ACA provisions, will ultimately affect the industry. The regulatory agencies under whose purview the Company operates have administrative powers that may subject it to actions such as product withdrawals, recalls, seizure of products and other civil and criminal sanctions. In some cases, the Companys subsidiaries may deem it advisable to initiate product recalls. In addition, business practices in the health care industry have come under increased scrutiny, particularly in the United States, by government agencies and state attorneys general, and resulting investigations and prosecutions carry the risk of significant civil and criminal penalties. Further, the Company relies on global supply chains, and production and distribution processes, that are complex, are subject to increasing regulatory requirements, and may be faced with unexpected changes such as those resulting from Brexit, that may affect sourcing, supply and pricing of materials used in the Company's products. These processes also are subject to lengthy regulatory approvals. Available Information The Companys main corporate website address is www.jnj.com.

RISK FACTORS ##TABLE_END The Company faces a number of uncertainties and risks that are difficult to predict and many of which are outside of the Company's control. In addition to the other information in this report and the Companys other filings with the SEC, investors should consider carefully the factors set forth below. Investors should be aware that it is not possible to predict or identify all such factors and that the following is not meant to be a complete discussion of all potential risks or uncertainties. If known or unknown risks or uncertainties materialize, the Companys business, results of operations or financial condition could be adversely affected, potentially in a material way. The Companys largest product, REMICADE  (infliximab), is experiencing biosimilar competition, which will result in a reduction in U.S. sales of REMICADE  . The Company has experienced significant challenges to patents covering its largest product, REMICADE  (infliximab) (accounting for approximately 8.3% of the Companys total net trade sales for fiscal 2017), and continues to assert certain patents related to the product. In the United States, a biosimilar version of REMICADE  was introduced in 2016, and additional competitors continue to enter the market. Sales of infliximab biosimilars in the U.S. market will result in a continued reduction in U.S. sales of REMICADE  . Global sales in the Companys pharmaceutical and medical devices segments may be negatively impacted by healthcare reforms and increasing pricing pressures. Sales of the Companys pharmaceutical and medical device products are significantly affected by reimbursements by third-party payers such as government healthcare programs, private insurance plans and managed care organizations. As part of various efforts to contain healthcare costs, these payers are putting downward pressure on prices at which products will be reimbursed. In the United States, increased purchasing power of entities that negotiate on behalf of Medicare, Medicaid, and private sector beneficiaries, in part due to continued consolidation among health care providers, could result in further pricing pressures. In addition, increased political scrutiny could result in additional pricing pressures. Outside the United States, numerous major markets, including the EU and Japan, have pervasive government involvement in funding healthcare and, in that regard, directly or indirectly impose price controls, limit access to, or reimbursement for, the Companys products, or reduce the value of its intellectual property protection. The Company is subject to significant legal proceedings that can result in significant expenses, fines and reputational damage. In the ordinary course of business, Johnson  Johnson and its subsidiaries are subject to numerous claims and lawsuits involving various issues such as patent disputes, product liability and claims that their product sales, marketing and pricing practices violate various antitrust, unfair trade practices and/or consumer protection laws. The most significant of these proceedings are described in Note 21, Legal Proceedings under Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Report. While the Company believes it has substantial defenses in these matters, it is not feasible to predict the ultimate outcome of litigation. The Company could in the future be required to pay significant amounts as a result of settlements or judgments in these matters, potentially in excess of accruals. The resolution of, or increase in accruals for, one or more of these matters in any reporting period could have a material adverse effect on the Company's results of operations and cash flows for that period. Furthermore, as a result of cost and availability factors, effective November 1, 2005, the Company ceased purchasing third-party product liability insurance. Product reliability, safety and effectiveness concerns can have significant negative impacts on sales and results of operations, lead to litigation and cause reputational damage. Concerns about product safety, whether raised internally or by litigants, regulators or consumer advocates, and whether or not based on scientific evidence, can result in safety alerts, product recalls, governmental investigations, regulatory action on the part of the FDA (or its counterpart in other countries), private claims and lawsuits, payment of fines and settlements, declining sales and reputational damage. These circumstances can also result in damage to brand image, brand equity and consumer trust in the Companys products. Product recalls have in the past, and could in the future, prompt government investigations and inspections, the shutdown of manufacturing facilities, continued product shortages and related sales declines, significant remediation costs, reputational damage, possible civil penalties and criminal prosecution. Changes in tax laws or exposures to additional tax liabilities could negatively impact the Companys operating results. Changes in tax laws or regulations could negatively impact the Companys effective tax rate and results of operations. On December 22, 2017, the U.S. enacted The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the TCJA), which resulted in the revaluation of the Companys U.S. related deferred tax assets and liabilities and had an impact on the Companys Consolidated Statement of Earnings. The TCJA introduces significant changes to U.S. corporate income tax law that will have a meaningful impact on the  ##TABLE_START  ##TABLE_END Companys provision for income taxes. Accounting for the income tax effects of the TCJA requires significant judgments to be made in interpreting its provisions. Due to the timing of the enactment and the complexity involved in applying the provisions of the TCJA, the Company made reasonable estimates of the effects and recorded provisional amounts in the financial statements for fiscal year 2017. These provisional amounts are based on the Companys initial analysis of the TCJA as of January 18, 2018. Anticipated guidance from the U.S. Treasury about implementing the TCJA, and the potential for additional guidance from the Securities and Exchange Commission or the Financial Accounting Standards Board related to the TCJA, may result in adjustments to these estimates which could materially affect the Companys financial position and results of operations as well as the effective tax rate in the period in which the adjustments are made. The government in Switzerland is currently considering tax reform legislation, which could have a material impact on the Companys effective tax rate if enacted into law. The Company conducts business and files tax returns in numerous countries and is addressing tax audits and disputes with many tax authorities. In connection with the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (BEPS) project, companies are required to disclose more information to tax authorities on operations around the world, which may lead to greater audit scrutiny of profits earned in other countries. The Company regularly assesses the likely outcomes of its tax audits and disputes to determine the appropriateness of its tax reserves. However, any tax authority could take a position on tax treatment that is contrary to the Companys expectations, which could result in tax liabilities in excess of reserves. The Company may not be able to successfully secure and defend intellectual property rights essential to the Companys businesses. The Company owns or licenses a significant number of patents and other proprietary rights, determined by patent offices, courts and lawmakers in various countries, relating to its products and manufacturing processes. These rights are essential to the Companys businesses and materially important to the Companys results of operations. Public policy, both within and outside the U.S., has become increasingly unfavorable toward intellectual property rights. The Company cannot be certain that it will obtain adequate patent protection for new products and technologies in the U.S. and other important markets or that such protections, once granted, will last as long as originally anticipated. Competitors routinely challenge the validity or extent of the Companys owned or licensed patents and proprietary rights through litigation, interferences, oppositions and other proceedings. These proceedings absorb resources and can be protracted as well as unpredictable. In addition, challenges that the Companys products infringe the patents of third parties could result in the need to pay past damages and future royalties and adversely affect the competitive position and sales of the products in question. The Company has faced increasing patent challenges from third parties seeking to manufacture and market generic and biosimilar versions of the Company's key pharmaceutical products prior to expiration of the applicable patents covering those products. In the United States, manufacturers of generic versions of innovative human pharmaceutical products may challenge the validity, or claim non-infringement, of innovator products through the Abbreviated New Drug Application, or ANDA, process with the FDA. The Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act (BPCIA), enacted in 2010, which created a new regulatory pathway for the approval by the FDA of biosimilar alternatives to innovator-developed biological products, also created mechanisms for biosimilar applicants to challenge the patents on the innovator biologics. The inter partes review (IPR) process with the USPTO, created under the 2011 America Invents Act, is also being used by competitors to challenge patents held by the Companys subsidiaries. For example, the key patent for ZYTIGA  is currently subject to patent litigation, and the USPTO has issued a decision invalidating that patent in a related IPR action. In the event the Company is not successful in defending its patents against such challenges, or upon the at-risk launch (despite pending patent infringement litigation) by the generic or biosimilar firm of its product, the Company can lose a major portion of revenues for the referenced product in a very short period of time. Current legal proceedings involving the Companys patents and other intellectual property rights are described in Note 21, Legal ProceedingsIntellectual Property of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Report. The Companys businesses operate in highly competitive product markets and competitive pressures could adversely affect the Companys earnings. The Company faces substantial competition in all three operating segments and in all geographic markets. The Companys businesses compete with companies of all sizes on the basis of cost-effectiveness, technological innovations, intellectual property rights, product performance, real or perceived product advantages, pricing and availability and rate of reimbursement. The Company also competes with other market participants in securing rights to acquisitions, collaborations and licensing  ##TABLE_START  ##TABLE_END agreements with third parties. Competition for rights to product candidates and technologies may result in significant investment and acquisition costs and onerous agreement terms for the Company. Competitors development of more effective or less costly products, and/or their ability to secure patent and other intellectual property rights and successfully market products ahead of the Company, could negatively impact sales of the Companys existing products as well as its ability to bring new products to market despite significant prior investment in the related product development. For the Companys pharmaceutical businesses, loss of patent exclusivity for a product often is followed by a substantial reduction in sales as competitors gain regulatory approval for generic and other competing products and enter the market. Similar competition can be triggered by the loss of exclusivity for a biological product. For the Companys medical device businesses, technological innovation, product quality, reputation and customer service are especially important to competitiveness. Development by other companies of new or improved products, processes and technologies could threaten to make the Companys products or technologies less desirable, less economical or obsolete. The Companys consumer businesses face intense competition from other branded products and retailers private-label brands. If the Company fails to sufficiently differentiate and market its brand name consumer products, this could adversely affect revenues and profitability of those products. Significant challenges or delays in the Companys innovation and development of new products, technologies and indications could have an adverse impact on the Companys long-term success. The Companys continued growth and success depends on its ability to innovate and develop new and differentiated products and services that address the evolving health care needs of patients, providers and consumers. Development of successful products and technologies is also necessary to offset revenue losses when the Companys existing products lose market share due to various factors such as competition and loss of patent exclusivity. New products introduced within the past five years accounted for approximately 22% of 2017 sales. The Company cannot be certain when or whether it will be able to develop, license or otherwise acquire companies, products and technologies, whether particular product candidates will be granted regulatory approval, and, if approved, whether the products will be commercially successful. The Company pursues product development through internal research and development as well as through collaborations, acquisitions, joint ventures and licensing or other arrangements with third parties. In all of these contexts, developing new products, particularly pharmaceutical and biotechnology products and medical devices, requires significant investment of resources over many years. Only a very few biopharmaceutical research and development programs result in commercially viable products. The process depends on many factors including the ability to discern patients and health care providers future needs; develop promising new compounds, strategies and technologies; achieve successful clinical trial results; secure effective intellectual property protection; obtain regulatory approvals on a timely basis; and, if and when they reach the market, successfully differentiate the Companys products from competing products and approaches to treatment. New products or enhancements to existing products may not be accepted quickly or significantly in the marketplace due to product and price competition, changes in customer preferences or healthcare purchasing patterns, resistance by healthcare providers or uncertainty over third-party reimbursement. Even following initial regulatory approval, the success of a product can be adversely impacted by safety and efficacy findings in larger real world patient populations, as well as market entry of competitive products. The Company faces increasing regulatory scrutiny which imposes significant compliance costs and exposes the Company to government investigations, legal actions and penalties. Like other companies in the healthcare industry, the Company is subject to extensive regulation, investigations and legal action, by national, state and local government agencies in the United States and other countries in which they operate. Regulatory issues regarding compliance with Good Manufacturing Practices (cGMP) (and comparable quality regulations in foreign countries) by manufacturers of drugs, devices and consumer products can lead to fines and penalties, product recalls, product shortages, interruptions in production, delays in new product approvals and litigation. In addition, the marketing, pricing and sale of the Companys products are subject to regulation, investigations and legal actions including under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, the Medicaid Rebate Program, federal and state false claims acts, state unfair trade practices acts and consumer protection laws. Increased scrutiny of health care industry business practices in recent years by government agencies and state attorneys general in the U.S., and any resulting investigations and prosecutions, carry risk of significant civil and criminal penalties including, but not limited to, debarment from participation in government healthcare programs. Any such debarment could have a material adverse effect on the Companys business and results of operations. The most significant current investigations and litigation brought by government agencies are described in Note 21, Legal Proceedings-Government Proceedings under Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Report.  ##TABLE_START  ##TABLE_END The Company faces a variety of risks associated with conducting business internationally. The Companys extensive operations and business activity outside the U.S. are accompanied by certain financial, economic and political risks, including those listed below. Foreign Currency Exchange : In fiscal 2017, approximately 48% of the Companys sales occurred outside of the U.S., with approximately 22% in Europe, 8% in the Western Hemisphere, excluding the U.S., and 18% in the Asia-Pacific and Africa region. Changes in non-U.S. currencies relative to the U.S. dollar impact the Companys revenues and expenses. While the Company uses financial instruments to mitigate the impact of fluctuations in currency exchange rates on its cash flows, unhedged exposures continue to be subject to currency fluctuations. In addition, the weakening or strengthening of the U.S. dollar may result in significant favorable or unfavorable translation effects when the operating results of the Companys non-U.S. business activity are translated into U.S. dollars. Inflation and Currency Devaluation Risks : The Company faces challenges in maintaining profitability of operations in economies experiencing high inflation rates. The Company has accounted for operations in Venezuela as highly inflationary, as the prior three-year cumulative inflation rate surpassed 100%. While the Company strives to maintain profit margins in these areas through cost reduction programs, productivity improvements and periodic price increases, it might experience operating losses as a result of continued inflation. In addition, the impact of currency devaluations in countries experiencing high inflation rates or significant currency exchange fluctuations could negatively impact the Companys operating results. Illegal Importation of Pharmaceutical Products : The illegal importation of pharmaceutical products from countries where government price controls or other market dynamics result in lower prices may adversely affect the Companys sales and profitability in the U.S. and other countries in which the Company operates. With the exception of limited quantities of prescription drugs for personal use, foreign imports of pharmaceutical products are illegal under current U.S. law. However, the volume of illegal imports continues to rise as the ability of patients and other customers to obtain the lower-priced imports has grown significantly. Anti-Bribery and Other Regulations: The Company is subject to various federal and foreign laws that govern its international business practices with respect to payments to government officials. Those laws include the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA), which prohibits U.S. publicly traded companies from promising, offering, or giving anything of value to foreign officials with the corrupt intent of influencing the foreign official for the purpose of helping the Company obtain or retain business or gain any improper advantage. The Companys business is heavily regulated and therefore involves significant interaction with foreign officials. Also, in many countries outside the U.S., the health care providers who prescribe human pharmaceuticals are employed by the government and the purchasers of human pharmaceuticals are government entities; therefore, the Companys interactions with these prescribers and purchasers are subject to regulation under the FCPA. In addition to the U.S. application and enforcement of the FCPA, various jurisdictions in which the Company operates have laws and regulations, including the U.K Bribery Act 2010, aimed at preventing and penalizing corrupt and anticompetitive behavior. Enforcement activities under these laws could subject the Company to additional administrative and legal proceedings and actions, which could include claims for civil penalties, criminal sanctions, and administrative remedies, including exclusion from health care programs. Other Legal, Social and Political Risks . Other risks inherent in conducting business globally include: ##TABLE_START  protective economic policies taken by governments such as trade protection measures and import/export licensing requirements; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  compliance with local regulations and laws including, in some countries, regulatory requirements restricting the Companys ability to manufacture or sell its products in the relevant market; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  diminished protection of intellectual property and contractual rights in certain jurisdictions; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  potential nationalization or expropriation of the Companys foreign assets; and ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  disruptions to markets due to war, armed conflict, terrorism, social upheavals or pandemics. ##TABLE_END Interruptions and delays in manufacturing operations could adversely affect the Companys business, sales and reputation. The Companys manufacture of products requires the timely delivery of sufficient amounts of complex, high-quality components and materials. The Company's subsidiaries operate 125 manufacturing facilities as well as sourcing from hundreds of suppliers around the world. The Company has in the past, and may in the future, face unanticipated interruptions and delays in manufacturing through its internal or external supply chain. Manufacturing disruptions can occur for many reasons including regulatory action, production quality deviations or safety issues, labor disputes, site-specific incidents (such as fires), natural disasters such as hurricanes and other severe weather events, raw material shortages, political unrest and terrorist attacks. Such  ##TABLE_START  ##TABLE_END delays and difficulties in manufacturing can result in product shortages, declines in sales and reputational impact as well as significant remediation and related costs associated with addressing the shortage. An information security incident, including a cybersecurity breach, could have a negative impact to the Companys business or reputation To meet business objectives, the Company relies on both internal information technology (IT) systems and networks, and those of third parties and their vendors, to process and store sensitive data, including confidential research, business plans, financial information, intellectual property, and personal data that may be subject to legal protection. The extensive information security and cybersecurity threats, which affect companies globally, pose a risk to the security and availability of these IT systems and networks, and the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the Companys sensitive data. The Company continually assesses these threats and makes investments to increase internal protection, detection, and response capabilities, as well as ensure the Companys third party providers have required capabilities and controls, to address this risk. To date, the Company has not experienced any material impact to the business or operations resulting from information or cybersecurity attacks; however, because of the frequently changing attack techniques, along with the increased volume and sophistication of the attacks, there is the potential for the Company to be adversely impacted. This impact could result in reputational, competitive, operational or other business harm as well as financial costs and regulatory action.  ##TABLE_START  ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START ", "1B": " Item 1B.

The Company also engages contract manufacturers. The Company is committed to maintaining all of its properties in good operating condition. McNEIL-PPC, Inc. (now Johnson  Johnson Consumer Inc.) (McNEIL-PPC) continues to operate under a consent decree, signed in 2011 with the FDA, which governs certain McNeil Consumer Healthcare manufacturing operations, and requires McNEIL-PPC to remediate the facilities it operates in Lancaster, Pennsylvania, Fort Washington, Pennsylvania, and Las Piedras, Puerto Rico (the \"Consent Decree\"). Following FDA inspections in 2015, McNEIL-PPC received notifications from the FDA that all three manufacturing facilities are in conformity with applicable laws and regulations, and commercial production has restarted. Under the Consent Decree, after receiving notice from the FDA of being in compliance with applicable laws and regulations, each of the three facilities is subject to a five-year audit period by a third-party cGMP expert. Thus, a third-party expert will continue to reassess the sites at various times until at least 2020.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION ##TABLE_ENDOrganization and Business Segments Description of the Company and Business Segments Johnson  Johnson and its subsidiaries (the Company) have approximately 134,000 employees worldwide engaged in the research and development, manufacture and sale of a broad range of products in the health care field. The Company conducts business in virtually all countries of the world with the primary focus on products related to human health and well-being. The Company is organized into three business segments: Consumer, Pharmaceutical and Medical Devices. The Consumer segment includes a broad range of products used in the baby care, oral care, beauty, over-the-counter pharmaceutical, womens health and wound care markets. These products are marketed to the general public and sold both to retail outlets and distributors throughout the world. The Pharmaceutical segment is focused on six therapeutic areas, including immunology, infectious diseases, neuroscience, oncology, pulmonary hypertension, and cardiovascular and metabolic diseases. Products in this segment are distributed directly to retailers, wholesalers, hospitals and health care professionals for prescription use. The Medical Devices segment includes a broad range of products used in the orthopaedic, surgery, cardiovascular, diabetes care and vision care fields which are distributed to wholesalers, hospitals and retailers, and used principally in the professional fields by physicians, nurses, hospitals, eye care professionals and clinics. The Executive Committee of Johnson  Johnson is the principal management group responsible for the strategic operations and allocation of the resources of the Company. This Committee oversees and coordinates the activities of the Consumer, Pharmaceutical and Medical Devices business segments. In all of its product lines, the Company competes with companies both locally and globally, throughout the world. Competition exists in all product lines without regard to the number and size of the competing companies involved. Competition in research, involving the development and the improvement of new and existing products and processes, is particularly significant. The development of new and innovative products, as well as protecting the underlying intellectual property of the Company's product portfolio, is important to the Companys success in all areas of its business. The competitive environment requires substantial investments in continuing research. In addition, the development and maintenance of customer demand for the Companys consumer products involves significant expenditures for advertising and promotion. Managements Objectives With Our Credo as the foundation, the Companys purpose is to blend heart, science and ingenuity to profoundly change the trajectory of health for humanity. The Company is committed to bringing its full breadth and depth to ensure health for people today and for future generations. United around this common ambition, the Company is poised to fulfill its purpose and successfully meet the demands of the rapidly evolving markets in which it competes. The Company is broadly based in human healthcare, and is committed to creating value by developing accessible, high quality, innovative products and services. New products introduced within the past five years accounted for approximately 22% of 2017 sales. In 2017, $10.6 billion was invested in research and development and $35.2 billion spent on acquisitions, reflecting managements commitment to create life-enhancing innovations and to create value through partnerships that will profoundly change the trajectory of health for humanity. A critical driver of the Companys success, is the 134,000 diverse employees that work across more than 260 operating companies, which are located in more than 60 countries. Employees are empowered and inspired to lead with the Companys Our Credo and purpose as guides. This allows every employee to use the Companys reach and size to advance the Company's purpose, and to also lead with agility and urgency. Leveraging the extensive resources across the enterprise, enables the Company to innovate and execute with excellence. This ensures the Company can remain focused on addressing the unmet needs of society every day and invest for an enduring impact, ultimately delivering value to its patients, consumers and healthcare professionals, employees, communities and shareholders.    ##TABLE_START  ##TABLE_END Results of Operations Analysis of Consolidated Sales In 2017, worldwide sales increased 6.3% to $76.5 billion, compared to an increase of 2.6% in 2016 and a decrease of 5.7% in 2015.

Growth was driven by strong uptake of STELARA  (ustekinumab), the launch of TREMFYA  (guselkumab) and sales growth of SIMPONI  /SIMPONI ARIA  (golimumab) outside the U.S. Lower sales of REMICADE  (infliximab) were due to increased discounts/rebates and biosimilar competition. The patents for REMICADE  (infliximab) in certain countries in Europe expired in February 2015. Biosimilar versions of REMICADE  have been introduced in certain markets outside the United States, resulting in a reduction in sales of REMICADE  in those markets. Additional biosimilar competition will likely result in a further reduction in REMICADE  sales in markets outside the United States. In the United States, a biosimilar version of REMICADE  was introduced in 2016, and additional competitors continue to enter the market. Continued infliximab biosimilar competition in the U.S. market will result in a further reduction in U.S. sales of REMICADE  . The Company continues to assert REMICADE  related patent rights. See Note 21 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a description of legal matters regarding the REMICADE  patents. Infectious disease products sales were $3.2 billion, a decline of 1.7% from 2016. Lower sales of OLYSIO  (simeprevir), vaccines and PREZISTA  (darunavir/cobicistat) were partially offset by sales growth of EDURANT  /rilpivirine, PREZCOBIX  /REZOLSTA  and the launch of SYMTUZA  . Neuroscience products sales were $6.0 billion, a decrease of 1.6% from 2016. Lower sales of RISPERDAL CONSTA  (risperidone) and CONCERTA  /methylphenidate as well as the impact of divestitures were partially offset by strong sales of INVEGA SUSTENNA  /XEPLION  / TRINZA  /TREVICTA  (paliperidone palmitate) long-acting injectables. Oncology products achieved sales of $7.3 billion in 2017, representing an increase of 25.0% as compared to the prior year. Contributors to the growth of Oncology products were strong sales of DARZALEX  (daratumumab) and IMBRUVICA  (ibrutinib) driven by market share and market growth and sales of ZYTIGA  (abiraterone acetate) driven by market growth. Several generic companies are challenging the remaining patent for ZYTIGA  in the USPTO and in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey. The Company is appealing a decision by the USPTO invalidating this patent, and the parties are awaiting a decision on a motion for summary judgment of non-infringement filed by the generic companies. In the event that the rulings are unfavorable to the Company, a generic launch is expected to follow. If there is a launch of a generic version of ZYTIGA  following FDA approval, it will result in a reduction in U.S. sales, and such reduction could occur in a short period of time. In 2017, the Company reported U.S. sales of $1.2 billion for ZYTIGA  . See Note 21 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a description of legal matters regarding ZYTIGA  . Pulmonary Hypertension is a new therapeutic area which was established with the acquisition of Actelion Ltd on June 16, 2017. See Note 20 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional details regarding the acquisition. Cardiovascular/Metabolism/Other products sales were $6.3 billion, a decline of 1.7% as compared to the prior year attributable to lower sales of INVOKANA  /INVOKAMET  (canagliflozin) in the U.S. primarily due to an increase in price discounts and market share decline driven by competitive pressure. This was partially offset by sales growth of XARELTO  (rivaroxaban) due to increased market growth and market share, as well as sales of non-PAH (pulmonary arterial hypertension) products from the Actelion acquisition.  ##TABLE_START  ##TABLE_END During 2017, the Company advanced its pipeline with several regulatory submissions and approvals for new drugs and additional indications for existing drugs as follows: ##TABLE_START Product Name (Chemical Name) Indication US Approv EU Approv US Filing EU Filing apalutamide An oral androgen receptor inhibitor for men with non-metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer     DARZALEX  (daratumumab) In combination with lenalidomide and dexamethasone, or bortezomib and dexamethasone, for the treatment of patients with multiple myeloma who have received at least one prior therapy      In combination with pomalidomide and dexamethasone, or bortezomib and dexamethasone, for the treatment of patients with multiple myeloma who have received at least two prior therapies      Frontline multiple myeloma transplant ineligible patients in combination with bortezomib, melphalan, and prednisone     IMBRUVICA  (ibrutinib) Treatment for adult patients with chronic graft-versus-host-disease after failure of one or more lines of systemic therapy      Marginal zone lymphoma     INVOKANA  (canagliflozin) Reduce the risk of death in type 2 diabetes with established, or risk for, cardiovascular disease.

U.S. sales were $20.1 billion, an increase of 9.8%. International sales were $13.3 billion, an increase of 1.8%, which included 4.0% operational growth partially offset by a negative currency impact of 2.2%. In 2016, acquisitions, divestitures and competitive products to the Company's Hepatitis C products, OLYSIO  /SOVRIAD  (simeprevir) and INCIVO  (telaprevir), had a negative impact of 2.5% on the operational growth of the Pharmaceutical segment. In 2016, the Pharmaceutical segment operational growth was negatively impacted by 1.5% due to additional shipping days in 2015. The Pharmaceutical segment operational growth for 2016, as compared to the prior year, was not impacted by adjustments to previous reserve estimates as both periods included approximately $0.5 billion of adjustments.  ##TABLE_START  ##TABLE_END Medical Devices Segment The Medical Devices segment sales in 2017 were $26.6 billion, an increase of 5.9% from 2016, which included an operational increase of 5.7% and a positive currency impact of 0.2%.

Growth in Advanced Surgery was primarily driven by endocutter, energy, including the acquisition of Megadyne Medical Products, Inc., and biosurgery products. Growth in General Surgery was primarily driven by sutures and sales from the acquisition of Torax Medical, Inc. The sales decline in Specialty Surgery was primarily due to lower sales of aesthetic, Advanced Sterilization and Sterilmed products. The Orthopaedics franchise sales were $9.3 billion in 2017, a decrease of 0.8% from 2016. The decline in Spine  Other was primarily due to the Codman Neurosurgery divestiture, share loss in U.S. Spine, pricing and competitive pressures. This was partially offset by sales growth of trauma, sports medicine products and U.S. hips. The Vision Care franchise achieved sales of $4.1 billion in 2017, an increase of 45.9% from 2016. Growth was driven by sales from the acquisition of AMO, with the majority of AMO sales in the surgical category, and new product launches in the contact lenses category. The Cardiovascular franchise sales were $2.1 billion, an increase of 13.4% from 2016. Strong growth in the electrophysiology business was driven by market growth and continued uptake of the THERMOCOOL SMARTTOUCH  Contact Force Sensing Catheter. The Diabetes Care franchise sales were $1.6 billion, a decrease of 9.7% from 2016. The decline was primarily due to price declines and competitive pressures. Additionally, in the fourth quarter of 2017, the Company announced its decision to exit the Animas insulin pump business. Animas has selected Medtronic plc to facilitate a seamless transition for patients, caregivers and healthcare providers. The Company is continuing to evaluate potential strategic options for LifeScan, Inc. and determine the best opportunity to drive future growth and maximize shareholder value. The Medical Devices segment sales in 2016 were $25.1 billion, a decrease of 0.1% from 2015, which included an operational increase of 0.9% and a negative currency impact of 1.0%. U.S. sales were $12.3 billion, an increase of 1.1% as compared to the prior year. International sales were $12.9 billion, a decrease of 1.2% as compared to the prior year, with an operational increase of 0.7% and a negative currency impact of 1.9%. In 2016, acquisitions and divestitures had a negative  ##TABLE_START  ##TABLE_END impact of 1.8% on the worldwide operational growth of the Medical Devices segment as compared to 2015. In 2016, the Medical Devices segment operational growth was negatively impacted by 0.9% due to additional shipping days in 2015. Analysis of Consolidated Earnings Before Provision for Taxes on Income Consolidated earnings before provision for taxes on income decreased to $17.7 billion in 2017, as compared to $19.8 billion in 2016, a decrease of 10.8%. The decrease was primarily attributable to higher amortization expense and other charges related to recent acquisitions, higher selling, marketing and administrative costs due to investments in new product launches and higher research and development costs due to general portfolio progression and collaborations. Consolidated earnings before provision for taxes on income increased to $19.8 billion in 2016, as compared to $19.2 billion in 2015, an increase of 3.2%. The increase was primarily attributable to higher sales volume, favorable mix in the business and lower selling, marketing and administrative costs. This was partially offset by higher net litigation expense of $0.7 billion and a higher restructuring charge of $0.1 billion as compared to 2015. Additionally, the fiscal year 2015 included higher gains on the sale of assets/businesses as compared to 2016. As a percent to sales, consolidated earnings before provision for taxes on income in 2017 was 23.1% versus 27.5% in 2016. Cost of Products Sold and Selling, Marketing and Administrative Expenses: Cost of products sold and selling, marketing and administrative expenses as a percent to sales were as follows: ##TABLE_START % of Sales    Cost of products sold  33.2 %  30.2 %  30.7 Percent point increase/(decrease) over the prior year  3.0  (0.5 )  0.1 Selling, marketing and administrative expenses  28.0 %  27.7 %  30.3 Percent point increase/(decrease) over the prior year  0.3  (2.6 )  0.8 ##TABLE_ENDIn 2017, cost of products sold as a percent to sales increased to 33.2% from 30.2% as compared to the same period a year ago.  The unfavorable increase was primarily driven by $2.3 billion of higher amortization expense and charges for inventory step-up related to the recent acquisitions, primarily Actelion. Intangible asset amortization expense of $3.0 billion was included in cost of products sold for 2017 as compared to $1.2 billion in 2016. There was an increase in the percent to sales of selling, marketing and administrative expenses in 2017 as compared to the prior year, primarily due to investments in new product launches partially offset by favorable mix. In 2016, cost of products sold as a percent to sales decreased to 30.2% from 30.7% as compared to the same period a year ago. Favorable mix in the business and cost improvement programs was partially offset by the unfavorable impact of transactional currency. Intangible asset amortization expense of $1.2 billion was included in cost of products sold for 2016 and 2015. There was a decrease in the percent to sales of selling, marketing and administrative expenses in 2016 compared to the prior year, primarily due to cost management in all the segments and favorable mix. Research and Development Expense: Research and development expense by segment of business was as follows: ##TABLE_START     (Dollars in Millions)  Amount  % of Sales*  Amount  % of Sales*  Amount  % of Sales* Consumer  $  4.3 %  $  4.4 %   4.6 Pharmaceutical  8,360  23.1  6,967  20.8  6,821  21.7 Medical Devices  1,610  6.1  1,548  6.2  1,600  6.4 Total research and development expense  $ 10,554  13.8 %  $ 9,095  12.7 %  9,046  12.9 Percent increase/(decrease) over the prior year  16.0 %    0.5 %    6.5   ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START * As a percent to segment sales ##TABLE_ENDResearch and development activities represent a significant part of the Company's business. These expenditures relate to the processes of discovering, testing and developing new products, upfront payments and milestones, improving existing products, as well as ensuring product efficacy and regulatory compliance prior to launch. The Company remains committed to investing in research and development with the aim of delivering high quality and innovative products. In 2017, worldwide costs of research and development activities increased by 16.0% compared to 2016. The increase as a percent of sales was primarily in the pharmaceutical segment due to general portfolio progression as well as collaborative agreements entered into with Idorsia Ltd. and Legend Biotech. In 2016, worldwide costs of research and development activities increased by 0.5% compared to  ##TABLE_START  ##TABLE_END 2015 but decreased as a percent of sales. The decrease as a percent of sales was attributable to higher overall sales in the Pharmaceutical segment. The increased dollar spend in the Pharmaceutical segment was for investment spending to advance the pipeline. In-Process Research and Development (IPRD): In 2017, the Company recorded an IPRD charge of $0.4 billion primarily for the discontinuation of certain development projects related to Novira which was acquired in 2015. The product development was canceled due to safety concerns. In 2016, the Company recorded an IPRD charge of $29 million for the discontinuation of a development program related to Crucell. In 2015, the Company recorded an IPRD charge of $0.2 billion primarily for the discontinuation of certain development projects related to Covagen. Other (Income) Expense, Net: Other (income) expense, net is the account where the Company records gains and losses related to the sale and write-down of certain investments in equity securities held by Johnson  Johnson Innovation - JJDC, Inc. (JJDC), gains and losses on divestitures, transactional currency gains and losses, acquisition-related costs, litigation accruals and settlements, as well as royalty income. The change in other (income) expense, net for the fiscal year 2017 was a favorable change of $0.3 billion due to higher gains of $0.7 billion on the sale of assets/businesses, primarily the Codman Neurosurgery and COMPEED  divestitures, a gain of $0.2 billion related to monetization of future royalty receivables and a higher gain of $0.3 billion related to the sale of certain investments in equity securities as compared to the prior year. This was partially offset by higher litigation expense of $0.4 billion, $0.3 billion of acquisition costs related to Actelion and AMO, an asset impairment charge of $0.2 billion primarily related to the insulin pump business and a higher restructuring related charge of $0.2 billion as compared to the fiscal year 2016. The change in other (income) expense, net for the fiscal year 2016 was an unfavorable change of $2.5 billion as compared to the prior year primarily due to higher gains on the sale of assets/businesses in the fiscal year 2015 as compared to 2016. The fiscal year of 2016 included gains of $0.6 billion from the divestitures of the controlled substance raw material and API business, certain anesthetic products in Europe and certain non-strategic Consumer brands versus gains of $2.6 billion recorded in 2015 primarily from the divestiture of the Cordis business, the U.S. divestiture of NUCYNTA  and the SPLENDA  brand. Additionally, the fiscal year of 2016 included higher litigation expense of $0.7 billion as compared to 2015. This was partially offset by a $0.3 billion intangible asset write-down related to Acclarent included in the fiscal year 2015. Interest (Income) Expense: Interest income in 2017 increased slightly as compared to 2016 due to higher average interest rates partially offset by lower cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities balances during the period. Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaled $18.3 billion at the end of 2017, and averaged $30.1 billion as compared to the $40.1 billion average cash balance in 2016. The decrease in the balance of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities was due to the use of cash for general corporate purposes including acquisitions, primarily the Actelion acquisition for $29.6 billion, net of cash acquired. Interest expense in 2017 was higher as compared to 2016. The average debt balance was $30.9 billion in 2017 versus $23.5 billion in 2016. The total debt balance at the end of 2017 was $34.6 billion as compared to $27.1 billion at the end of 2016. The higher debt balance of approximately $7.5 billion was primarily due to increased borrowings. The Company increased borrowings in February and November of 2017, capitalizing on favorable terms in the capital markets. The proceeds of the borrowings were used for general corporate purposes, including the completion of the stock repurchase program. Interest income in 2016 increased by $0.2 billion as compared to 2015 due to a higher average balance of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities and higher interest rates. Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaled $41.9 billion at the end of 2016, and averaged $40.1 billion as compared to the $35.7 billion average cash balance in 2015. Interest expense in 2016 was higher as compared to 2015. The average debt balance was $23.5 billion in 2016 versus $19.3 billion in 2015. The total debt balance at the end of 2016 was $27.1 billion as compared to $19.9 billion at the end of 2015. The higher debt balance of approximately $7.2 billion was primarily due to increased borrowings in February and May of 2016. The Company increased borrowings, capitalizing on favorable terms in the capital markets. The proceeds of the borrowings were used for general corporate purposes, primarily the stock repurchase program.  ##TABLE_START  ##TABLE_END Income Before Tax by Segment Income before tax by segment of business were as follows: ##TABLE_START   Income Before Tax  Segment Sales  Percent of Segment Sales (Dollars in Millions)       Consumer  $ 2,524  2,441  $ 13,602  13,307  18.6 %  18.3 Pharmaceutical  11,083  12,827  36,256  33,464  30.6  38.3 Medical Devices  5,392  5,578  26,592  25,119  20.3  22.2 Total (1)  18,999  20,846  76,450  71,890  24.9  29.0 Less: Expenses not allocated to segments (2)  1,326  1,043         Earnings before provision for taxes on income  $ 17,673  19,803  $ 76,450  71,890  23.1 %  27.5 ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (1)  See Note 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more details. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (2)  Amounts not allocated to segments include interest (income) expense and general corporate (income) expense. ##TABLE_END Increase in 2017 was primarily due to higher interest expense of $0.2 billion on higher debt balance.  Consumer Segment: In 2017, the Consumer segment income before tax as a percent to sales was 18.6%, versus 18.3% in 2016. The increase in the income before tax as a percent of sales in 2017 as compared to 2016 was attributable to higher gains on divestitures, primarily the divestiture of COMPEED  in 2017. This was partially offset by higher selling, marketing and administrative expenses as compared to the prior year due to increased advertising and promotional spending and slightly higher amortization expense in 2017 related to acquisitions. Additionally, the fiscal year 2016 was negatively impacted by operations in Venezuela. In 2016, the Consumer segment income before tax as a percent to sales was 18.3%, versus 13.2% in 2015, primarily driven by favorable selling, marketing and administrative expenses due to cost management and higher gross profit margins from cost improvement projects and favorable mix. This was partially offset by higher gains in 2015 related to divestitures, primarily the divestiture of the SPLENDA  brand. Additionally, operations in Venezuela negatively impacted the Consumer segment income before tax in 2016 as compared to 2015. Pharmaceutical Segment: In 2017, the Pharmaceutical segment income before tax as a percent to sales was 30.6% versus 38.3% in 2016. The decrease in the income before tax as a percent of sales was primarily due to $2.3 billion of higher amortization expense and other costs related to the Actelion acquisition, higher research and development expense, a higher IPRD charge of $0.4 billion related to Novira and lower gains on divestitures as compared to the prior year. Additionally, the fiscal year 2016 included a positive adjustment of $0.5 billion to previous reserve estimates. This was partially offset by a gain of $0.2 billion related to monetization of future royalty receivables, a higher gain of $0.2 billion related to the sale of certain investments in equity securities and favorable product mix in 2017. In 2016, the Pharmaceutical segment income before tax as a percent to sales was 38.3% versus 37.3% in 2015. The increase in income before tax was primarily due to strong sales volume growth and favorable selling, marketing and administrative expenses due to cost management. Additionally, the fiscal year 2015, had higher gains of $0.7 billion related to divestitures partially offset by a higher IPRD charge of $0.2 billion as compared to 2016. The fiscal year of 2016 included the gains from the divestitures of the controlled substance raw material and API business and certain anesthetic products in Europe versus the gains recorded in 2015 from the U.S. divestiture of NUCYNTA  . Medical Devices Segment: In 2017, the Medical Devices segment income before tax as a percent to sales was 20.3% versus 22.2% in 2016. The decrease in the income before tax as a percent to sales was primarily due to $0.3 billion of higher amortization expense and other acquisition costs related to AMO, $0.3 billion of higher litigation, an asset impairment charge of $0.2 billion primarily related to the insulin pump business, $0.1 billion of higher restructuring and investments in new product launches as compared to the fiscal year 2016. This was partially offset by $0.8 billion higher gains in 2017 related to divestitures, primarily the divestiture of Codman Neurosurgery. In 2016, the Medical Devices segment income before tax as a percent to sales was 22.2% versus 27.2% in 2015. The decrease in the income before tax as a percent to sales was primarily due to lower gains of $1.4 billion related to divestitures, higher litigation expense of $0.8 billion and a higher restructuring charge of $0.1 billion as compared to 2015. This was partially offset by an intangible asset write-down of $0.3 billion related to Acclarent in 2015 and favorable selling, marketing and administrative expenses in 2016.  ##TABLE_START  ##TABLE_END Restructuring: In the first quarter of 2016, the Company announced restructuring actions in its Medical Devices segment. The restructuring actions are expected to result in annualized pre-tax cost savings of $800 million to $1.0 billion, the majority of which is expected to be realized by the end of 2018. Approximately $500 million in savings were realized in 2017. The savings will provide the Company with added flexibility and resources to fund investment in new growth opportunities and innovative solutions for customers and patients. The Company estimates that, in connection with its plans, it will record pre-tax restructuring related charges of approximately $2.0 billion to $2.4 billion. In 2017, the Company recorded a pre-tax charge of $760 million, of which $88 million is included in cost of products sold and $363 million is included in other (income) expense. In 2016, the Company recorded a pre-tax charge of $685 million, of which $45 million is included in cost of products sold and $149 million is included in other (income) expense. In 2015, the Company recorded a pre-tax charge of $590 million, of which $81 million was included in cost of products sold. Restructuring related charges of $2.0 billion have been recorded since the restructuring was announced. See Note 22 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional details related to the restructuring. Provision for Taxes on Income: The worldwide effective income tax rate was 92.6% in 2017 , 16.5% in 2016 and 19.7% in 2015 . The 2017 effective tax rate increased by 76.1% as compared to 2016, primarily driven by the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) in the United States in December 2017. The enactment of the TCJA resulted in a provisional tax charge in the fourth quarter of 2017, of approximately $13.0 billion or approximately 73.3 percentage point increase to the effective tax rate. See Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional details related to the TCJA. The remainder of the increase in the tax rate for 2017 was related to the remeasurement of the Companys deferred tax assets in Belgium, as a result of changes in the Belgian statutory corporate tax rate, enacted in December 2017, offset by a tax benefit for the closure of the Companys Animas insulin pump business. The government in Switzerland is currently considering tax reform legislation, which could have a material impact on the Companys effective tax rate if enacted into law. The decrease in the 2016 effective tax rate, as compared to 2015 was primarily attributable to the Company adopting a new accounting standard for the reporting of additional tax benefits on share-based compensation that vested or were exercised during the fiscal year. The remainder of the change in the effective tax rate was primarily related to the lower earnings before taxes in the United States and the settlement of several uncertain tax positions in 2016 versus 2015. The decrease in the 2015 effective tax rate, as compared to 2014 was primarily attributable to the increases in taxable income in lower tax jurisdictions relative to higher tax jurisdictions and a tax benefit resulting from a restructuring of international affiliates. Liquidity and Capital Resources Liquidity  Cash Flows Cash and cash equivalents were $17.8 billion at the end of 2017 as compared to $19.0 billion at the end of 2016. The primary sources and uses of cash that contributed to the $1.2 billion decrease were approximately $21.1 billion of cash generated from operating activities and $0.3 billion due to the effect on exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents offset by $14.9 billion net cash used by investing activities and $7.7 billion net cash used by financing activities. In addition, the Company had $0.5 billion in marketable securities at the end of 2017 and $22.9 billion at the end of 2016. See Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional details on cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities. Cash flow from operations of $21.1 billion was the result of $1.3 billion of net earnings and $9.8 billion of non-cash expenses and other adjustments for depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation, assets write-downs and deferred tax provision, reduced by $1.3 billion from net gains on sale of assets/businesses and $1.0 billion related to an increase in accounts receivable and an increase in other current and non-current assets. Additional sources of operating cash flow of $12.3 billion resulted from an increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities, a decrease in inventories and an increase in other current and non-current liabilities. The increase in accrued liabilities and non-current liabilities is primarily due to the 2017 U.S. tax legislation (TCJA). The U.S. tax of $10.1 billion is payable over 8 years. Additionally, foreign taxes of $3.4 billion, net were recorded in the deferred tax provision. Investing activities use of $14.9 billion was for acquisitions, net of cash acquired of $35.2 billion (primarily the acquisitions of Actelion and AMO for approximately $29.6 billion and $4.3 billion, respectively) and additions to property, plant and equipment of $3.3 billion. This was partially offset by proceeds from the net sale of investments primarily marketable securities of $22.0 billion and $1.8 billion of proceeds from the disposal of assets/businesses (primarily the divestitures of Codman Neurosurgery and COMPEED  ). Financing activities use of $7.7 billion was primarily for dividends to shareholders of $8.9 billion, $6.4 billion for the repurchase of common stock and $0.2 billion of other financing. Financing activities also included sources of $6.8 billion from net proceeds of short and long-term debt and $1.1 billion of proceeds from stock options exercised/employee withholding tax on stock awards, net. On October 13, 2015, the Company announced that its Board of Directors approved a share repurchase program, authorizing the Company to purchase up to $10.0 billion of the Company's shares of common stock. As of July 2, 2017, $10.0 billion was repurchased under the program and the program was completed. Shares acquired are available for general corporate purposes.  ##TABLE_START  ##TABLE_END As of December 31, 2017, the Company's notes payable and long-term debt was in excess of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities. In 2017, the Company continued to have access to liquidity through the commercial paper market. Additionally, as a result of the TCJA, the Company has access to its cash outside the U.S. at a significantly reduced cost. The Company anticipates that operating cash flows, the ability to raise funds from external sources, borrowing capacity from existing committed credit facilities and access to the commercial paper markets will continue to provide sufficient resources to fund operating needs for the next twelve months. The Company monitors the global capital markets on an ongoing basis and from time to time may raise capital when market conditions are favorable. The Company filed a new shelf registration on February 27, 2017 which will enable it to issue debt securities on a timely basis. In the fiscal first and fourth quarters of 2017, the Company issued bonds for a total of $9.0 billion for general corporate purposes, including the completion of the stock repurchase program. For additional details on borrowings, see Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Financing and Market Risk The Company uses financial instruments to manage the impact of foreign exchange rate changes on cash flows. Accordingly, the Company enters into forward foreign exchange contracts to protect the value of certain foreign currency assets and liabilities and to hedge future foreign currency transactions primarily related to product costs. Gains or losses on these contracts are offset by the gains or losses on the underlying transactions. A 10% appreciation of the U.S. Dollar from the December 31, 2017 market rates would increase the unrealized value of the Companys forward contracts by $167 million. Conversely, a 10% depreciation of the U.S. Dollar from the December 31, 2017 market rates would decrease the unrealized value of the Companys forward contracts by $197 million. In either scenario, the gain or loss on the forward contract would be offset by the gain or loss on the underlying transaction, and therefore, would have no impact on future anticipated earnings and cash flows. The Company hedges the exposure to fluctuations in currency exchange rates, and the effect on certain assets and liabilities in foreign currency, by entering into currency swap contracts. A 1% change in the spread between U.S. and foreign interest rates on the Companys interest rate sensitive financial instruments would either increase or decrease the unrealized value of the Companys swap contracts by approximately $69 million. In either scenario, at maturity, the gain or loss on the swap contract would be offset by the gain or loss on the underlying transaction, and therefore, would have no impact on future anticipated cash flows. The Company does not enter into financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes. Further, the Company has a policy of only entering into contracts with parties that have at least an investment grade credit rating. The counter-parties to these contracts are major financial institutions and there is no significant concentration of exposure with any one counter-party. Management believes the risk of loss is remote. The Company invests in both fixed rate and floating rate interest earning securities which carry a degree of interest rate risk. The fair market value of fixed rate securities may be adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates, while floating rate securities may produce less income than predicted if interest rates fall. A 1% (100 basis points) change in spread on the Companys interest rate sensitive investments would either increase or decrease the unrealized value of cash equivalents and current marketable securities by approximately $8 million. The Company has access to substantial sources of funds at numerous banks worldwide. In September 2017, the Company secured a new 364-day Credit Facility. Total credit available to the Company approximates $10 billion, which expires on September 13, 2018. Interest charged on borrowings under the credit line agreement is based on either bids provided by banks, the prime rate or London Interbank Offered Rates (LIBOR), plus applicable margins. Commitment fees under the agreement are not material. Total borrowings at the end of 2017 and 2016 were $34.6 billion and $27.1 billion, respectively. The increase in borrowings between 2017 and 2016 was a result of financing for the Company's share repurchase program and general corporate purposes. In 2017, net debt (cash and current marketable securities, net of debt) was $16.3 billion compared to net cash of $14.8 billion in 2016. Total debt represented 36.5% of total capital (shareholders equity and total debt) in 2017 and 27.8% of total capital in 2016. Shareholders equity per share at the end of 2017 was $22.43 compared to $26.02 at year-end 2016 , a decrease of 13.8%. A summary of borrowings can be found in Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.  ##TABLE_START  ##TABLE_END Contractual Obligations and Commitments The Companys contractual obligations are primarily for the recently enacted tax legislation, leases, debt and unfunded retirement plans. There are no other significant obligations. To satisfy these obligations, the Company will use cash from operations. The following table summarizes the Companys contractual obligations and their aggregate maturities as of December 31, 2017 (see Notes 7, 8, 10 and 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further details): ##TABLE_START (Dollars in Millions)  Tax Legislation (TCJA)  Debt Obligations  Interest on Debt Obligations  Unfunded Retirement Plans  Operating Leases  Total  $ 1,614  1,499  1,002    4,430   2,752     4,781   1,105     3,032   1,797     3,650  1,513  2,189     4,682 After 2022  4,538  22,832  9,659    37,783 Total  $ 10,086  32,174  14,129  1,130   58,358 ##TABLE_ENDFor tax matters, see Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. For other retirement plan and post-employment medical benefit information, see Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The table does not include activity related to business combinations. Dividends The Company increased its dividend in 2017 for the 55th consecutive year. Cash dividends paid were $3.32 per share in 2017 compared with dividends of $3.15 per share in 2016 , and $2.95 per share in 2015 . The dividends were distributed as follows: ##TABLE_START    First quarter $ 0.80  0.75  0.70 Second quarter 0.84  0.80  0.75 Third quarter 0.84  0.80  0.75 Fourth quarter 0.84  0.80  0.75 Total $ 3.32  3.15  2.95 ##TABLE_ENDOn January 2, 2018, the Board of Directors declared a regular quarterly cash dividend of $0.84 per share, payable on March 13, 2018, to shareholders of record as of February 27, 2018. The Company expects to continue the practice of paying regular cash dividends.   ##TABLE_START  ##TABLE_END Other Information Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Managements discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition are based on the Companys consolidated financial statements that have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. (GAAP). The preparation of these financial statements requires that management make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported for revenues, expenses, assets, liabilities and other related disclosures. Actual results may or may not differ from these estimates. The Company believes that the understanding of certain key accounting policies and estimates are essential in achieving more insight into the Companys operating results and financial condition. These key accounting policies include revenue recognition, income taxes, legal and self-insurance contingencies, valuation of long-lived assets, assumptions used to determine the amounts recorded for pensions and other employee benefit plans and accounting for stock based awards. Revenue Recognition: The Company recognizes revenue from product sales when goods are shipped or delivered, and title and risk of loss pass to the customer. Provisions for certain rebates, sales incentives, trade promotions, coupons, product returns and discounts to customers are accounted for as reductions in sales in the same period the related sales are recorded. See Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for the Accounting Standards Update related to revenue which will be adopted in 2018. Product discounts granted are based on the terms of arrangements with direct, indirect and other market participants, as well as market conditions, including prices charged by competitors. Rebates, which include the Medicaid rebate provision, are estimated based on contractual terms, historical experience, patient outcomes, trend analysis and projected market conditions in the various markets served. The Company evaluates market conditions for products or groups of products primarily through the analysis of wholesaler and other third-party sell-through and market research data, as well as internally generated information. Sales returns are estimated and recorded based on historical sales and returns information. Products that exhibit unusual sales or return patterns due to dating, competition or other marketing matters are specifically investigated and analyzed as part of the accounting for sales return accruals. Sales returns allowances represent a reserve for products that may be returned due to expiration, destruction in the field, or in specific areas, product recall. The returns reserve is based on historical return trends by product and by market as a percent to gross sales. In accordance with the Companys accounting policies, the Company generally issues credit to customers for returned goods. The Companys sales returns reserves are accounted for in accordance with the U.S. GAAP guidance for revenue recognition when right of return exists. Sales returns reserves are recorded at full sales value. Sales returns in the Consumer and Pharmaceutical segments are almost exclusively not resalable. Sales returns for certain franchises in the Medical Devices segment are typically resalable but are not material. The Company infrequently exchanges products from inventory for returned products. The sales returns reserve for the total Company has been approximately 1.0% of annual net trade sales during the fiscal reporting years 2017 , 2016 and 2015 . Promotional programs, such as product listing allowances and cooperative advertising arrangements, are recorded in the year incurred. Continuing promotional programs include coupons and volume-based sales incentive programs. The redemption cost of consumer coupons is based on historical redemption experience by product and value. Volume-based incentive programs are based on estimated sales volumes for the incentive period and are recorded as products are sold. The Company also earns service revenue for co-promotion of certain products. For all years presented, service revenues were approximately 1% or less of the total revenues and are included in sales to customers. These arrangements are evaluated to determine the appropriate amounts to be deferred or recorded as a reduction of revenue. In addition, the Company enters into collaboration arrangements that contain multiple revenue generating activities. Amounts due from collaborative partners for these arrangements are recognized as each activity is performed or delivered, based on the relative selling price. Upfront fees received as part of these arrangements are deferred and recognized over the performance period. See Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional disclosures on collaborations. Reasonably likely changes to assumptions used to calculate the accruals for rebates, returns and promotions are not anticipated to have a material effect on the financial statements. The Company currently discloses the impact of changes to assumptions in the quarterly or annual filing in which there is a material financial statement impact.  ##TABLE_START  ##TABLE_END Below are tables that show the progression of accrued rebates, returns, promotions, reserve for doubtful accounts and reserve for cash discounts by segment of business for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2017 and January 1, 2017 .

The Company estimates deferred tax assets and liabilities based on enacted tax regulations and rates. Future changes in tax laws and rates may affect recorded deferred tax assets and liabilities. The Company has unrecognized tax benefits for uncertain tax positions. The Company follows U.S. GAAP, which prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. Management believes that changes in these estimates would not have a material effect on the Company's results of operations, cash flows or financial position. In the fourth quarter of 2017, the United States enacted the TCJA, which includes provisions for a tax on all previously undistributed earnings in foreign jurisdictions. The Company has provisionally booked a $10.1 billion charge on these undistributed earnings in 2017. Additionally, the Company has provisionally recorded a $4.5 billion deferred tax liability for foreign local and withholding taxes, offset by a $1.1 billion deferred tax asset for U.S. foreign tax credits, for repatriation of substantially all undistributed foreign earnings. The Company is currently evaluating the remaining undistributed foreign earnings for which it has not provided deferred taxes for foreign local and withholding tax, as these earnings are considered to be indefinitely reinvested. The amount of these unrecorded deferred taxes is not expected to be material. See Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding income taxes. Legal and Self Insurance Contingencies:  The Company records accruals for various contingencies, including legal proceedings and product liability claims as these arise in the normal course of business. The accruals are based on managements judgment as to the probability of losses and, where applicable, actuarially determined estimates. The Company has self insurance through a wholly-owned captive insurance company. In addition to accruals in the self insurance program, claims that exceed the insurance coverage are accrued when losses are probable and amounts can be reasonably estimated. The Company follows the provisions of U.S. GAAP when recording litigation related contingencies. A liability is recorded when a loss is probable and can be reasonably estimated. The best estimate of a loss within a range is accrued; however, if no estimate in the range is better than any other, the minimum amount is accrued. See Notes 1 and 21 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding product liability and legal proceedings.  ##TABLE_START  ##TABLE_END Long-Lived and Intangible Assets: The Company assesses changes in economic conditions and makes assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows in evaluating the value of the Companys property, plant and equipment, goodwill and intangible assets. As these assumptions and estimates may change over time, it may or may not be necessary for the Company to record impairment charges. Employee Benefit Plans: The Company sponsors various retirement and pension plans, including defined benefit, defined contribution and termination indemnity plans, which cover most employees worldwide. These plans are based on assumptions for the discount rate, expected return on plan assets, mortality rates, expected salary increases, health care cost trend rates and attrition rates. See Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further details on these rates and the effect a rate change to the health care cost trend would have on the Companys results of operations. Stock Based Compensation: The Company recognizes compensation expense associated with the issuance of equity instruments to employees for their services. Based on the type of equity instrument, the fair value is estimated on the date of grant using either the Black-Scholes option valuation model or a combination of both the Black-Scholes option valuation model and Monte Carlo valuation model, and is expensed in the financial statements over the service period. The input assumptions used in determining fair value are the expected life, expected volatility, risk-free rate and expected dividend yield. For performance share units the fair market value is calculated for each of the three component goals at the date of grant. The fair values for the sales and earnings per share goals of each performance share unit were estimated on the date of grant using the fair market value of the shares at the time of the award, discounted for dividends, which are not paid on the performance share units during the vesting period. The fair value for the relative total shareholder return goal of each performance share unit was estimated on the date of grant using the Monte Carlo valuation model. See Note 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. New Accounting Pronouncements Refer to Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for recently adopted accounting pronouncements and recently issued accounting pronouncements not yet adopted as of December 31, 2017 . Economic and Market Factors The Company is aware that its products are used in an environment where, for more than a decade, policymakers, consumers and businesses have expressed concerns about the rising cost of health care. In response to these concerns, the Company has a long-standing policy of pricing products responsibly. For the period 2007 - 2017, in the United States, the weighted average compound annual growth rate of the Companys net price increases for health care products (prescription and over-the-counter drugs, hospital and professional products) was below the U.S. Consumer Price Index (CPI). The Company operates in certain countries where the economic conditions continue to present significant challenges. The Company continues to monitor these situations and take appropriate actions. Inflation rates continue to have an effect on worldwide economies and, consequently, on the way companies operate. The Company has accounted for operations in Venezuela as highly inflationary, as the prior three-year cumulative inflation rate surpassed 100%. In the face of increasing costs, the Company strives to maintain its profit margins through cost reduction programs, productivity improvements and periodic price increases. In June 2016, the United Kingdom (U.K.) held a referendum in which voters approved an exit from the European Union (E.U.), commonly referred to as Brexit and in March 2017 the U.K. formally started the process for the U.K. to leave the E.U. Given the lack of comparable precedent, it is unclear what financial, trade, regulatory and legal implications the withdrawal of the U.K. from the E.U. will have. Brexit creates global political and economic uncertainty, which may cause, among other consequences, volatility in exchange rates and interest rates, additional cost containment by third-party payors and changes in regulations. However, the Company currently does not believe that these and other related effects will have a material impact on the Companys consolidated financial position or operating results. As of December 31, 2017, the business of the Companys U.K. subsidiaries represented less than 3% of both the Companys consolidated assets and fiscal twelve  months revenues, respectively. The Company is exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates. A 1% change in the value of the U.S. Dollar as compared to all foreign currencies in which the Company had sales, income or expense in 2017 would have increased or decreased the translation of foreign sales by approximately $360 million and income by $105 million. Governments around the world consider various proposals to make changes to tax laws, which may include increasing or decreasing existing statutory tax rates. A change in statutory tax rate in any country would result in the revaluation of the Companys deferred tax assets and liabilities related to that particular jurisdiction in the period in which the new tax law is enacted. This change would result in an expense or benefit recorded to the Companys Consolidated Statement of Earnings. The Company closely monitors these proposals as they arise in the countries where it operates. Changes to the statutory tax rate may occur at any time, and any related expense or benefit recorded may be material to the fiscal quarter and year in which the law change is enacted.  ##TABLE_START  ##TABLE_END The Company faces various worldwide health care changes that may continue to result in pricing pressures that include health care cost containment and government legislation relating to sales, promotions and reimbursement of health care products. Changes in the behavior and spending patterns of purchasers of health care products and services, including delaying medical procedures, rationing prescription medications, reducing the frequency of physician visits and foregoing health care insurance coverage, as a result of the current global economic downturn, may continue to impact the Companys businesses. The Company also operates in an environment increasingly hostile to intellectual property rights. Firms have filed Abbreviated New Drug Applications or Biosimilar Biological Product Applications with the FDA or otherwise challenged the coverage and/or validity of the Company's patents, seeking to market generic or biosimilar forms of many of the Companys key pharmaceutical products prior to expiration of the applicable patents covering those products. In the event the Company is not successful in defending the patent claims challenged in the resulting lawsuits, generic or biosimilar versions of the products at issue will be introduced to the market, resulting in the potential for substantial market share and revenue losses for those products, and which may result in a non-cash impairment charge in any associated intangible asset. There is also a risk that one or more competitors could launch a generic or biosimilar version of the product at issue following regulatory approval even though one or more valid patents are in place. For further information, see the discussion on REMICADE  Related Cases and Litigation Against Filers of Abbreviated New Drug Applications in Note 21 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Legal Proceedings Johnson  Johnson and certain of its subsidiaries are involved in various lawsuits and claims regarding product liability, intellectual property, commercial and other matters; governmental investigations; and other legal proceedings that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of business. The Company records accruals for loss contingencies associated with these legal matters when it is probable that a liability will be incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. The Company has accrued for certain litigation matters and continues to monitor each related legal issue and adjust accruals for new information and further developments in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 450-20-25. For these and other litigation and regulatory matters currently disclosed for which a loss is probable or reasonably possible, the Company is unable to estimate the possible loss or range of loss beyond the amounts already accrued. Amounts accrued for legal contingencies often result from a complex series of judgments about future events and uncertainties that rely heavily on estimates and assumptions. The ability to make such estimates and judgments can be affected by various factors, including whether damages sought in the proceedings are unsubstantiated or indeterminate; scientific and legal discovery has not commenced or is not complete; proceedings are in early stages; matters present legal uncertainties; there are significant facts in dispute; or there are numerous parties involved. In the Company's opinion, based on its examination of these matters, its experience to date and discussions with counsel, the ultimate outcome of legal proceedings, net of liabilities accrued in the Company's balance sheet, is not expected to have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial position. However, the resolution of, or increase in accruals for, one or more of these matters in any reporting period may have a material adverse effect on the Company's results of operations and cash flows for that period. See Note 21 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding legal proceedings.

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies ##TABLE_END Principles of Consolidation The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Johnson  Johnson and its subsidiaries (the Company). Intercompany accounts and transactions are eliminated. Description of the Company and Business Segments The Company has approximately 134,000 employees worldwide engaged in the research and development, manufacture and sale of a broad range of products in the health care field. The Company conducts business in virtually all countries of the world and its primary focus is on products related to human health and well-being. The Company is organized into three business segments: Consumer, Pharmaceutical and Medical Devices. The Consumer segment includes a broad range of products used in the baby care, oral care, beauty, over-the-counter pharmaceutical, womens health and wound care markets. These products are marketed to the general public and sold both to retail outlets and distributors throughout the world. The Pharmaceutical segment is focused on six therapeutic areas, including immunology, infectious diseases, neuroscience, oncology, pulmonary hypertension, and cardiovascular and metabolic diseases. Products in this segment are distributed directly to retailers, wholesalers, hospitals and health care professionals for prescription use. The Medical Devices segment includes a broad range of products used in the orthopaedic, surgery, cardiovascular, diabetes care and vision care fields, which are distributed to wholesalers, hospitals and retailers, and used principally in the professional fields by physicians, nurses, hospitals, eye care professionals and clinics. Accounting Standard adopted in 2016 During the fiscal second quarter of 2016, the Company adopted Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2016-09 Compensation - Stock Compensation: Improvements to Employee Share Based Payment Accounting for the reporting of additional tax benefits on share-based compensation that vested or were exercised during the fiscal year. The update requires all excess tax benefits and deficiencies to be recognized as a reduction or an increase to the provision for taxes on income. Previously, the Company recorded these benefits directly to Retained Earnings. The tax benefit for the Company was $353 million for the fiscal year 2016. The standard does not permit retroactive presentation of this benefit to prior fiscal years on the Consolidated Statement of Earnings. New Accounting Standards Recently Adopted Accounting Standards ASU 2016-07: Simplifying the Transition to the Equity Method of Accounting The amendments in the update eliminate the requirement that when an investment qualifies for the use of the equity method as a result of an increase in the level of ownership interest or degree of influence, an investor must adjust the investment, results of operations, and retained earnings retroactively on a step by step basis as if the equity method had been in effect during all previous periods that the investment had been held. The amendments in this update are effective for all entities for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2016. The amendments should be applied prospectively upon their effective date to increases in the level of ownership interest or degree of influence that result in the application of the equity method. The adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on the presentation of the Company's consolidated financial statements. ASU 2015-11: Simplifying the Measurement of Inventory This update requires inventory to be measured at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Net realizable value is the estimated selling prices in the ordinary course of business, less reasonably predictable costs of completion, disposal and transportation. This update is effective for the Company for all annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2016. The amendments in this update should be applied prospectively. This update did not have any material impact on the Companys consolidated financial statements. Recently Issued Accounting Standards Not Adopted as of December 31, 2017 ASU 2018-02: Reclassification of Certain Tax Effects from Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income This update allows a reclassification from accumulated other comprehensive income to retained earnings for stranded tax effects resulting from the Tax Cuts and Job Act enacted in December 2017. This update will be effective for the Company for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018 and interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted. The Company does not expect this standard to have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements.  ##TABLE_START  ##TABLE_END ASU 2017-12: Targeted Improvements to Accounting for Hedging Activities This update makes more financial and nonfinancial hedging strategies eligible for hedge accounting. It also amends the presentation and disclosure requirements and changes how companies assess effectiveness. This update will be effective for the Company for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, and interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted upon its issuance. The Company is currently assessing the impact of the future adoption of this standard on its financial statements. ASU 2017-07: Improving the Presentation of Net Periodic Pension Cost and Net Periodic Postretirement Benefit Cost This update requires that an employer disaggregate the service cost component from the other components of net periodic benefit cost (NPBC). In addition, only the service cost component will be eligible for capitalization. This update is effective for the Company for all annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2017. Early adoption is permitted as of the beginning of an annual period for which financial statements (interim or annual) have not been issued or made available for issuance. The amendments in this Update should be applied retrospectively for the presentation of the service cost component and the other components of NPBC in the income statement and prospectively, on and after the effective date, for the capitalization of the service cost component of NPBC in assets. The Company is assessing the retroactive restatement methodology and impact to the individual line items on Consolidated Statement of Earnings. The Company does not expect there to be a material impact to net earnings. ASU 2017-01: Clarifying the Definition of a Business This update narrows the definition of a business by providing a screen to determine when an integrated set of assets and activities is not a business. The screen specifies that an integrated set of assets and activities is not a business if substantially all of the fair value of the gross assets acquired or disposed of is concentrated in a single or a group of similar identifiable assets. This update will be effective for the Company for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within those annual periods. Early adoption is permitted. This update should be applied prospectively. The Company does not expect this standard to have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements. ASU 2016-16: Income Taxes: Intra-Entity Transfers of Assets Other Than Inventory This update removes the current exception in US GAAP prohibiting entities from recognizing current and deferred income tax expenses or benefits related to transfer of assets, other than inventory, within the consolidated entity. The current exception to defer the recognition of any tax impact on the transfer of inventory within the consolidated entity until it is sold to a third party remains unaffected. The amendments in this update are effective for public entities for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017. The results from a preliminary assessment indicate that the adoption of the standard will not have a significant impact on the Companys financial results. The Company expects to record net adjustments to deferred taxes of approximately $2.0 billion , a decrease to Other Assets of approximately $0.7 billion and an increase to retained earnings of approximately $1.3 billion . ASU 2016-02: Leases This update requires the recognition of lease assets and lease liabilities on the balance sheet for all lease obligations and disclosing key information about leasing arrangements. This update requires the recognition of lease assets and lease liabilities by lessees for those leases classified as operating leases under current generally accepted accounting principles. This update will be effective for the Company for all annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early application is permitted. The Company anticipates that most of its operating leases will result in the recognition of additional assets and the corresponding liabilities on its Consolidated Balance Sheets, however does not expect the standard to have a material impact on the financial position. The actual impact will depend on the Company's lease portfolio at the time of adoption. The Company continues to assess all implications of the standard and related financial disclosures. ASU 2016-01: Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities The amendments in this update supersede the guidance to classify equity securities with readily determinable fair values into different categories (that is, trading or available-for-sale) and require equity securities to be measured at fair value with changes in the fair value recognized through net income. The standard amends financial reporting by providing relevant information about an entitys equity investments and reducing the number of items that are recognized in other comprehensive income. This update will be effective for the Company for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods within those annual periods. The adoption of this standard will not have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements. ASU 2014-09: Revenue from Contracts with Customers The amendments replace substantially all current U.S. GAAP guidance on this topic and eliminate industry-specific guidance. Early adoption of this standard is permitted but not before the original effective date for all annual periods and interim reporting  ##TABLE_START  ##TABLE_END periods beginning after December 15, 2017. The Company will adopt the standard using the modified retrospective method. The adoption of this standard will not have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements including the additional disclosure requirements. Cash Equivalents The Company classifies all highly liquid investments with stated maturities of three months or less from date of purchase as cash equivalents and all highly liquid investments with stated maturities of greater than three months from the date of purchase as current marketable securities. The Company has a policy of making investments only with commercial institutions that have at least an investment grade credit rating. The Company invests its cash primarily in government securities and obligations, corporate debt securities, money market funds and reverse repurchase agreements (RRAs). RRAs are collateralized by deposits in the form of Government Securities and Obligations for an amount not less than 102% of their value. The Company does not record an asset or liability as the Company is not permitted to sell or repledge the associated collateral. The Company has a policy that the collateral has at least an A (or equivalent) credit rating. The Company utilizes a third party custodian to manage the exchange of funds and ensure that collateral received is maintained at 102% of the value of the RRAs on a daily basis. RRAs with stated maturities of greater than three months from the date of purchase are classified as marketable securities. Investments Investments classified as held to maturity investments are reported at amortized cost and realized gains or losses are reported in earnings. Investments classified as available-for-sale are carried at estimated fair value with unrealized gains and losses recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income. Available-for-sale securities available for current operations are classified as current assets otherwise, they are classified as long term. Management determines the appropriate classification of its investment in debt and equity securities at the time of purchase and re-evaluates such determination at each balance sheet date. The Company periodically reviews its investments in equity securities for impairment and adjusts these investments to their fair value when a decline in market value is deemed to be other than temporary. If losses on these securities are considered to be other than temporary, the loss is recognized in earnings. Property, Plant and Equipment and Depreciation Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost. The Company utilizes the straight-line method of depreciation over the estimated useful lives of the assets: ##TABLE_START Building and building equipment 20 - 30 years Land and leasehold improvements 10 - 20 years Machinery and equipment 2 - 13 years ##TABLE_ENDThe Company capitalizes certain computer software and development costs, included in machinery and equipment, when incurred in connection with developing or obtaining computer software for internal use. Capitalized software costs are amortized over the estimated useful lives of the software, which generally range from 3 to 8 years. The Company reviews long-lived assets to assess recoverability using undiscounted cash flows. When certain events or changes in operating or economic conditions occur, an impairment assessment may be performed on the recoverability of the carrying value of these assets. If the asset is determined to be impaired, the loss is measured based on the difference between the assets fair value and its carrying value. If quoted market prices are not available, the Company will estimate fair value using a discounted value of estimated future cash flows. Revenue Recognition The Company recognizes revenue from product sales when the goods are shipped or delivered and title and risk of loss pass to the customer. Provisions for certain rebates, sales incentives, trade promotions, coupons, product returns and discounts to customers are accounted for as reductions in sales in the same period the related sales are recorded. Product discounts granted are based on the terms of arrangements with direct, indirect and other market participants, as well as market conditions, including prices charged by competitors. Rebates, which include Medicaid, are estimated based on contractual terms, historical experience, patient outcomes, trend analysis and projected market conditions in the various markets served. The Company evaluates market conditions for products or groups of products primarily through the analysis of wholesaler and other third-party sell-through and market research data, as well as internally generated information. Sales returns are generally estimated and recorded based on historical sales and returns information. Products that exhibit unusual sales or return patterns due to dating, competition or other marketing matters are specifically investigated and analyzed as part of the accounting for sales returns accruals. Sales returns allowances represent a reserve for products that may be returned due to expiration, destruction in the field, or in specific areas, product recall. The returns reserve is based on historical return trends by product and by market as a percent to gross sales. In accordance with the Companys accounting policies, the Company generally issues credit to customers for  ##TABLE_START  ##TABLE_END returned goods. The Companys sales returns reserves are accounted for in accordance with U.S. GAAP guidance for revenue recognition when right of return exists. Sales returns reserves are recorded at full sales value. Sales returns in the Consumer and Pharmaceutical segments are almost exclusively not resalable. Sales returns for certain franchises in the Medical Devices segment are typically resalable but are not material. The Company infrequently exchanges products from inventory for returned products. The sales returns reserve for the total Company has been approximately 1.0% of annual sales to customers during the fiscal reporting years 2017 , 2016 and 2015 . Promotional programs, such as product listing allowances and cooperative advertising arrangements, are recorded in the year incurred. Continuing promotional programs include coupons and volume-based sales incentive programs. The redemption cost of consumer coupons is based on historical redemption experience by product and value. Volume-based incentive programs are based on the estimated sales volumes for the incentive period and are recorded as products are sold. The Company also earns service revenue for co-promotion of certain products and includes it in sales to customers. These arrangements are evaluated to determine the appropriate amounts to be deferred or recorded as a reduction of revenue. Shipping and Handling Shipping and handling costs incurred were $1,042 million , $974 million and $996 million in 2017 , 2016 and 2015 , respectively, and are included in selling, marketing and administrative expense. The amount of revenue received for shipping and handling is less than 0.5% of sales to customers for all periods presented. Inventories Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value determined by the first-in, first-out method. Intangible Assets and Goodwill The authoritative literature on U.S. GAAP requires that goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives be assessed annually for impairment. The Company completed the annual impairment test for 2017 in the fiscal fourth quarter. Future impairment tests will be performed annually in the fiscal fourth quarter, or sooner if warranted. Purchased in-process research and development is accounted for as an indefinite lived intangible asset until the underlying project is completed, at which point the intangible asset will be accounted for as a definite lived intangible asset, or abandoned, at which point the intangible asset will be written off or partially impaired. Intangible assets that have finite useful lives continue to be amortized over their useful lives, and are reviewed for impairment when warranted by economic conditions. See Note 5 for further details on Intangible Assets and Goodwill. Financial Instruments As required by U.S. GAAP, all derivative instruments are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value. Fair value is the exit price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability. Fair value is a market-based measurement determined using assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability. The authoritative literature establishes a three-level hierarchy to prioritize the inputs used in measuring fair value, with Level 1 having the highest priority and Level 3 having the lowest. Changes in the fair value of derivatives are recorded each period in current earnings or other comprehensive income, depending on whether the derivative is designated as part of a hedge transaction, and if so, the type of hedge transaction. The Company documents all relationships between hedged items and derivatives. The overall risk management strategy includes reasons for undertaking hedge transactions and entering into derivatives. The objectives of this strategy are: (1) minimize foreign currency exposures impact on the Companys financial performance; (2) protect the Companys cash flow from adverse movements in foreign exchange rates; (3) ensure the appropriateness of financial instruments; and (4) manage the enterprise risk associated with financial institutions. See Note 6 for additional information on Financial Instruments. Product Liability Accruals for product liability claims are recorded, on an undiscounted basis, when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the liability can be reasonably estimated based on existing information and actuarially determined estimates where applicable. The accruals are adjusted periodically as additional information becomes available. The Company accrues an estimate of the legal defense costs needed to defend each matter when those costs are probable and can be reasonably estimated. As a result of cost and availability factors, effective November 1, 2005, the Company ceased purchasing third-party product liability insurance. The Company has self insurance through a wholly-owned captive insurance company. In addition to accruals in the self insurance program, claims that exceed the insurance coverage are accrued when losses are probable and amounts can be reasonably estimated. Research and Development Research and development expenses are expensed as incurred. Upfront and milestone payments made to third parties in connection with research and development collaborations are expensed as incurred up to the point of regulatory approval.  ##TABLE_START  ##TABLE_END Payments made to third parties subsequent to regulatory approval are capitalized and amortized over the remaining useful life of the related product. Amounts capitalized for such payments are included in other intangibles, net of accumulated amortization. The Company enters into collaborative arrangements, typically with other pharmaceutical or biotechnology companies, to develop and commercialize drug candidates or intellectual property. These arrangements typically involve two (or more) parties who are active participants in the collaboration and are exposed to significant risks and rewards dependent on the commercial success of the activities. These collaborations usually involve various activities by one or more parties, including research and development, marketing and selling and distribution. Often, these collaborations require upfront, milestone and royalty or profit share payments, contingent upon the occurrence of certain future events linked to the success of the asset in development. Amounts due from collaborative partners related to development activities are generally reflected as a reduction of research and development expense because the performance of contract development services is not central to the Companys operations. In general, the income statement presentation for these collaborations is as follows: ##TABLE_START Nature/Type of Collaboration  Statement of Earnings Presentation Third-party sale of product  Sales to customers Royalties/milestones paid to collaborative partner (post-regulatory approval)*  Cost of products sold Royalties received from collaborative partner  Other income (expense), net Upfront payments  milestones paid to collaborative partner (pre-regulatory approval)  Research and development expense Research and development payments to collaborative partner  Research and development expense Research and development payments received from collaborative partner  Reduction of Research and development expense ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START * Milestones are capitalized as intangible assets and amortized to cost of products sold over the useful life. ##TABLE_ENDFor all years presented, there was no individual project that represented greater than 5% of the total annual consolidated research and development expense. The Company has a number of products and compounds developed in collaboration with strategic partners including XARELTO  , co-developed with Bayer HealthCare AG and IMBRUVICA  , developed in collaboration and co-marketed with Pharmacyclics LLC, an AbbVie company.  Advertising Costs associated with advertising are expensed in the year incurred and are included in selling, marketing and administrative expenses. Advertising expenses worldwide, which comprised television, radio, print media and Internet advertising, were $2.5 billion , $2.4 billion and $2.5 billion in 2017 , 2016 and 2015 , respectively. Income Taxes Income taxes are recorded based on amounts refundable or payable for the current year and include the results of any difference between U.S. GAAP accounting and tax reporting, recorded as deferred tax assets or liabilities. The Company estimates deferred tax assets and liabilities based on enacted tax regulations and rates. Future changes in tax laws and rates may affect recorded deferred tax assets and liabilities in the future. The Company has unrecognized tax benefits for uncertain tax positions. The Company follows U.S. GAAP which prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. Management believes that changes in these estimates would not have a material effect on the Company's results of operations, cash flows or financial position. In the fourth quarter of 2017, the United States enacted the TCJA, which includes provisions for a tax on all previously undistributed earnings in foreign jurisdictions. The Company has provisionally booked a $10.1 billion charge on these undistributed earnings in 2017. Additionally, the Company has provisionally recorded a $4.5 billion deferred tax liability for foreign local and withholding taxes, offset by a $1.1 billion deferred tax asset for U.S. foreign tax credits, for repatriation of substantially all undistributed foreign earnings. The Company is currently evaluating the remaining undistributed foreign earnings for which it has not provided deferred taxes for foreign local and withholding tax, as these earnings are considered to be indefinitely reinvested. The amount of these unrecorded deferred taxes is not expected to be material. See Note 8 for further information regarding income taxes.  ##TABLE_START  ##TABLE_END Net Earnings Per Share Basic earnings per share is computed by dividing net earnings available to common shareholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the period. Diluted earnings per share reflects the potential dilution that could occur if securities were exercised or converted into common stock using the treasury stock method. Use of Estimates The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported. Estimates are used when accounting for sales discounts, rebates, allowances and incentives, product liabilities, income taxes, withholding taxes, depreciation, amortization, employee benefits, contingencies and intangible asset and liability valuations. Actual results may or may not differ from those estimates. The Company follows the provisions of U.S. GAAP when recording litigation related contingencies. A liability is recorded when a loss is probable and can be reasonably estimated. The best estimate of a loss within a range is accrued; however, if no estimate in the range is better than any other, the minimum amount is accrued. Annual Closing Date The Company follows the concept of a fiscal year, which ends on the Sunday nearest to the end of the month of December. Normally each fiscal year consists of 52 weeks, but every five or six years the fiscal year consists of 53 weeks , and therefore includes additional shipping days, as was the case in 2015, and will be the case again in 2020. Reclassification Certain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to current year presentation. ##TABLE_START 2.

Interest expense capitalized in 2017 , 2016 and 2015 was $94 million , $102 million and $102 million , respectively. Depreciation expense, including the amortization of capitalized interest in 2017 , 2016 and 2015 was $2.6 billion , $2.5 billion and $2.5 billion , respectively. Upon retirement or other disposal of property, plant and equipment, the costs and related amounts of accumulated depreciation or amortization are eliminated from the asset and accumulated depreciation accounts, respectively. The difference, if any, between the net asset value and the proceeds are recorded in earnings. ##TABLE_START 5. Intangible Assets and Goodwill ##TABLE_END At the end of 2017 and 2016 , the gross and net amounts of intangible assets were: ##TABLE_START (Dollars in Millions)   Intangible assets with definite lives:     Patents and trademarks  gross  $ 36,427  10,521 Less accumulated amortization  7,223  5,076 Patents and trademarks  net  $ 29,204  5,445 Customer relationships and other intangibles  gross  $ 20,204  17,615 Less accumulated amortization  7,463  6,515 Customer relationships and other intangibles  net  $ 12,741  11,100 Intangible assets with indefinite lives:     Trademarks  $ 7,082  6,888 Purchased in-process research and development  4,201  3,443 Total intangible assets with indefinite lives  $ 11,283  10,331 Total intangible assets  net  $ 53,228  26,876 ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  ##TABLE_END Goodwill as of December 31, 2017 and January 1, 2017 , as allocated by segment of business, was as follows: ##TABLE_START (Dollars in Millions)  Consumer  Pharmaceutical  Medical Devices  Total Goodwill at January 3, 2016  $ 7,240  2,889  11,500  21,629 Goodwill, related to acquisitions  1,362     1,572 Goodwill, related to divestitures  (63 )  (12 )    (75 ) Currency translation/other  (276 )  (37 )  (8 )  (321 ) Goodwill at January 1, 2017  $ 8,263  2,840  11,702  22,805 Goodwill, related to acquisitions   6,161  2,200  8,463 Goodwill, related to divestitures  (74 )  (1 )  (102 )  (177 ) Currency translation/other     Goodwill at December 31, 2017  $ 8,875  9,109  13,922  31,906 ##TABLE_ENDThe weighted average amortization periods for patents and trademarks and customer relationships and other intangible assets are 12 years and 23 years , respectively. The amortization expense of amortizable assets included in cost of products sold was $3.0 billion , $1.2 billion and $1.2 billion before tax, for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2017 , January 1, 2017 and January 3, 2016 , respectively. The estimated amortization expense for the five succeeding years approximates $4.4 billion before tax, per year. Intangible asset write-downs are included in Other (income) expense, net. The primary driver of the increase to intangible assets and goodwill is related to the Actelion acquisition in the fiscal second quarter of 2017, which resulted in the recording of $25.0 billion to intangible assets and $6.2 billion to goodwill. The intangible assets and goodwill amounts related to the Actelion acquisition are based on the preliminary purchase price allocation. Additionally, the Abbott Medical Optics (AMO) acquisition in the fiscal first quarter of 2017, resulted in the recording of $2.3 billion to intangible assets and $1.7 billion to goodwill. The intangible assets and goodwill amounts related to the AMO acquisition are based on the final purchase price allocation. See Note 20 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional details related to acquisitions and divestitures. ##TABLE_START 6. Fair Value Measurements ##TABLE_END The Company uses forward foreign exchange contracts to manage its exposure to the variability of cash flows, primarily related to the foreign exchange rate changes of future intercompany products and third-party purchases of materials denominated in a foreign currency. The Company uses cross currency interest rate swaps to manage currency risk primarily related to borrowings. The Company also uses equity collar contracts to manage exposure to market risk associated with certain equity investments. All three types of derivatives are designated as cash flow hedges. Additionally, the Company uses interest rate swaps as an instrument to manage interest rate risk related to fixed rate borrowings. These derivatives are designated as fair value hedges. The Company uses forward foreign exchange contracts designated as net investment hedges. Additionally, the Company uses forward foreign exchange contracts to offset its exposure to certain foreign currency assets and liabilities. These forward foreign exchange contracts are not designated as hedges and therefore, changes in the fair values of these derivatives are recognized in earnings, thereby offsetting the current earnings effect of the related foreign currency assets and liabilities. The Company does not enter into derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes, or that contain credit risk related contingent features. During the fiscal second quarter of 2017, the Company entered into credit support agreements (CSA) with certain derivative counterparties establishing collateral thresholds based on respective credit ratings and netting agreements. As of December 31, 2017 , the total amount of collateral paid under the credit support agreements (CSA) amounted to $162 million net. For equity collar contracts, the Company pledged the underlying hedged marketable equity securities to the counter-party as collateral. On an ongoing basis, the Company monitors counter-party credit ratings. The Company considers credit non-performance risk to be low, because the Company primarily enters into agreements with commercial institutions that have at least an investment grade credit rating. Refer to the table on significant financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value contained in this footnote for receivables and payables with these commercial institutions. As of December 31, 2017 , the Company had notional amounts outstanding for forward foreign exchange contracts, cross currency interest rate swaps and interest rate swaps of $34.5 billion , $2.3 billion , and $1.1 billion respectively. As of January 1, 2017, the Company had notional amounts outstanding for forward foreign exchange contracts, cross currency interest rate swaps, interest rate swaps and equity collar contracts of $36.0 billion , $2.3 billion , $1.8 billion , and $0.3 billion respectively.  ##TABLE_START  ##TABLE_END All derivative instruments are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value. Changes in the fair value of derivatives are recorded each period in current earnings or other comprehensive income, depending on whether the derivative is designated as part of a hedge transaction, and if so, the type of hedge transaction. The designation as a cash flow hedge is made at the entrance date of the derivative contract. At inception, all derivatives are expected to be highly effective. Changes in the fair value of a derivative that is designated as a cash flow hedge and is highly effective are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income until the underlying transaction affects earnings, and are then reclassified to earnings in the same account as the hedged transaction. Gains and losses associated with interest rate swaps and changes in fair value of hedged debt attributable to changes in interest rates are recorded to interest expense in the period in which they occur. Gains and losses on net investment hedges are accounted for through the currency translation account. On an ongoing basis, the Company assesses whether each derivative continues to be highly effective in offsetting changes of hedged items. If and when a derivative is no longer expected to be highly effective, hedge accounting is discontinued. Hedge ineffectiveness, if any, is included in current period earnings in Other (income) expense, net for forward foreign exchange contracts, cross currency interest rate swaps, net investment hedges and equity collar contracts. For interest rate swaps designated as fair value hedges, hedge ineffectiveness, if any, is included in current period earnings within interest expense. For the current reporting period, hedge ineffectiveness associated with interest rate swaps was not material. During the fiscal second quarter of 2016, the Company designated its Euro denominated notes issued in May 2016 with due dates ranging from 2022 to 2035 as a net investment hedge of the Company's investments in certain of its international subsidiaries that use the Euro as their functional currency in order to reduce the volatility caused by changes in exchange rates. The change in the carrying value due to remeasurement of these Euro notes resulted in a $597 million unrealized pretax loss for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017, reflected in foreign currency translation adjustment, within the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income. The change in the carrying value due to remeasurement of these Euro notes resulted in a cumulative $222 million unrealized pretax loss from hedge inception through the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017, reflected in foreign currency translation adjustment, within the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income.  As of December 31, 2017 , the balance of deferred net gains on derivatives included in accumulated other comprehensive income was $70 million after-tax. For additional information, see the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income and Note 13. The Company expects that substantially all of the amounts related to forward foreign exchange contracts will be reclassified into earnings over the next 12 months as a result of transactions that are expected to occur over that period. The maximum length of time over which the Company is hedging transaction exposure is 18 months , excluding interest rate contracts, net investment hedges and equity collar contracts. The amount ultimately realized in earnings may differ as foreign exchange rates change. Realized gains and losses are ultimately determined by actual exchange rates at maturity of the derivative. The following table is a summary of the activity related to derivatives designated as cash flow hedges for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2017 and January 1, 2017 : ##TABLE_START (Dollars in Millions)  Gain/(Loss) Recognized In Accumulated OCI (1)  Gain/(Loss) Reclassified From Accumulated OCI Into Income (1)  Gain/(Loss) Recognized In Other Income/Expense (2) Cash Flow Hedges by Income Statement Caption       Sales to customers (3)  $  (65 )  (31 )  (47 )  (1 )  (1 ) Cost of products sold (3)   (212 )  (159 )  (3 )  (10 )  (15 ) Research and development expense (3)  (199 )  (76 )  (165 )  (90 )    Interest (income)/Interest expense, net (4)         Other (income) expense, net (3) (5)  (60 )  (72 )  (87 )  (7 )    Total  $ (4 )  (359 )  (359 )  (110 )  (6 )  (14 ) ##TABLE_ENDAll amounts shown in the table above are net of tax. ##TABLE_START (1)  Effective portion ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (2)  Ineffective portion ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (3)  Forward foreign exchange contracts ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (4)  Cross currency interest rate swaps  ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (5)  Includes equity collar contracts ##TABLE_END  ##TABLE_START  ##TABLE_END For the fiscal years ended December 31, 2017 and January 1, 2017 , a loss of $5 million and $56 million , respectively, was recognized in Other (income) expense, net, relating to forward foreign exchange contracts not designated as hedging instruments. Fair value is the exit price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability. Fair value is a market-based measurement determined using assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability. The authoritative literature establishes a three-level hierarchy to prioritize the inputs used in measuring fair value. The levels within the hierarchy are described below with Level 1 having the highest priority and Level 3 having the lowest. The fair value of a derivative financial instrument (i.e., forward foreign exchange contracts, interest rate contracts) is the aggregation by currency of all future cash flows discounted to its present value at the prevailing market interest rates and subsequently converted to the U.S. Dollar at the current spot foreign exchange rate. The Company does not believe that fair values of these derivative instruments materially differ from the amounts that could be realized upon settlement or maturity, or that the changes in fair value will have a material effect on the Companys results of operations, cash flows or financial position. The Company also holds equity investments which are classified as Level 1 and debt securities which are classified as Level 2. The Company did not have any other significant financial assets or liabilities which would require revised valuations under this standard that are recognized at fair value. The following three levels of inputs are used to measure fair value: Level 1  Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities. Level 2  Significant other observable inputs. Level 3  Significant unobservable inputs. The Companys significant financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value as of December 31, 2017 and January 1, 2017 were as follows: ##TABLE_START    (Dollars in Millions)  Level 1  Level 2  Level 3  Total  Total (1) Derivatives designated as hedging instruments:           Assets:           Forward foreign exchange contracts (7)  $       Interest rate contracts (2)(4) (7)        Total        Liabilities:           Forward foreign exchange contracts (7)        Interest rate contracts (3)(4) (7)        Equity collar contracts          Total        1,162 Derivatives not designated as hedging instruments:           Assets:           Forward foreign exchange contracts (7)        Liabilities:           Forward foreign exchange contracts (7)        Available For Sale Other Investments:           Equity investments (5)        1,209 Debt securities (6)  $   5,310    5,310  12,087 ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (1)  2016 assets and liabilities are all classified as Level 2 with the exception of equity investments of $1,209 million , which are classified as Level 1. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (2)  Includes $7 million and $23 million of non-current assets for the fiscal years ending December 31, 2017 and January 1, 2017 , respectively. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (3)  Includes $9 million and $382 million of non-current liabilities for the fiscal years ending December 31, 2017 and January 1, 2017 , respectively. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (4)  Includes cross currency interest rate swaps and interest rate swaps. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START (5)  Classified as non-current other assets.

The Company has access to substantial sources of funds at numerous banks worldwide. In September 2017 , the Company secured a new 364-day Credit Facility. Total credit available to the Company approximates $10 billion , which expires on September 13, 2018 . Interest charged on borrowings under the credit line agreements is based on either bids provided by banks, the prime rate or London Interbank Offered Rates (LIBOR), plus applicable margins. Commitment fees under the agreements are not material. Throughout 2017 , the Company continued to have access to liquidity through the commercial paper market. Short-term borrowings and the current portion of long-term debt amounted to approximately $3.9 billion at the end of 2017 , of which $2.3 billion was borrowed under the Commercial Paper Program, $1.5 billion is the current portion of the long term debt, and the remainder principally represents local borrowing by international subsidiaries. Throughout 2016, the Company continued to have access to liquidity through the commercial paper market. Short-term borrowings and the current portion of long-term debt amounted to approximately $4.7 billion at the end of 2016, of which $2.7 billion was borrowed under the Commercial Paper Program, $1.7 billion is the current portion of the long term debt, and the remainder principally represents local borrowing by international subsidiaries. Aggregate maturities of long-term obligations commencing in 2018 are: ##TABLE_START (Dollars in Millions)              After 2022 $1,499  2,752  1,105  1,797  2,189  22,832 ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START 8. Income Taxes ##TABLE_END Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) and SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin 118 (SAB 118) On December 22, 2017, the United States enacted into law new U.S. tax legislation, referred to as the TCJA. This law includes provisions for a comprehensive overhaul of the corporate income tax code, including a reduction of the statutory corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%, effective on January 1, 2018. This new legislation also eliminated or reduced certain corporate income tax deductions as well as introduced new provisions that taxed certain foreign income not previously taxed by the United States. The TCJA also includes a provision for a tax on all previously undistributed earnings of U.S. companies located in foreign jurisdictions. Undistributed earnings in the form of cash and cash equivalents is taxed at a rate of 15.5% and all other earnings are taxed at a rate of 8.0%. This tax is payable over 8 years and will not accrue interest. In December 2017, the SEC provided regulatory guidance for accounting of the impacts of the TCJA, referred to as SAB 118. Under the guidance in SAB 118, the income tax effects, which the accounting under ASC 740 is incomplete, are reported as a provisional amount based on a reasonable estimate. The reasonable estimate is subject to adjustment during a \"measurement period\", not to exceed one year, until the accounting is complete. The estimate is also subject to the finalization of managements analysis related to certain matters, such as developing interpretations of the provision of the TCJA, changes to certain estimates and amounts related to the earnings and profits of certain subsidiaries and the filing of tax returns. As a result of the enactment of the TCJA, the Company recorded a provisional tax cost of $13.0 billion in the fourth quarter of 2017. This provisional charge was assessed as of January 18, 2018 and consisted of: ##TABLE_START  a $10.1 billion charge on previously undistributed foreign earnings as of December 31, 2017 ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  a $4.5 billion deferred tax liability for foreign local and withholding taxes, offset by a $1.1 billion deferred tax asset for U.S. foreign tax credits, for repatriation of substantially all those earnings ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  a $0.6 billion tax benefit relating to the remeasurement of U.S. deferred tax assets and liabilities and the impact of the TCJA on tax reserves, and ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  a $0.1 billion charge for U.S. state and local taxes on the repatriation of these foreign earnings. ##TABLE_END In determining this charge, the Company utilized the most recent information and guidance available related to the calculation of the tax liability and the impact to its deferred tax assets and liabilities, including those recorded for foreign local and withholding taxes that the Company assessed as of January 18, 2018. The provisional charge may require further adjustments and changes to the Companys estimates as new guidance is made available. Revisions to the provisional charge may be material to the Company's financial results. The TCJA also includes provisions for a tax on global intangible low-taxed income (GILTI). GILTI is described as the excess of a U.S. shareholders total net foreign income over a deemed return on tangible assets, as provided by the TCJA. In January 2018, in response to inquiries by companies, the FASB issued guidance that allows companies to elect as an accounting policy whether to treat the GILTI tax as a period cost or to recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities when basis differences exist that are expected to affect the amount of GILTI inclusion upon reversal. The Company has provisionally elected to treat GILTI as a period expense pending further analysis of this new tax provision. The provision for taxes on income consists of: ##TABLE_START (Dollars in Millions)    Currently payable:       U.S. taxes  $ 11,969  1,896  2,748 International taxes  1,998  1,708  1,309 Total currently payable  13,967  3,604  4,057 Deferred:       U.S. taxes  (1,956 )   International taxes  4,362  (635 )  (307 ) Total deferred  2,406  (341 )  (270 ) Provision for taxes on income  $ 16,373  3,263  3,787 ##TABLE_ENDA comparison of income tax expense at the U.S. statutory rate of 35% in 2017 , 2016 and 2015 , to the Companys effective tax rate is as follows: ##TABLE_START (Dollars in Millions)    U.S.  $ 4,865  7,457  8,179 International  12,808  12,346  11,017 Earnings before taxes on income:  $ 17,673  19,803  19,196 Tax rates:       U.S. statutory rate  35.0 %  35.0  35.0 International operations (1)  (12.8 )  (17.2 )  (15.4 ) Research and orphan drug tax credits  (0.4 )  (0.4 )  (0.2 ) U.S. state and local  0.6  (0.1 )  0.4 U.S. manufacturing deduction  (0.8 )  (0.6 )  (0.6 ) U.S. tax on international income  0.7  1.3  0.2 Tax benefits on share based compensation  (2.1 )  (1.8 )   U.S. tax benefit on asset/business disposals  (0.8 )     All other  (0.1 )  0.3  0.3 TCJA impact  73.3 (2)     Effective Rate  92.6 %  16.5 %  19.7 % ##TABLE_END(1) For all periods presented the Company has subsidiaries operating in Puerto Rico under various tax incentives. In 2017, International operations reflects the impacts of operations in jurisdictions with statutory tax rates different than the United States, particularly Ireland, Switzerland and Puerto Rico, which is a  ##TABLE_START  ##TABLE_END favorable impact on the effective tax rate as compared with the 35.0% U.S. statutory rate. The 2017 amount also includes tax cost related to the revaluation of deferred tax balances related to the change in the Belgian statutory tax rate increasing the tax provision by approximately 3.4% . (2) Includes U.S. state and local taxes provisionally recorded as part TCJA provisional charge which was approximately 0.6% of the total effective tax rate The 2017 effective tax rate increased by 76.1% as compared to 2016, primarily driven by the enactment of the TCJA in the United States in December 2017. The enactment of the TCJA resulted in a provisional tax charge in the fourth quarter of 2017, of approximately $13.0 billion or approximately 73.3 percentage point increase to the effective tax rate. The remainder of the increase in the tax rate for 2017 was related to the remeasurement of the Companys deferred tax assets in Belgium, as a result of changes in the Belgian statutory corporate tax rate enacted in December 2017, offset by a tax benefit for the closure of the Companys Animas insulin pump business. The decrease in the 2016 effective tax rate, as compared to 2015 was primarily attributable to the Company adopting a new accounting standard for the reporting of additional tax benefits on share-based compensation that vested or were exercised during the fiscal year. The remainder of the change in the effective tax rate was primarily related to the lower earnings before taxes in the United States and the settlement of several uncertain tax positions in 2016 versus 2015. The decrease in the 2015 effective tax rate, as compared to 2014 was primarily attributable to the increases in taxable income in lower tax jurisdictions relative to higher tax jurisdictions and a tax benefit resulting from a restructuring of international affiliates. The items noted above reflect the key drivers of the rate reconciliation. Temporary differences and carryforwards for 2017 and 2016 were as follows: ##TABLE_START   2017 Deferred Tax  2016 Deferred Tax (Dollars in Millions)  Asset  Liability  Asset  Liability Employee related obligations  $ 2,259   2,958  Stock based compensation     Depreciation   (9 )   (219 ) Non-deductible intangibles   (6,506 )   (6,672 ) International RD capitalized for tax  1,307   1,264  Reserves  liabilities  1,718   1,857  Income reported for tax purposes  1,316   1,309  Net operating loss carryforward international     Undistributed foreign earnings  1,101  (4,457 )     Miscellaneous international   (194 )  1,135  (15 ) Miscellaneous U.S.     Total deferred income taxes  $ 9,902  (11,166 )  10,144  (6,906 ) ##TABLE_ENDThe Company has wholly-owned international subsidiaries that have cumulative net losses. The Company believes that it is more likely than not that these subsidiaries will realize future taxable income sufficient to utilize these deferred tax assets. The following table summarizes the activity related to unrecognized tax benefits: ##TABLE_START (Dollars in Millions)    Beginning of year  $ 3,041  3,080  2,465 Increases related to current year tax positions    Increases related to prior period tax positions    Decreases related to prior period tax positions  (416 ) (1) (338 )  (79 ) Settlements  (2 )  (37 )  (4 ) Lapse of statute of limitations  (36 )  (23 )  (54 ) End of year  $ 3,151  3,041  3,080 ##TABLE_END(1) $347 million of this decrease is related to the TCJA The unrecognized tax benefits of $3.2 billion at December 31, 2017 , if recognized, would affect the Companys annual effective tax rate. The Company conducts business and files tax returns in numerous countries and currently has tax audits in progress with a number of tax authorities. The IRS has completed its audit for the tax years through 2009 and is currently auditing the tax years 2010-2012. In other major jurisdictions where the Company conducts business, the years remain open generally back to the year 2004. The Company believes it is possible that audits may be completed by tax authorities in some  ##TABLE_START  ##TABLE_END jurisdictions over the next twelve months. However, the Company is not able to provide a reasonably reliable estimate of the timing of any other future tax payments relating to uncertain tax positions. The Company classifies liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits and related interest and penalties as long-term liabilities. Interest expense and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits are classified as income tax expense. The Company recognized after tax interest expense of $60 million , $7 million and $44 million in 2017 , 2016 and 2015 , respectively. The total amount of accrued interest was $436 million and $344 million in 2017 and 2016 , respectively. ##TABLE_START 9.

Pensions and Other Benefit Plans ##TABLE_END The Company sponsors various retirement and pension plans, including defined benefit, defined contribution and termination indemnity plans, which cover most employees worldwide. The Company also provides post-retirement benefits, primarily health care, to all eligible U.S. retired employees and their dependents. Many international employees are covered by government-sponsored programs and the cost to the Company is not significant. Retirement plan benefits for employees are primarily based on the employees compensation during the last three to five years before retirement and the number of years of service. Due to an amendment of the formula used to calculate benefits of the U.S. Defined Benefit Plan that occurred in 2014, benefits for employees hired on or after January 1, 2015, are primarily calculated using employee compensation over total years of service. International subsidiaries have plans under which funds are deposited with trustees, annuities are purchased under group contracts, or reserves are provided. The Company does not typically fund retiree health care benefits in advance, but may do so at its discretion. The Company also has the right to modify these plans in the future. In 2017 and 2016 the Company used December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016 , respectively, as the measurement date for all U.S. and international retirement and other benefit plans. Net periodic benefit costs for the Companys defined benefit retirement plans and other benefit plans for 2017 , 2016 and 2015 include the following components: ##TABLE_START   Retirement Plans  Other Benefit Plans (Dollars in Millions)       Service cost  $ 1,080   1,037    Interest cost       Expected return on plan assets  (2,041 )  (1,962 )  (1,809 )  (6 )  (6 )  (7 ) Amortization of prior service cost (credit)     (30 )  (34 )  (33 ) Recognized actuarial losses       Curtailments and settlements          Net periodic benefit cost  $      ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  ##TABLE_END Amounts expected to be recognized in net periodic benefit cost in the coming year for the Companys defined benefit retirement plans and other post-retirement plans: ##TABLE_START (Dollars in Millions)  Amortization of net transition obligation $  Amortization of net actuarial losses Amortization of prior service credit ##TABLE_ENDUnrecognized gains and losses for the U.S. pension plans are amortized over the average remaining future service for each plan. For plans with no active employees, they are amortized over the average life expectancy. The amortization of gains and losses for the other U.S. benefit plans is determined by using a 10% corridor of the greater of the market value of assets or the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation. Total unamortized gains and losses in excess of the corridor are amortized over the average remaining future service. Prior service costs/benefits for the U.S. pension plans are amortized over the average remaining future service of plan participants at the time of the plan amendment. Prior service cost/benefit for the other U.S. benefit plans is amortized over the average remaining service to full eligibility age of plan participants at the time of the plan amendment. The following table represents the weighted-average actuarial assumptions: ##TABLE_START   Retirement Plans  Other Benefit Plans Worldwide Benefit Plans       Net Periodic Benefit Cost             Service cost discount rate  3.59 %  3.98  3.78  4.63  4.77  4.31 Interest cost discount rate  3.98 %  4.24  3.78  3.94  4.10  4.31 Rate of increase in compensation levels  4.01 %  4.02  4.05  4.31  4.32  4.11 Expected long-term rate of return on plan assets  8.43 %  8.55  8.53                    Benefit Obligation             Discount rate  3.30 %  3.78  4.11  3.78  4.42  4.63 Rate of increase in compensation levels  3.99 %  4.02  4.01  4.30  4.29  4.28 ##TABLE_ENDThe Companys discount rates are determined by considering current yield curves representing high quality, long-term fixed income instruments. The resulting discount rates are consistent with the duration of plan liabilities. For the fiscal year 2016, the Company changed its methodology in determining service and interest cost from the single weighted average discount rate approach to duration specific spot rates along that yield curve to the plans liability cash flows, which management has concluded is a more precise estimate. Prior to this change in methodology, the Company measured service and interest costs utilizing a single weighted-average discount rate derived from the yield curve used to measure the plan obligations. The Company has accounted for this change as a change in accounting estimate and, accordingly, has accounted for it on a prospective basis. This change does not impact the benefit obligation and did not have a material impact to the 2016 full year results. The expected rates of return on plan asset assumptions represent the Company's assessment of long-term returns on diversified investment portfolios globally. The assessment is determined using projections from external financial sources, long-term historical averages, actual returns by asset class and the various asset class allocations by market.  ##TABLE_START  ##TABLE_END The following table displays the assumed health care cost trend rates, for all individuals: ##TABLE_START Health Care Plans   Health care cost trend rate assumed for next year  6.33 %  6.32 % Rate to which the cost trend rate is assumed to decline (ultimate trend)  4.55 %  4.50 % Year the rate reaches the ultimate trend rate   ##TABLE_ENDA one-percentage-point change in assumed health care cost trend rates would have the following effect: ##TABLE_START   One-Percentage-  One-Percentage- (Dollars in Millions)  Point Increase  Point Decrease Health Care Plans     Total interest and service cost  $  (23 ) Post-retirement benefit obligation  $  (291 ) ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  ##TABLE_END The following table sets forth information related to the benefit obligation and the fair value of plan assets at year-end 2017 and 2016 for the Companys defined benefit retirement plans and other post-retirement plans: ##TABLE_START   Retirement Plans  Other Benefit Plans (Dollars in Millions)     Change in Benefit Obligation         Projected benefit obligation  beginning of year  $ 28,116  25,855  4,605  4,669 Service cost  1,080    Interest cost     Plan participant contributions       Amendments  (7 )  (48 )  (17 )   Actuarial (gains) losses  2,996  2,302  (166 )  (73 ) Divestitures  acquisitions   (24 )    Curtailments, settlements  restructuring  (35 )  (25 )    Benefits paid from plan*  (1,050 )  (1,210 )  (351 )  (378 ) Effect of exchange rates   (664 )   Projected benefit obligation  end of year  $ 33,221  28,116  4,582  4,605 Change in Plan Assets         Plan assets at fair value  beginning of year  $ 23,633  22,254   Actual return on plan assets  4,274  2,286   Company contributions     Plan participant contributions       Settlements  (32 )  (25 )     Divestitures  acquisitions   (24 )     Benefits paid from plan assets*  (1,050 )  (1,210 )  (351 )  (378 ) Effect of exchange rates   (540 )     Plan assets at fair value  end of year  $ 28,404  23,633   Funded status  end of year  $ (4,817 )  (4,483 )  (4,301 )  (4,530 ) Amounts Recognized in the Companys Balance Sheet consist of the following:         Non-current assets  $      Current liabilities  (92 )  (86 )  (228 )  (315 ) Non-current liabilities  (5,251 )  (4,624 )  (4,073 )  (4,215 ) Total recognized in the consolidated balance sheet  end of year  $ (4,817 )  (4,483 )  (4,301 )  (4,530 ) Amounts Recognized in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income consist of the following:         Net actuarial loss  $ 8,140  7,749  1,500  1,804 Prior service cost (credit)  (25 )  (12 )  (137 )  (150 ) Unrecognized net transition obligation         Total before tax effects  $ 8,115  7,737  1,363  1,654          Accumulated Benefit Obligations  end of year  $ 29,793  25,319              *In 2016, the Company offered a voluntary lump-sum payment option below a pre-determined threshold for certain eligible former employees who are vested participants of the U.S. Qualified Defined Benefit Pension Plan.

International Plans are funded in accordance with local regulations. Additional discretionary contributions are made when deemed appropriate to meet the long-term obligations of the plans. For certain plans, funding is not a common practice, as funding provides no economic benefit. Consequently, the Company has several pension plans that are not funded. In 2017 , the Company contributed $72 million and $592 million to its U.S. and international pension plans, respectively.

In determining investment policies, strategies and goals, each committee or board considers factors including, local pension rules and regulations; local tax regulations; availability of investment vehicles (separate accounts, commingled accounts, insurance funds, etc.); funded status of the plans; ratio of actives to retirees; duration of liabilities; and other relevant factors including: diversification, liquidity of local markets and liquidity of base currency. A majority of the Companys pension funds are open to new entrants and are expected to be on-going plans. Permitted investments are primarily liquid and/or listed, with little reliance on illiquid and non-traditional investments such as hedge funds. The Companys retirement plan asset allocation at the end of 2017 and 2016 and target allocations for 2018 are as follows: ##TABLE_START   Percent of Plan Assets  Target Allocation     Worldwide Retirement Plans       Equity securities  %  %  % Debt securities    Total plan assets  %  %  % ##TABLE_ENDDetermination of Fair Value of Plan Assets The Plan has an established and well-documented process for determining fair values. Fair value is based upon quoted market prices, where available. If listed prices or quotes are not available, fair value is based upon models that primarily use, as inputs, market-based or independently sourced market parameters, including yield curves, interest rates, volatilities, equity or debt prices, foreign exchange rates and credit curves. While the Plan believes its valuation methods are appropriate and consistent with other market participants, the use of different methodologies or assumptions to determine the fair value of certain financial instruments could result in a different estimate of fair value at the reporting date. Valuation Hierarchy The authoritative literature establishes a three-level hierarchy to prioritize the inputs used in measuring fair value. The levels within the hierarchy are described in the table below with Level 1 having the highest priority and Level 3 having the lowest. A financial instruments categorization within the valuation hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. Following is a description of the valuation methodologies used for the investments measured at fair value. ##TABLE_START  Short-term investment funds  Cash and quoted short-term instruments are valued at the closing price or the amount held on deposit by the custodian bank. Other investments are through investment vehicles valued using the Net Asset Value (NAV) provided by the administrator of the fund. The NAV is based on the value of the underlying assets owned by the fund, minus its liabilities, and then divided by the number of shares outstanding. The NAV is a quoted price in a market that is not active and classified as Level 2. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Government and agency securities  A limited number of these investments are valued at the closing price reported on the major market on which the individual securities are traded. Where quoted prices are available in an active market, the investments are classified within Level 1 of the valuation hierarchy. If quoted market prices are not available for the specific security, then fair values are estimated by using pricing models, quoted prices of securities with similar characteristics or discounted cash flows. When quoted market prices for a security are not available in an active market, they are classified as Level 2. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Debt instruments  A limited number of these investments are valued at the closing price reported on the major market on which the individual securities are traded. Where quoted prices are available in an active market, the investments are classified as Level 1. If quoted market prices are not available for the specific security, then fair values are estimated by using pricing models, quoted prices of securities with similar characteristics or discounted cash flows and are classified as Level 2. Level 3 debt instruments are priced based on unobservable inputs. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Equity securities  Equity securities are valued at the closing price reported on the major market on which the individual securities are traded. Substantially all common stock is classified within Level 1 of the valuation hierarchy. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Commingled funds  These investment vehicles are valued using the NAV provided by the fund administrator. The NAV is based on the value of the underlying assets owned by the fund, minus its liabilities, and then divided by the number of shares outstanding. Assets in the Level 2 category have a quoted market price. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  Insurance contracts  The instruments are issued by insurance companies. The fair value is based on negotiated value and the underlying investments held in separate account portfolios as well as considering the credit worthiness of the issuer. The underlying investments are government, asset-backed and fixed income securities. In general, insurance contracts are classified as Level 3 as there are no quoted prices nor other observable inputs for pricing. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Other assets  Other assets are represented primarily by limited partnerships and real estate investments, as well as commercial loans and commercial mortgages that are not classified as corporate debt. Other assets that are exchange listed and actively traded are classified as Level 1, while inactively traded assets are classified as Level 2. ##TABLE_END The following table sets forth the Retirement Plans' investments measured at fair value as of December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016: ##TABLE_START   Quoted Prices in Active Markets for Identical Assets  Significant Other Observable Inputs  Significant Unobservable Inputs (a)  Investments Measured at Net Asset Value       (Level 1)  (Level 2)  (Level 3)      Total Assets (Dollars in Millions)           Short-term investment funds  $              Government and agency securities      3,094  2,655          3,094  2,655 Debt instruments      2,013  1,237          2,013  1,237 Equity securities  13,848  11,433             13,848  11,445 Commingled funds      1,780  1,316     6,158  5,767  7,995  7,083 Insurance contracts                 Other assets                Investments at fair value  $ 14,277  11,578  7,435  5,872    6,436  6,159  28,404  23,633 ##TABLE_END(a)  The activity for the Level 3 assets is not significant for all years presented.

Employee Benefit Plans - reclassifications are included in net periodic benefit cost. See Note 10 for additional details. Gain/(Loss) On Derivatives  Hedges - reclassifications to earnings are recorded in the same account as the hedged transaction. See Note 6 for additional details.  ##TABLE_START  ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START 14. International Currency Translation ##TABLE_END For translation of its subsidiaries operating in non-U.S. Dollar currencies, the Company has determined that the local currencies of its international subsidiaries are the functional currencies except those in highly inflationary economies, which are defined as those which have had compound cumulative rates of inflation of 100% or more during the past three years , or where a substantial portion of its cash flows are not in the local currency. For the majority of the Company's subsidiaries the local currency is the functional currency. In consolidating international subsidiaries, balance sheet currency effects are recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income. This equity account includes the results of translating certain balance sheet assets and liabilities at current exchange rates and some accounts at historical rates, except for those located in highly inflationary economies. The translation of balance sheet accounts for highly inflationary economies are reflected in the operating results. A rollforward of the changes during 2017 , 2016 and 2015 for foreign currency translation adjustments is included in Note 13. Net currency transaction gains and losses included in Other (income) expense were losses of $216 million , $289 million and $104 million in 2017 , 2016 and 2015 , respectively. ##TABLE_START 15.

Common Stock, Stock Option Plans and Stock Compensation Agreements ##TABLE_END At December 31, 2017 , the Company had 2 stock-based compensation plans. The shares outstanding are for contracts under the Company's 2005 Long-Term Incentive Plan and the 2012 Long-Term Incentive Plan. The 2005 Long-Term Incentive Plan expired April 26, 2012. All options and restricted shares granted subsequent to that date were under the 2012 Long-Term Incentive Plan. Under the 2012 Long-Term Incentive Plan, the Company may issue up to 650 million shares of common stock, plus any shares canceled, expired, forfeited, or not issued from the 2005 Long-Term Incentive Plan subsequent to April 26, 2012. Shares available for future grants under the 2012 Long-Term Incentive Plan were 389 million at the end of 2017 . The compensation cost that has been charged against income for these plans was $962 million , $878 million and $874 million for 2017 , 2016 and 2015 , respectively. The total income tax benefit recognized in the income statement for share-based compensation costs was $275 million , $256 million and $253 million for 2017 , 2016 and 2015 , respectively. An additional tax  ##TABLE_START  ##TABLE_END benefit of $353 million was recognized in 2016 due to the adoption of a new accounting standard for the reporting of additional tax benefits on share-based compensation. The total unrecognized compensation cost was $798 million , $749 million and $744 million for 2017 , 2016 and 2015 , respectively. The weighted average period for this cost to be recognized was 1.76 years, 1.09 years and 0.98 years for 2017 , 2016 , and 2015 , respectively. Share-based compensation costs capitalized as part of inventory were insignificant in all periods. The Company settles employee benefit equity issuances with treasury shares. Treasury shares are replenished throughout the year for the number of shares used to settle employee benefit equity issuances. Stock Options Stock options expire 10 years from the date of grant and vest over service periods that range from 6 months to 4 years . All options are granted at the average of the high and low prices of the Companys Common Stock on the New York Stock Exchange on the date of grant. The fair value of each option award was estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option valuation model that uses the assumptions noted in the following table. For 2017, 2016 and 2015 grants, expected volatility represents a blended rate of 10-year weekly historical overall volatility rate, and a 5-week average implied volatility rate based on at-the-money traded Johnson  Johnson options with a life of 2 years. For all grants, historical data is used to determine the expected life of the option. The risk-free rate was based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant. The average fair value of options granted was $13.38 , $10.01 and $10.68 , in 2017 , 2016 and 2015 , respectively. The fair value was estimated based on the weighted average assumptions of: ##TABLE_START    Risk-free rate 2.25 %  1.51 %  1.77 % Expected volatility 15.30 %  15.76 %  15.48 % Expected life (in years) 7.0  7.0  7.0 Expected dividend yield 2.90 %  3.10 %  2.90 % ##TABLE_ENDA summary of option activity under the Plan as of December 31, 2017 , January 1, 2017 and January 3, 2016 , and changes during the years ending on those dates is presented below: ##TABLE_START (Shares in Thousands)  Outstanding Shares  Weighted Average Exercise Price  Aggregate Intrinsic Value (Dollars in Millions) Shares at December 28, 2014  115,712  $ 70.37  $ 4,014 Options granted  20,484  100.06   Options exercised  (16,683 )  62.53   Options canceled/forfeited  (2,996 )  82.22   Shares at January 3, 2016  116,517  76.41  3,065 Options granted  22,491  101.87   Options exercised  (22,547 )  65.66   Options canceled/forfeited  (3,006 )  92.83   Shares at January 1, 2017  113,455  83.16  3,636 Options granted  19,287  115.67   Options exercised  (18,975 )  70.87   Options canceled/forfeited  (2,461 )  101.40   Shares at December 31, 2017  111,306  $ 90.48  $ 5,480 ##TABLE_ENDThe total intrinsic value of options exercised was $1,060 million , $980 million and $644 million in 2017 , 2016 and 2015 , respectively.  ##TABLE_START  ##TABLE_END The following table summarizes stock options outstanding and exercisable at December 31, 2017 : ##TABLE_START (Shares in Thousands)  Outstanding  Exercisable Exercise Price Range  Options  Average Life (1)  Average Exercise Price  Options  Average Exercise Price $52.13-$62.20  12,148  1.7  $60.37  12,148  $60.37 $62.62-$65.62  9,548  3.0  $63.91  9,547  $63.91 $66.07-$72.54  14,816  5.0  $72.53  14,816  $72.53 $90.44-$100.48  35,035  6.6  $95.48  15,843  $90.49 $101.87-$115.67  39,759  8.6  $108.35   $105.91   111,306  6.3  $90.48  52,421  $73.61 ##TABLE_END(1) Average contractual life remaining in years. Stock options outstanding at January 1, 2017 and January 3, 2016 were 113,455 and an average life of 6.2 years and 116,517 and an average life of 5.9 years, respectively. Stock options exercisable at January 1, 2017 and January 3, 2016 were 50,414 at an average price of $65.77 and 48,345 at an average price of $62.26 , respectively. Restricted Share Units and Performance Share Units The Company grants restricted share units which vest over service periods that range from 6 months to 3 years . The Company also grants performance share units, which are paid in shares of Johnson  Johnson Common Stock after the end of a three -year performance period. Whether any performance share units vest, and the amount that does vest, is tied to the completion of service periods that range from 6 months to 3 years and the achievement, over a three -year period, of three equally-weighted goals that directly align with or help drive long-term total shareholder return: operational sales, adjusted operational earnings per share, and relative total shareholder return. The number of shares actually earned at the end of the three -year period will vary, based only on actual performance, from 0% to 200% of the target number of performance share units granted . In the fourth quarter of 2017, the Company modified the restricted share units that are scheduled to vest between January 1, 2018 and March 15, 2018. This modification guaranteed a minimum aggregate value, below the market value of the total expected payout amount, for all awards expected to vest during this period. The amount that was committed was not material to the Companys overall financial position. A summary of the restricted share units and performance share units activity under the Plans as of December 31, 2017 is presented below: ##TABLE_START (Shares in Thousands)  Outstanding Restricted Share Units  Outstanding Performance Share Units Shares at January 1, 2017  21,061  2,415 Granted  7,248  1,276 Issued  (7,205 )  (1,361 ) Canceled/forfeited/adjusted  (943 )  Shares at December 31, 2017  20,161  2,625 ##TABLE_ENDThe average fair value of the restricted share units granted was $107.69 , $92.45 and $91.65 in 2017 , 2016 and 2015 , respectively, using the fair market value at the date of grant. The fair value of restricted share units was discounted for dividends, which are not paid on the restricted share units during the vesting period. The fair value of restricted share units issued was $596.5 million , $587.7 million and $597.6 million in 2017 , 2016 and 2015 , respectively. The weighted average fair value of the performance share units granted was $114.13 , $105.30 and $93.54 in 2017 , 2016 and 2015 , calculated using the weighted average fair market value for each of the three component goals at the date of grant. The fair values for the sales and earnings per share goals of each performance share unit were estimated on the date of grant using the fair market value of the shares at the time of the award discounted for dividends, which are not paid on the performance share units during the vesting period. The fair value for the relative total shareholder return goal of each performance share unit was estimated on the date of grant using the Monte Carlo valuation model.

Business Combinations and Divestitures ##TABLE_END Certain businesses were acquired for $35,151 million in cash and $1,786 million of liabilities assumed during 2017. These acquisitions were accounted for using the acquisition method and, accordingly, results of operations have been included in the financial statements from their respective dates of acquisition. The 2017 acquisitions primarily included: Actelion Ltd an established leading franchise of differentiated, innovative products for pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH); Abbott Medical Optics (AMO), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Abbott Laboratories, which included ophthalmic products related to: cataract surgery, laser refractive surgery and consumer eye health; Neuravi Limited, a privately-held medical device company that develops and markets medical devices for neurointerventional therapy; TearScience Inc., a manufacturer of products dedicated to treating meibomian gland dysfunction; Sightbox, Inc., a privately-held company that developed a subscription vision care service that connects consumers with eye care professionals and a supply of contact lenses; Torax Medical, Inc., a privately-held medical device company that manufactures and markets the LINX Reflux Management System for the surgical treatment of gastroesophageal reflux disease and Megadyne Medical Products, Inc., a privately-held medical device company that develops, manufactures and markets electrosurgical tools. The excess of purchase price over the estimated fair value of tangible assets acquired amounted to $34,379 million and has been assigned to identifiable intangible assets, with any residual recorded to goodwill. Of this amount, approximately $1,139 million has been identified as the value of IPRD primarily associated with the acquisition of Actelion Ltd. The value of the IPRD was calculated using cash flow projections discounted for the inherent risk in the projects. During 2017, the Company completed the acquisition of Actelion Ltd through an all cash tender offer in Switzerland for $280 per share, amounting to $29.6 billion , net of cash acquired. As part of the transaction, immediately prior to the completion of the acquisition, Actelion spun out its drug discovery operations and early-stage clinical development assets into a newly created Swiss biopharmaceutical company, Idorsia Ltd. The shares of Idorsia are listed on the SIX Swiss Exchange (SIX). The Company currently holds 9.9% of the shares of Idorsia and has rights to an additional 22.1% of Idorsia equity through a convertible loan with a principal amount of approximately $0.5 billion . The convertible loan may be converted into Idorsia shares as follows: (i) up to an aggregate shareholding of 16% of Idorsia shares as a result of certain shareholders holding more than 20% of the issued Idorsia shares, and (ii) up to the balance of the remaining amount within 20 business days of the maturity date of the convertible loan, which has a 10 year term, or if Idorsia undergoes a change of control transaction. The investment in Idorsia was recorded as a cost method investment in Other assets in the Company's consolidated Balance Sheet. The Company also exercised the option acquired on ACT-132577, a product within Idorsia being developed for resistant hypertension currently in phase 2 of clinical development. The Company has also entered into an agreement to provide Idorsia with a Swiss franc denominated credit facility of approximately $250 million . As of December 31, 2017, Idorsia has not made any draw-downs under the credit facility. Actelion has entered into a transitional services agreement with Idorsia. Actelion has established a leading franchise of differentiated, innovative products for pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) that are highly complementary to the existing portfolio of the Company. The addition of Actelions specialty in-market medicines and late-stage products is consistent with the Company's efforts to grow in attractive and complementary therapeutic areas and serve patients with serious illnesses and significant unmet medical need. The Company is still finalizing the allocation of the purchase price to the individual assets acquired and liabilities assumed. The allocation of the purchase price included in the current period balance sheet is based on the best estimate of management and is preliminary and subject to change. To assist management in the allocation, the Company engaged valuation specialists to prepare appraisals. The Company will finalize the amounts recognized as the information necessary to complete the analysis is obtained. The Company expects to finalize these amounts as soon as possible but no later than one year from the acquisition date.  ##TABLE_START  ##TABLE_END The following table presents the preliminary amounts recognized for assets acquired and liabilities assumed for Actelion as of the acquisition date as well as the adjustments made up to December 31, 2017: ##TABLE_START (Dollars in Millions) June 16, 2017 December 31, 2017 Cash  Cash equivalents $ 469 Inventory (1) 759 Accounts Receivable 485 Other current assets 93 Property, plant and equipment 104 Goodwill 5,986 6,161 Intangible assets 25,010 25,010 Deferred Taxes 99 Other non-current assets 19 Total Assets Acquired 32,928 33,199    Current liabilities 956 Deferred Taxes 1,960 1,776 Other non-current liabilities 413 Total Liabilities Assumed 2,874 3,145    Net Assets Acquired $ 30,054 30,054 ##TABLE_END (1) Includes adjustment of $642 million to write-up the acquired inventory to its estimated fair value.  Subsequent to the date of acquisition there was an adjustment of $0.2 billion to the deferred taxes and $0.4 billion to the current liabilities with the offset to goodwill. The assets acquired are recorded in the Pharmaceutical segment. The acquisition of Actelion resulted in approximately $6.2 billion of goodwill. The goodwill is primarily attributable to synergies expected to arise from the acquisition. The goodwill is not expected to be deductible for tax purposes. The purchase price allocation to the identifiable intangible assets is as follows: ##TABLE_START (Dollars in Millions)   Intangible assets with definite lives:   Patents and trademarks  $ 24,230 Total amortizable intangibles  24,230    In-process research and development  Total intangible assets  $ 25,010 ##TABLE_ENDThe patents and trademarks acquired are comprised of developed technology with a weighted average life of 9 years and was primarily based on the patent life of the marketed products. The intangible assets with definite lives were assigned asset lives ranging from 4 to 10 years . The in-process research and development intangible assets were valued for technology programs for unapproved products. The value of the IPRD was calculated using probability adjusted cash flow projections discounted for the risk inherent in such projects. The discount rate applied was 9% . The acquisition was accounted for using the acquisition method and, accordingly, the results of operations of Actelion were reported in the Company's financial statements beginning on June 16, 2017, the date of acquisition. For the year ended December 31, 2017 total sales and a net loss for Actelion from the date of acquisition were $1.4 billion and $1.4 billion , respectively. The following table provides pro forma results of operations for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017 and January 1, 2017, as if Actelion had been acquired as of January 4, 2016. The pro forma results include the effect of certain purchase accounting adjustments such as the estimated changes in depreciation and amortization expense on the acquired tangible and intangible assets. However, pro forma results do not include any anticipated cost savings or other effects of the planned  ##TABLE_START  ##TABLE_END integration of Actelion. Accordingly, such amounts are not necessarily indicative of the results if the acquisition had occurred on the dates indicated or which may occur in the future. ##TABLE_START  Unaudited Pro forma Consolidated Results (Dollars in Millions Except Per Share Data) 2016    Net Sales 77,681 74,339 Net Earnings 1,509 13,916 Diluted Net Earnings per Common Share 0.55 4.99 ##TABLE_ENDIn 2017, the Company recorded Actelion acquisition related costs before tax of approximately $0.8 billion , which was recorded in Other (income)/expense and Cost of products sold. During 2017, the Company acquired Abbott Medical Optics (AMO), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Abbott Laboratories, for $4.3 billion , net of cash acquired. The acquisition included ophthalmic products related to: cataract surgery, laser refractive surgery and consumer eye health. The net purchase price was primarily recorded as amortizable intangible assets for $2.3 billion and goodwill for $1.7 billion . The weighted average life of total amortizable intangibles, the majority being customer relationships, is approximately 14.4 years . The goodwill is primarily attributable to synergies expected to arise from the business acquisition and is not deductible for tax purposes. The intangible assets and goodwill amounts are based on the final purchase price allocation. The assets acquired were recorded in the Medical Devices segment. Certain businesses were acquired for $4,509 million in cash and $77 million of liabilities assumed during 2016. These acquisitions were accounted for using the acquisition method and, accordingly, results of operations have been included in the financial statements from their respective dates of acquisition. The 2016 acquisitions primarily included: Vogue International LLC, a privately-held company focused on the marketing, development and distribution of salon-influenced and nature inspired hair care and other personal products; NeuWave Medical, Inc., a privately-held medical device company that manufactures and markets minimally invasive soft tissue microwave ablation systems; NeoStrata Company, Inc., a global leader in dermocosmetics, and the global rights for the commercialization of RHINOCORT  allergy spray outside the United States. The excess of purchase price over the estimated fair value of tangible assets acquired amounted to $4,077 million and has been assigned to identifiable intangible assets, with any residual recorded to goodwill. The net purchase price for Vogue International LLC of $3.3 billion was primarily recorded as amortizable intangible assets for $2.3 billion and goodwill for $1.1 billion . The weighted average life for the $2.3 billion of total amortizable intangibles is approximately 22 years . The trademark asset values were determined to have definite lives ranging from 10 to 22 years, with the majority being 22 years. The goodwill is primarily attributable to synergies expected to arise from the business acquisition and is expected to be deductible for tax purposes. The assets acquired were recorded in the Consumer segment. Certain businesses were acquired for $954 million in cash and $220 million of liabilities assumed during 2015. The assumed liabilities primarily represent the fair value of the contingent consideration of $210 million . These acquisitions were accounted for using the acquisition method and, accordingly, results of operations have been included in the financial statements from their respective dates of acquisition. The 2015 acquisitions primarily included: XO1 Limited, a privately-held biopharmaceutical company developing an anti-thrombin antibody and Novira Therapeutics, Inc., a privately held clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company developing innovative therapies for curative treatment of chronic hepatitis B virus infection. The excess of purchase price over the estimated fair value of tangible assets acquired amounted to $1,173 million and has been assigned to identifiable intangible assets, with any residual recorded to goodwill. Of this amount, approximately $839 million has been identified as the value of IPRD primarily associated with the acquisitions of XO1 Limited and Novira Therapeutics, Inc. The value of the IPRD was calculated using cash flow projections discounted for the inherent risk in the projects. The IPRD related to the acquisition of XO1 Limited of $360 million is associated with a recombinant human antibody developed to mimic the activity of a human antibody which appears to produce an anticoagulated state without predisposition to bleeding. A probability of success factor of 36.0% was used to reflect inherent clinical and regulatory risk. The discount rate applied was 11.75% . The IPRD related to the acquisition of Novira Therapeutics, Inc. of $396 million is associated with its lead candidate NVR 3-778 which is an investigational small molecule, direct-acting antiviral, for oral administration in patients with HBV that inhibits the HBV core or capsid protein. A probability of success factor of 51.0% was used to reflect inherent clinical and regulatory risk. The discount rate applied was 16.0% . During 2017, the Company recorded a charge for the impairment of the IPRD related to the acquisition of Novira Therapeutics, Inc. The impairment was the result of the cancellation of product development due to safety concerns.  ##TABLE_START  ##TABLE_END In 2012, the Company completed the acquisition of Synthes, Inc. for a purchase price of $20.2 billion in cash and stock. In connection with the acquisition of Synthes, Inc. the Company entered into two accelerated share repurchase (ASR) agreements. In 2013, the Company settled the remaining liabilities under the ASR agreements. While the Company believes that the transactions under each ASR agreement and a series of related internal transactions were consummated in a tax efficient manner in accordance with applicable law, it is possible that the Internal Revenue Service could assert one or more contrary positions to challenge the transactions from a tax perspective. If challenged, an amount up to the total purchase price for the Synthes shares could be treated as subject to applicable U.S. tax at approximately the statutory rate to the Company, plus interest. With the exception of the Actelion Ltd acquisition, supplemental pro forma information for 2017, 2016 and 2015 in accordance with U.S. GAAP standards related to business combinations, and goodwill and other intangible assets, is not provided, as the impact of the aforementioned acquisitions did not have a material effect on the Companys results of operations, cash flows or financial position. During the fiscal first quarter of 2017, the Company announced it is engaging in a process to evaluate potential strategic options for the Johnson  Johnson Diabetes Care Companies, specifically LifeScan, Inc., Animas Corporation, and Calibra Medical, Inc. Strategic options may include the formation of operating partnerships, joint ventures or strategic alliances, a sale of the businesses, or other alternatives either separately or together. During the fiscal second quarter of 2017, the Company recorded an impairment charge of $0.2 billion , primarily related to the insulin pump business. During the fiscal fourth quarter of 2017, the Company announced its decision to exit the Animas insulin pump business. The Company is continuing to evaluate potential strategic options for LifeScan, Inc. and determine the best opportunity to drive future growth and maximize shareholder value. There were no assets held for sale as of December 31, 2017 related to the announcement. During 2017, the Company divestitures primarily included: the Codman Neurosurgery business, to Integra LifeSciences Holdings Corporation and the divestiture of COMPEED  to HRA Pharma. In 2017, the pre-tax gains on the divestitures were approximately $1.3 billion . During 2016, the Company divestitures included: the controlled substance raw material and active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) business; certain anesthetic products in Europe; and certain non-strategic Consumer brands. In 2016, the pre-tax gains on the divestitures were approximately $0.6 billion . During 2015, the Company divestitures included: the Cordis business to Cardinal Health; the SPLENDA  brand to Heartland Food Products Group; and the U.S. license rights to NUCYNTA  (tapentadol), NUCYNTA  ER (tapentadol extended-release tablets), and NUCYNTA  (tapentadol) oral solution. In 2015, the pre-tax gains on the divestitures were approximately $2.6 billion . ##TABLE_START 21. Legal Proceedings ##TABLE_END Johnson  Johnson and certain of its subsidiaries are involved in various lawsuits and claims regarding product liability, intellectual property, commercial and other matters; governmental investigations; and other legal proceedings that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of their business. The Company records accruals for loss contingencies associated with these legal matters when it is probable that a liability will be incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. As of December 31, 2017 , the Company has determined that the liabilities associated with certain litigation matters are probable and can be reasonably estimated. The Company has accrued for these matters and will continue to monitor each related legal issue and adjust accruals as might be warranted based on new information and further developments in accordance with ASC 450-20-25. For these and other litigation and regulatory matters discussed below for which a loss is probable or reasonably possible, the Company is unable to estimate the possible loss or range of loss beyond the amounts already accrued. Amounts accrued for legal contingencies often result from a complex series of judgments about future events and uncertainties that rely heavily on estimates and assumptions. The ability to make such estimates and judgments can be affected by various factors, including whether damages sought in the proceedings are unsubstantiated or indeterminate; scientific and legal discovery has not commenced or is not complete; proceedings are in early stages; matters present legal uncertainties; there are significant facts in dispute; or there are numerous parties involved. In the Company's opinion, based on its examination of these matters, its experience to date and discussions with counsel, the ultimate outcome of legal proceedings, net of liabilities accrued in the Company's balance sheet, is not expected to have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial position. However, the resolution of, or increase in accruals for, one or more of these matters in any reporting period may have a material adverse effect on the Company's results of operations and cash flows for that period. PRODUCT LIABILITY Johnson  Johnson and certain of its subsidiaries are involved in numerous product liability claims and lawsuits involving multiple products. Claimants in these cases seek substantial compensatory and, where available, punitive damages. While the Company believes it has substantial defenses, it is not feasible to predict the ultimate outcome of litigation. The Company has  ##TABLE_START  ##TABLE_END established accruals for product liability claims and lawsuits in compliance with ASC 450-20 based on currently available information, which in some cases may be limited. The Company accrues an estimate of the legal defense costs needed to defend each matter when those costs are probable and can be reasonably estimated. For certain of these matters, the Company has accrued additional amounts such as estimated costs associated with settlements, damages and other losses. To the extent adverse verdicts have been rendered against the Company, the Company does not record an accrual until a loss is determined to be probable and can be reasonably estimated. Product liability accruals can represent projected product liability for thousands of claims around the world, each in different litigation environments and with different fact patterns. Changes to the accruals may be required in the future as additional information becomes available. The most significant of these cases include: the DePuy ASR XL Acetabular System and DePuy ASR Hip Resurfacing System; the PINNACLE  Acetabular Cup System; pelvic meshes; RISPERDAL  ; XARELTO  ; body powders containing talc, primarily JOHNSONS  Baby Powder; and INVOKANA  . As of December 31, 2017 , in the U.S. there were approximately 2,000 plaintiffs with direct claims in pending lawsuits regarding injuries allegedly due to the DePuy ASR XL Acetabular System and DePuy ASR Hip Resurfacing System, 10,000 with respect to the PINNACLE  Acetabular Cup System, 53,600 with respect to pelvic meshes, 13,700 with respect to RISPERDAL  , 22,900 with respect to XARELTO  , 6,610 with respect to body powders containing talc; and 1,100 with respect to INVOKANA  . In August 2010, DePuy Orthopaedics, Inc. (DePuy) announced a worldwide voluntary recall of its ASR  XL Acetabular System and DePuy ASR  Hip Resurfacing System used in hip replacement surgery. Claims for personal injury have been made against DePuy and Johnson  Johnson. The number of pending lawsuits is expected to fluctuate as certain lawsuits are settled or dismissed and additional lawsuits are filed. Cases filed in federal courts in the United States have been organized as a multi-district litigation in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Ohio. Litigation has also been filed in countries outside of the United States, primarily in the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, Ireland, Germany and Italy. In November 2013, DePuy reached an agreement with a Court-appointed committee of lawyers representing ASR Hip System plaintiffs to establish a program to settle claims with eligible ASR Hip patients in the United States who had surgery to replace their ASR Hips, known as revision surgery, as of August 31, 2013. DePuy reached additional agreements in February 2015 and March 2017, which further extended the settlement program to include ASR Hip patients who had revision surgeries after August 31, 2013 and prior to February 15, 2017. This settlement program has resolved more than 10,000 claims, with more expected from the recent extension, therefore bringing to resolution significant ASR Hip litigation activity in the United States. However, lawsuits in the United States remain, and the settlement program does not address litigation outside of the United States. In Australia, a class action settlement was reached that resolved the claims of the majority of ASR Hip patients in that country. The Company continues to receive information with respect to potential additional costs associated with this recall on a worldwide basis. The Company has established accruals for the costs associated with the United States settlement program and DePuy ASR  Hip-related product liability litigation. Claims for personal injury have also been made against DePuy Orthopaedics, Inc. and Johnson  Johnson relating to the PINNACLE  Acetabular Cup System used in hip replacement surgery. The number of pending product liability lawsuits continues to increase, and the Company continues to receive information with respect to potential costs and the anticipated number of cases. Cases filed in federal courts in the United States have been organized as a multi-district litigation in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Texas. Litigation has also been filed in some state courts and in countries outside of the United States, primarily in the United Kingdom. In the United Kingdom, a trial is ongoing regarding common issues of liability and a decision is expected in the first half of 2018. The Company has established an accrual for defense costs in connection with product liability litigation associated with the PINNACLE  Acetabular Cup System. Claims for personal injury have been made against Ethicon, Inc. (Ethicon) and Johnson  Johnson arising out of Ethicon's pelvic mesh devices used to treat stress urinary incontinence and pelvic organ prolapse. The Company continues to receive information with respect to potential costs and additional cases. Cases filed in federal courts in the United States have been organized as a multi-district litigation in the United States District Court for the Southern District of West Virginia. The Company has settled or otherwise resolved a majority of the United States cases and the costs associated with these settlements are reflected in the Company's accruals. In addition, class actions and individual personal injury cases or claims have been commenced in various countries outside of the United States, including claims and cases in the United Kingdom, the Netherlands and Belgium, and class actions in Israel, Australia and Canada, seeking damages for alleged injury resulting from Ethicon's pelvic mesh devices. In Australia, a trial of class action issues is ongoing and a decision is expected in 2018. The Company has established accruals with respect to product liability litigation associated with Ethicon's pelvic mesh products. Claims for personal injury have been made against Janssen Pharmaceuticals, Inc. and Johnson  Johnson arising out of the use of RISPERDAL  , indicated for the treatment of schizophrenia, acute manic or mixed episodes associated with bipolar I disorder and irritability associated with autism, and related compounds. Lawsuits have been primarily filed in state courts in Pennsylvania, California, and Missouri. Other actions are pending in various courts in the United States and Canada.

The Company has established an accrual with respect to product liability litigation associated with INVOKANA  . INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY Certain subsidiaries of Johnson  Johnson are subject, from time to time, to legal proceedings and claims related to patent, trademark and other intellectual property matters arising out of their businesses. Many of these matters involve challenges to the coverage and/or validity of the patents on various products and allegations that certain of the Companys products infringe the patents of third parties. Although these subsidiaries believe that they have substantial defenses to these challenges and allegations with respect to all significant patents, there can be no assurance as to the outcome of these matters. A loss in any of these cases could adversely affect the ability of these subsidiaries to sell their products, result in loss of sales due to loss of market exclusivity, require the payment of past damages and future royalties, and may result in a non-cash impairment charge for any associated intangible asset. The most significant of these matters are described below. Medical Devices In June 2009, Rembrandt Vision Technologies, L.P. (Rembrandt) filed a patent infringement lawsuit against Johnson  Johnson Vision Care, Inc. (JJVCI) in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Texas alleging that JJVCI's manufacture and sale of its ACUVUE  ADVANCE and ACUVUE OASYS  Hydrogel Contact Lenses infringed Rembrandts United States Patent No. 5,712,327 and seeking monetary relief. The case was transferred to the United States District Court for the Middle District of Florida, where a trial in May 2012 resulted in a verdict of non-infringement that was subsequently upheld on appeal. In July 2014, Rembrandt sought a new trial based on alleged new evidence, which the District Court denied. In April 2016, the Court of Appeals overturned that ruling and remanded the case to the District Court for a new trial. A new trial was held in August 2017, and the jury returned a verdict of non-infringement in favor of JJVCI. Rembrandt has appealed the verdict to the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. In March 2013, Medinol Ltd. (Medinol) filed a patent infringement lawsuit against Cordis Corporation (Cordis) and Johnson  Johnson in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York alleging that Cordiss sales of the CYPHER  and CYPHER SELECT  stents made in the United States since 2005 willfully infringed four of Medinol's patents directed to the geometry of articulated stents. Medinol is seeking damages and attorneys fees. After trial in January 2014, the District Court dismissed the case, finding Medinol unreasonably delayed bringing its claims (the laches defense). In September 2014,  ##TABLE_START  ##TABLE_END the District Court denied a motion by Medinol to vacate the judgment and grant it a new trial. Medinol appealed the decision to the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, then dismissed the appeal in order to file a petition for review with the United States Supreme Court. In March 2017, the United States Supreme Court held that the laches defense is not available in patent cases and remanded this case to the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit to consider Medinol's appeal of whether Medinol is entitled to seek a new trial. Cordis was divested in 2015, and the Company retained any liability that may result from this case. In November 2016, MedIdea, L.L.C. (MedIdea) filed a patent infringement lawsuit against DePuy Orthopaedics, Inc. in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois alleging infringement by the ATTUNE  Knee System. MedIdea alleges infringement of United States Patent Nos. 6,558,426 (426); 8,273,132; 8,721,730 and 9,492,280 relating to posterior stabilized knee systems. Specifically, MedIdea alleges that the SOFCAM TM Contact feature of the ATTUNE  posterior stabilized knee products infringes the patents-in-suit. MedIdea is seeking monetary damages and injunctive relief. In June 2017, the case was transferred to the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts. In December 2017, DePuy Synthes Products, Inc. filed a Petition for Inter Partes Review with the United States Patent and Trademark Office, seeking to invalidate the 426 patent. In December 2016, Ethicon Endo-Surgery, Inc. and Ethicon Endo-Surgery, LLC (now known as Ethicon LLC) sued Covidien, Inc. in the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts seeking a declaration that United States Patent Nos. 6,585,735 (the 735 patent); 7,118,587; 7,473,253; 8,070,748 and 8,241,284 (the 284 patent), are either invalid or not infringed by Ethicons ENSEAL  X1 Large Jaw Tissue Sealer product. In April 2017, Covidien LP, Covidien Sales LLC, and Covidien AG (collectively, Covidien) answered and counterclaimed, denying the allegations, asserting willful infringement of the 735 patent, the 284 patent and United States Patent Nos. 8,323,310; 9,084,608; 9,241,759 and 9,113,882, and seeking damages and an injunction. Covidien filed a motion for preliminary injunction, which was denied in October 2017. Trial is scheduled for September, 2019. In November 2017, Board of Regents, The University of Texas System and Tissuegen, Inc. filed a lawsuit in the United States District Court for the Western District of Texas against Ethicon, Inc. and Ethicon US, LLC alleging the manufacture and sale of VICRYL  Plus Antibacterial Sutures and MONOCRYL  Plus Antibacterial Sutures infringe plaintiffs United States Patent Nos. 6,596,296 and 7,033,603 directed to implantable polymer drug releasing biodegradable fibers containing a therapeutic agent. Pharmaceutical In April 2016, MorphoSys AG, a German biotech company, filed a patent infringement lawsuit against Janssen Biotech, Inc. (JBI), Genmab U.S. Inc. and Genmab A/S (collectively, Genmab) in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware. MorphoSys alleges that JBIs manufacture and sale of DARZALEX  (daratumumab) willfully infringes MorphoSys United States Patent Nos. 8,263,746, 9,200,061 and 9,785,590. MorphoSys is seeking money damages. JBI licenses patents and the commercial rights to DARZALEX  from Genmab. Trial in the case is scheduled to commence in February 2019. In August 2016, Sandoz Ltd and Hexal AG (collectively, Sandoz) filed a lawsuit in the English High Court against G.D. Searle LLC (a Pfizer company) and Janssen Sciences Ireland UC (JSI) alleging that Searles supplementary protection certificate SPC/GB07/038 (SPC), which is exclusively licensed to JSI, is invalid and should be revoked. Janssen-Cilag Limited sells PREZISTA  (darunavir) in the United Kingdom pursuant to this license. In October 2016, Searle and JSI counterclaimed against Sandoz for threatened infringement of the SPC based on statements of its plans to launch generic darunavir in the United Kingdom. Sandoz admitted that its generic darunavir product would infringe the SPC if it is found valid. Searle and JSI are seeking an order enjoining Sandoz from marketing its generic darunavir before the expiration of the SPC. Following a trial in April 2017, the Court entered a decision holding that the SPC is valid and granting a final injunction. Sandoz has appealed the Courts decision and the injunction will be stayed pending the appeal. In January 2018, the Court referred the issue on appeal to the Court of Justice for the European Union (CJEU) and stayed the proceedings pending the CJEUs ruling on the issue. REMICADE  Related Cases United States Proceedings In September 2013, Janssen Biotech, Inc. (JBI) and NYU Langone Medical Center (NYU) received an Office Action from the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) rejecting the claims in United States Patent No. 6,284,471 relating to REMICADE  (infliximab) (the 471 patent) in a reexamination proceeding instituted by a third party. The 471 patent expires in September 2018 and is co-owned by JBI and NYU, with NYU having granted JBI an exclusive license to NYUs rights under the patent. Following several office actions by the patent examiner, including two further rejections, and responses by  ##TABLE_START  ##TABLE_END JBI, the USPTO issued a further action maintaining its rejection of the 471 patent. JBI filed a notice of appeal to the USPTOs Patent Trial and Appeal Board (the Board), which issued a decision in November 2016 upholding the examiner's rejection. In January 2018, the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit affirmed the Board's decision. In August 2014, Celltrion Healthcare Co. Ltd. and Celltrion Inc. (collectively, Celltrion) filed an application with the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for approval to make and sell its own infliximab biosimilar. In March 2015, JBI filed a lawsuit in the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts against Celltrion and Hospira Healthcare Corporation (Hospira), which has exclusive marketing rights for Celltrion's infliximab biosimilar in the United States, seeking, among other things, a declaratory judgment that their biosimilar product infringes or potentially infringes several JBI patents, including the 471 patent and United States Patent No. 7,598,083 (the 083 patent). In August 2016, the District Court granted both Celltrion's and Hospira's motions for summary judgment of invalidity of the 471 patent. JBI appealed those decisions to the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. In January 2018, the Federal Circuit dismissed the appeal as moot based on its affirmance of the Boards reexamination decision. In June 2016, JBI filed two additional patent infringement lawsuits asserting the 083 patent, one against Celltrion and Hospira in the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts and the other against HyClone Laboratories, Inc., the manufacturer of the cell culture media that Celltrion uses to make its biosimilar product, in the United States District Court for the District of Utah. Although the 083 patent is already asserted in the existing lawsuit against Celltrion, the additional lawsuit expands the claims to include the sale in the United States of Celltrion's biosimilar product manufactured with cell culture media made in the United States. This additional lawsuit against Celltrion has been consolidated with the existing lawsuit discussed above. Hospira has moved to dismiss all counts of the lawsuit related to the 083 patent as to it. Celltrion's motion to dismiss all counts of the lawsuit related to the 083 patent for failure to join all the co-owners of the '083 patent as plaintiffs was denied in October 2017. Trial is scheduled to begin in July 2018. The litigation against HyClone in Utah is stayed pending the outcome of the Massachusetts actions. The FDA approved Celltrions infliximab biosimilar for sale in the United States in April 2016. Hospira's parent company, Pfizer Inc., launched Celltrion's infliximab biosimilar in the United States in late 2016. In April 2017, JBI received notice that the FDA approved a marketing application submitted by Samsung Bioepis Co. Ltd. (Samsung) for the sale of its infliximab biosimilar in the United States. In May 2017, JBI filed a patent infringement lawsuit against Samsung in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey alleging that the sale of its biosimilar product may infringe three of JBIs patents. In July 2017, Samsung launched its biosimilar product (commercialized by Merck) in the United States. In November 2017, JBI voluntarily dismissed this lawsuit. Litigation Against Filers of Abbreviated New Drug Applications (ANDAs) The following summarizes lawsuits pending against generic companies that have filed Abbreviated New Drug Applications (ANDAs) with the FDA, or undertaken similar regulatory processes outside of the United States, seeking to market generic forms of products sold by various subsidiaries of Johnson  Johnson prior to expiration of the applicable patents covering those products. These ANDAs typically include allegations of non-infringement, invalidity and unenforceability of the applicable patents. In the event the subsidiaries are not successful in these actions, or the statutory 30-month stays of the ANDAs expire before the United States District Court rulings are obtained, the third-party companies involved will have the ability, upon approval of the FDA, to introduce generic versions of the products at issue to the market, resulting in the potential for substantial market share and revenue losses for those products, and which may result in a non-cash impairment charge in any associated intangible asset. In addition, from time to time, subsidiaries may settle these actions and such settlements can involve the introduction of generic versions of the products at issue to the market prior to the expiration of the relevant patents. The inter partes review (IPR) process with the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO), created under the 2011 America Invents Act, is also being used by generic companies in conjunction with these ANDAs and lawsuits to challenge patents held by the Companys subsidiaries. ZYTIGA   In July 2015, Janssen Biotech, Inc., Janssen Oncology, Inc. and Janssen Research  Development, LLC (collectively, Janssen) and BTG International Ltd. (BTG) initiated a patent infringement lawsuit in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey against a number of generic companies (and certain of their affiliates and/or suppliers) who filed ANDAs seeking approval to market a generic version of ZYTIGA  250mg before the expiration of United States Patent No. 8,822,438 (the 438 patent). The generic companies currently include Amneal Pharmaceuticals, LLC and Amneal Pharmaceuticals of New York, LLC (collectively, Amneal); Apotex Inc. and Apotex Corp. (collectively, Apotex); Citron Pharma LLC (Citron); Dr. Reddys Laboratories, Ltd. and Dr. Reddys Laboratories, Inc. (collectively, Dr. Reddys); Mylan Pharmaceuticals Inc. and Mylan Inc.  ##TABLE_START  ##TABLE_END (collectively, Mylan); Par Pharmaceuticals, Inc. and Par Pharmaceutical Companies, Inc. (collectively, Par); Sun Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd. and Sun Pharmaceuticals Industries, Inc. (collectively, Sun); Teva Pharmaceuticals USA, Inc. (Teva); Wockhardt Bio A.G.; Wockhardt USA LLC and Wockhardt Ltd. (collectively, Wockhardt); West-Ward Pharmaceutical Corp. (West-Ward) and Hikma Pharmaceuticals, LLC (Hikma). In February 2018, the court heard oral arguments on a motion for summary judgment of non-infringement filed by certain defendants. The parties await a decision. If the decision is unfavorable, the stay could be lifted and a generic version of ZYTIGA  could enter the market. Janssen and BTG also initiated patent infringement lawsuits in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey against Amerigen Pharmaceuticals Limited (Amerigen) in May 2016, and Glenmark Pharmaceuticals, Inc. in June 2016, each of whom filed an ANDA seeking approval to market its generic version of ZYTIGA  before the expiration of the 438 patent.  In August 2015, Janssen and BTG filed an additional jurisdictional protective lawsuit against the Mylan defendants in the United States District Court for the Northern District of West Virginia, which has been stayed. In August 2017, Janssen and BTG initiated a patent infringement lawsuit in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey against Teva, who filed an ANDA seeking approval to market a generic version of ZYTIGA  500mg before the expiration of the 438 patent. In January 2018, Janssen dismissed its lawsuit against Sun after it withdrew its ANDA. In each of the above lawsuits, Janssen is seeking an order enjoining the defendants from marketing their generic versions of ZYTIGA  before the expiration of the 438 patent. Several generic companies including Amerigen, Argentum Pharmaceuticals LLC (Argentum), Mylan, Wockhardt, Actavis, Amneal, Dr. Reddys, Sun, Teva, West-Ward and Hikma filed Petitions for Inter Partes Review (IPR) with the USPTO, seeking to invalidate the 438 patent. In January 2018, the USPTO issued decisions invalidating the '438 patent, and Janssen is appealing this decision. The IPR decisions are not binding on the district court in the pending litigation. In October 2017, Janssen Inc. and Janssen Oncology, Inc. (collectively, Janssen) initiated two Notices of Application under Section 6 of the Patented Medicines (Notice of Compliance) Regulations against Teva Canada Limited (Teva) and the Minister of Health in Canada in response to Teva's filing Abbreviated New Drug Submissions (ANDS) and seeking approval to market generic versions of ZYTIGA  250mg and ZYTIGA  500mg before the expiration of Canadian Patent No. 2,661,422. In November 2017, Janssen initiated a Notice of Application under Section 6 of the Patented Medicines (Notice of Compliance) Regulations against Apotex Inc. (Apotex) and the Minister of Health in Canada in response to Apotexs filing of an Abbreviated New Drug Submission (ANDS) seeking approval to market a generic version of ZYTIGA  before the expiration of Canadian Patent No. 2,661,422. In each of these Notices of Application, Janssen is seeking an order prohibiting the Minister of Health from issuing a Notice of Compliance with respect to Teva's and Apotex's ANDS before the expiration of Janssen's patent.

In July 2017, the West Virginia lawsuit was dismissed without prejudice by stipulation of the parties. In the Delaware lawsuit, Janssen and Gilead amended their complaint to add claims for patent infringement with respect to United States Patent Nos. 8,080,551; 7,399,856; 7,563,922; 8,101,752 and 8,618,291. In November 2017, the parties entered into a settlement agreement. XARELTO   B eginning in October 2015, Janssen Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (JPI) and Bayer Pharma AG and Bayer Intellectual Property GmbH (collectively, Bayer) filed patent infringement lawsuits in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware against a number of generic companies who filed ANDAs seeking approval to market generic versions of XARELTO  before expiration  ##TABLE_START  ##TABLE_END of Bayers United States Patent Nos. 7,157,456 , 7,585,860 and 7,592,339 relating to XARELTO  .

Aurobindo, Taro, Torrent and Micro have agreed to have their cases stayed and to be bound by the outcome of any final judgment rendered against any of the other defendants. The 218 cases have been consolidated for discovery and trial, and are currently set for trial in April 2019.

GOVERNMENT PROCEEDINGS Like other companies in the pharmaceutical and medical devices industries, Johnson  Johnson and certain of its subsidiaries are subject to extensive regulation by national, state and local government agencies in the United States and other countries in which they operate. As a result, interaction with government agencies is ongoing. The most significant litigation brought by, and investigations conducted by, government agencies are listed below. It is possible that criminal charges and substantial fines and/or civil penalties or damages could result from government investigations or litigation. Average Wholesale Price (AWP) Litigation Johnson  Johnson and several of its pharmaceutical subsidiaries (the JJ AWP Defendants), along with numerous other pharmaceutical companies, were named as defendants in a series of lawsuits in state and federal courts involving allegations that the pricing and marketing of certain pharmaceutical products amounted to fraudulent and otherwise actionable conduct because, among other things, the companies allegedly reported an inflated Average Wholesale Price (AWP) for the drugs at issue. Payors alleged that they used those AWPs in calculating provider reimbursement levels. The plaintiffs in these cases included three classes of private persons or entities that paid for any portion of the purchase of the drugs at issue based on AWP, and state government entities that made Medicaid payments for the drugs at issue based on AWP. Many of these cases, both federal actions and state actions removed to federal court, were consolidated for pre-trial purposes in a multi-district litigation in the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts, where all claims against the JJ AWP Defendants were ultimately dismissed. The JJ AWP Defendants also prevailed in a case brought by the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. Other AWP cases have been resolved through court order or settlement. Two cases remain pending. In a case brought by Illinois, the parties are awaiting assignment of a trial date. In New Jersey, a putative class action based upon AWP allegations is pending against Centocor, Inc. and Ortho Biotech Inc. (both now Janssen Biotech, Inc.), Johnson  Johnson and ALZA Corporation. Opioids Litigation Beginning in 2014 and continuing to the present, Johnson  Johnson and Janssen Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (JPI), along with other pharmaceutical companies, have been named in numerous lawsuits brought by certain state and local governments related to the marketing of opioids, including DURAGESIC  , NUCYNTA  and NUCYNTA  ER. To date, complaints against pharmaceutical companies, including Johnson  Johnson and JPI, have been filed in state court by the state Attorneys General in Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri, New Mexico, Ohio and Oklahoma. Complaints against the manufacturers also have been filed in state or federal court by city, county and local government agencies in the following states: Arkansas; California; Connecticut; Florida; Georgia; Illinois; Kentucky; Louisiana; Mississippi; Missouri; Nevada; New Hampshire; New Jersey; New Mexico; New York; Ohio; Oklahoma; Oregon; Pennsylvania; Tennessee; Texas; Washington and West Virginia. These actions allege a variety of claims related to opioids marketing practices, including false advertising, unfair competition, public nuisance, consumer fraud violations, deceptive acts and practices, false claims and unjust enrichment. The suits generally seek penalties and/or injunctive and monetary relief. These cases are in early stages of litigation. In October 2017, Johnson  Johnson and JPI were both served with a motion to consolidate 66 pending matters into a federal Multi District Litigation in the Southern District of Ohio. In December 2017, the MDL was approved in the Northern District of Ohio and there are approximately 190 cases that have been transferred to the MDL.  ##TABLE_START  ##TABLE_END Johnson  Johnson, JPI and other pharmaceutical companies have also received subpoenas or requests for information related to opioids marketing practices from the following state Attorneys General: Alaska, Indiana, New Hampshire, New Jersey, Tennessee and Washington. In September 2017, Johnson  Johnson and JPI were contacted by the Texas and Colorado Attorney Generals Offices on behalf of approximately 38 states regarding a multi-state Attorney General investigation. The multi-state coalition served Johnson  Johnson and JPI with subpoenas as part of the investigation. Johnson  Johnson and JPI have also received requests for information from the ranking minority member of the United States Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs regarding the sales, marketing, and educational strategies related to the promotion of opioids use. Other In August 2012, DePuy Orthopaedics, Inc., DePuy, Inc. (now DePuy Synthes, Inc.), and Johnson  Johnson Services, Inc. received an informal request from the United States Attorney's Office for the District of Massachusetts and the Civil Division of the United States Department of Justice (the United States) for the production of materials relating to the DePuy ASR XL Hip device. In July 2014, the United States notified the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts that it had declined to intervene in a qui tam case filed pursuant to the False Claims Act against the companies. In February 2016, the District Court granted the companies motion to dismiss with prejudice, unsealed the qui tam complaint, and denied the qui tam relators request for leave to file a further amended complaint. The qui tam relators appealed the case to the United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit. In July 2017, the First Circuit affirmed the District Courts dismissal in part, reversed in part, and affirmed the decision to deny the relators request to file a third amended complaint. The relators remaining claims are now pending before the District Court. Since October 2013, a group of State Attorneys General have issued Civil Investigative Demands relating to the development, sales and marketing of several of DePuy Orthopaedics, Inc.'s hip products. The states are seeking monetary and injunctive relief, and DePuy Orthopaedics, Inc. has entered into a tolling agreement with the states. In July 2014, the Oregon Department of Justice, which was investigating these matters independently of the other states, announced a settlement of its ASR XL Hip device investigation  with the State of Oregon. In October 2012, Johnson  Johnson was contacted by the California Attorney General's office regarding a multi-state Attorney General investigation of the marketing of surgical mesh products for hernia and urogynecological purposes by Johnson  Johnson's subsidiary, Ethicon, Inc. (Ethicon). Johnson  Johnson and Ethicon have since entered into a series of tolling agreements with the 47 states and the District of Columbia participating in the multi-state investigation and have responded to Civil Investigative Demands served by certain of the participating states. The states are seeking monetary and injunctive relief. In May 2016, California and Washington filed civil complaints against Johnson  Johnson, Ethicon Inc. and Ethicon US, LLC alleging violations of their consumer protection statutes. Similar complaints were filed against the companies by Kentucky in August 2016 and by Mississippi in October 2017. Johnson  Johnson and Ethicon have entered into a new tolling agreement with the remaining 43 states and the District of Columbia. In December 2012, Therakos, Inc. (Therakos), formerly a subsidiary of Johnson  Johnson and part of the Ortho-Clinical Diagnostics, Inc. (OCD) franchise, received a letter from the civil division of the United States Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania informing Therakos that the United States Attorney's Office was investigating the sales and marketing of Uvadex  (methoxsalen) and the Uvar Xts  and Cellex  Systems during the period 2000 to the present. The United States Attorney's Office requested that OCD and Johnson  Johnson preserve documents that could relate to the investigation. Therakos was subsequently acquired by an affiliate of Gores Capital Partners III, L.P. in January 2013, and OCD was divested in June 2014. Following the divestiture of OCD, Johnson  Johnson retains OCDs portion of any liability that may result from the investigation for activity that occurred prior to the sale of Therakos. In March 2014 and March 2016, the United States Attorneys Office requested that Johnson  Johnson produce certain documents, and Johnson  Johnson is cooperating with those requests. In June 2014, the Mississippi Attorney General filed a complaint in Chancery Court of The First Judicial District of Hinds County, Mississippi against Johnson  Johnson and Johnson  Johnson Consumer Companies, Inc. (now Johnson  Johnson Consumer Inc.) (JJCI). The complaint alleges that defendants failed to disclose alleged health risks associated with female consumers' use of talc contained in JOHNSON'S  Baby Powder and JOHNSON'S  Shower to Shower (a product no longer sold by JJCI) and seeks injunctive and monetary relief. The parties have agreed to adjourn the trial date and currently expect the trial to be re-scheduled to the fall of 2018. In March 2016, Janssen Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (JPI) received a Civil Investigative Demand from the United States Attorneys Office for the Southern District of New York related to JPIs contractual relationships with pharmacy benefit managers over the  ##TABLE_START  ##TABLE_END period from January 1, 2006 to the present with regard to certain of JPI's pharmaceutical products.

At this time, the federal and state governments have declined to intervene and the lawsuit, which is related to the Civil Investigative Demand, is being prosecuted by a former company employee. JPI filed a motion to dismiss in the United States District Court for the Central District of California in January 2018. In February 2017, Johnson  Johnson received a subpoena from the United States Attorney's Office for the District of Massachusetts seeking the production of records pertaining to payments to any 501(c)(3) charitable organization that provides financial assistance to Medicare patients. Multiple pharmaceutical companies have publicly reported receipt of subpoenas and ongoing inquiries similar to this one and the one described below. Actelion Pharmaceuticals US, Inc. (Actelion US), received a subpoena in May 2016, with follow-up requests in June and December 2016, from the United States Attorney's Office for the District of Massachusetts.

From time to time, Johnson  Johnson has received requests from a variety of United States Congressional Committees to produce information relevant to ongoing congressional inquiries. It is the policy of Johnson  Johnson to cooperate with these inquiries by producing the requested information. GENERAL LITIGATION In June 2009, following the public announcement that Ortho-Clinical Diagnostics, Inc. (OCD) had received a grand jury subpoena from the United States Department of Justice, Antitrust Division, in connection with an investigation that has since been closed, multiple class action complaints were filed against OCD by direct purchasers seeking damages for alleged price fixing. These cases were consolidated for pre-trial purposes in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania as In re Blood Reagent Antitrust Litigation. Following the appeal and reversal of its initial grant of a motion for class certification, on remand, the District Court in October 2015 again granted a motion by the plaintiffs for class certification. In July 2017, the Court issued an opinion granting in part and denying in part OCD's motion for summary judgment. The Court granted summary judgment concerning allegations of price fixing in 2005 and 2008, and denied summary judgment concerning allegations of price fixing in 2001. Trial has been set for June 2018. OCD was divested in 2014 and Johnson  Johnson retained any liability that may result from these cases. In June 2011, DePuy Orthopaedics, Inc. (DePuy) filed suit against Orthopaedic Hospital (OH) in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Indiana seeking a declaratory judgment that DePuy did not owe OH royalties under a 1999 development agreement.

In February 2014, OH brought suit for patent infringement relating to the same technology, and that action was also consolidated with the Indiana case. In August 2017, the court denied DePuys motions for summary judgment. A trial date has not been set.  ##TABLE_START  ##TABLE_END In September 2011, Johnson  Johnson, Johnson  Johnson Inc. and McNeil Consumer Healthcare Division of Johnson  Johnson Inc. received a Notice of Civil Claim filed by Nick Field in the Supreme Court of British Columbia, Canada (the BC Civil Claim). The BC Civil Claim is a putative class action brought on behalf of persons who reside in British Columbia and who purchased during the period between September 20, 2001 and in or about December 2010 one or more various McNeil infants' or children's over-the-counter medicines that were manufactured at the Fort Washington, Pennsylvania facility. The BC Civil Claim alleges that the defendants violated the BC Business Practices and Consumer Protection Act, and other Canadian statutes and common laws, by selling medicines that were allegedly not safe and/or effective or did not comply with Canadian Good Manufacturing Practices. The class certification hearing scheduled for October 2015 was adjourned, and the Court entered a Consent Order of Dismissal in November 2017 concluding this action.

Restructuring The Company announced restructuring actions in its Medical Devices segment to better serve the needs of patients and customers in todays evolving healthcare marketplace. The Company is undertaking actions to strengthen its go-to-market model, accelerate the pace of innovation, further prioritize key platforms and geographies, and streamline operations while maintaining high quality standards. The Company estimates that, in connection with its plans, it will record pre-tax restructuring related charges of approximately $2.0 billion to $2.4 billion . In 2017, the Company recorded a pre-tax charge of $760 million , of which $88 million was included in cost of products sold and $363 million was included in other (income) expense. See table below for additional details. Total project costs of $2.0 billion have been recorded since the restructuring has been announced. Additionally, as part of the plan, the Company expects that the restructuring actions will result in position eliminations of approximately 4 to 6 percent of the Medical Devices segments global workforce over the next 15 months . Approximately 2,400 positions have been eliminated of which 1,700 received separation payments since the restructuring announcement. The Company estimates that approximately one-half of the cumulative pre-tax costs will result in cash outlays, including approximately $400 million of employee severance.

We also have audited the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2017, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).  In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2017  and January 1, 2017 , and the results of its  operations and its  cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2017  in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of  December 31, 2017  based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework  (2013)  issued by the COSO. Change in Accounting Principle As discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company changed the manner in which it accounts for and presents certain elements of share based payments in 2016. Basis for Opinions The Company's management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management's Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express opinions on the Companys consolidated financial statements and on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (\"PCAOB\") and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions. As described in Managements Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting, management has excluded Abbott Medical Optics and Actelion Ltd. from its assessment of internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2017, because they were acquired by the Company in purchase business combinations during 2017. We have also excluded Abbott Medical Optics and Actelion Ltd. from our audit of internal control over financial reporting. Abbott Medical Optics and Actelion Ltd. are wholly-owned subsidiaries whose total assets and total revenues excluded from managements assessment and our audit of internal control over financial reporting represent approximately 1% and 1% of total assets, respectively and approximately 1% and 2% of total revenues, respectively, of the related consolidated financial statement amounts as of and for the year ended December 31, 2017.  ##TABLE_START  ##TABLE_END Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting A companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. /s/ PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP Florham Park, New Jersey February 21, 2018 We have served as the Companys auditor since at least 1920. We have not determined the specific year we began serving as auditor of the Company.  ##TABLE_START  ##TABLE_END Managements Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting Under Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, management is required to assess the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting as of the end of each fiscal year and report, based on that assessment, whether the Companys internal control over financial reporting is effective. Management of the Company is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. The Companys internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance as to the reliability of the Companys financial reporting and the preparation of external financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Internal controls over financial reporting, no matter how well designed, have inherent limitations. Therefore, internal control over financial reporting determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and may not prevent or detect all misstatements. Moreover, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. The Companys management has assessed the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2017. In making this assessment, the Company used the criteria established by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013). These criteria are in the areas of control environment, risk assessment, control activities, information and communication, and monitoring. The Companys assessment included extensive documenting, evaluating and testing the design and operating effectiveness of its internal controls over financial reporting. The Company acquired Abbott Medical Optics (AMO), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Abbott Laboratories and Actelion Ltd. and its consolidated subsidiaries (Actelion) in February and June 2017, respectively. Actelion's total assets, excluding intangible assets and goodwill, and total revenues represented approximately 1% and 2%, respectively, of the related consolidated financial statements as of and for the period ended December 31, 2017. AMO's total assets, excluding intangible assets and goodwill, and total revenues represented approximately 1% and 1%, respectively, of the related consolidated financial statements as of and for the period ended December 31, 2017. As the acquisitions occurred in the fiscal year 2017, the scope of the Company's assessment of the design and effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting for the fiscal year 2017 excluded the above mentioned acquisitions. This exclusion is in accordance with the SEC's general guidance that an assessment of a recently acquired business may be omitted from the scope in the year of acquisition. Based on the Companys processes and assessment, as described above, management has concluded that, as of December 31, 2017, the Companys internal control over financial reporting was effective. The effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2017 has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report, which appears herein. ##TABLE_START /s/ Alex Gorsky  /s/ Dominic J.

CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES ##TABLE_END Disclosure Controls and Procedures. At the end of the period covered by this Report, the Company evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of its disclosure controls and procedures. The Companys disclosure controls and procedures are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SECs rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the Companys management, including its principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Alex Gorsky, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, and Dominic J. Caruso, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, reviewed and participated in this evaluation. Based on this evaluation, Messrs. Gorsky and Caruso concluded that, as of the end of the period covered by this Report, the Companys disclosure controls and procedures were effective Reports on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. The information called for by this item is incorporated herein by reference to \"Managements Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\", and the attestation regarding internal controls over financial reporting included in the \"Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\" included in Item 8 of this Report. Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. During the fiscal quarter ended December 31, 2017, there were no changes in the Companys internal control over financial reporting identified in connection with the evaluation required under Rules 13a-15 and 15d-15 under the Exchange Act that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Companys internal control over financial reporting. The Company is implementing a multi-year, enterprise-wide initiative to integrate, simplify and standardize processes and systems for the human resources, information technology, procurement, supply chain and finance functions. These are enhancements to support the growth of the Companys financial shared service capabilities and standardize financial systems. This initiative is not in response to any identified deficiency or weakness in the Companys internal control over financial reporting. In response to this initiative, the Company has and will continue to align and streamline the design and operation of its financial control environment. ##TABLE_START ", "9B": " Item 9B.

BUSINESS ##TABLE_ENDGeneral Johnson  Johnson and its subsidiaries (the Company) have approximately 135,100 employees worldwide engaged in the research and development, manufacture and sale of a broad range of products in the health care field. Johnson  Johnson is a holding company, which has more than 260 operating companies conducting business in virtually all countries of the world. The Companys primary focus is products related to human health and well-being. Johnson  Johnson was incorporated in the State of New Jersey in 1887. The Executive Committee of Johnson  Johnson is the principal management group responsible for the strategic operations and allocation of the resources of the Company. This Committee oversees and coordinates the activities of the Company's three business segments: Consumer, Pharmaceutical and Medical Devices. Within the strategic parameters provided by the Committee, senior management groups at U.S. and international operating companies are each responsible for their own strategic plans and the day-to-day operations of those companies. Each subsidiary within the business segments is, with limited exceptions, managed by residents of the country where located. Segments of Business The Company is organized into three business segments: Consumer, Pharmaceutical and Medical Devices. Additional information required by this item is incorporated herein by reference to the narrative and tabular descriptions of segments and operating results under: Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition of this Report; and Note 18 Segments of Business and Geographic Areas of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Report. Consumer The Consumer segment includes a broad range of products used in the baby care, oral care, beauty, over-the-counter pharmaceutical, womens health and wound care markets. Baby Care includes the JOHNSONS  line of products. Oral Care includes the LISTERINE  product line. Major brands in Beauty include the AVEENO  ; CLEAN  CLEAR  ; DABAO  ; JOHNSONS  Adult; LE PETITE MARSEILLAIS  ; NEUTROGENA  and OGX  product lines. Over-the-counter medicines include the broad family of TYLENOL  acetaminophen products; SUDAFED  cold, flu and allergy products; BENADRYL  and ZYRTEC  allergy products; MOTRIN  IB ibuprofen products; and the PEPCID  line of acid reflux products. Major brands in Womens Health outside of North America are STAYFREE  and CAREFREE  sanitary pads and o.b.  tampon brands. Wound Care brands include the BAND-AID  Brand Adhesive Bandages and NEOSPORIN  First Aid product lines. These products are marketed to the general public and sold both to retail outlets and distributors throughout the world. Pharmaceutical The Pharmaceutical segment is focused on six therapeutic areas: Immunology (e.g., rheumatoid arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease and psoriasis), Infectious Diseases and Vaccines (e.g., HIV/AIDS), Neuroscience (e.g., mood disorders, neurodegenerative disorders and schizophrenia), Oncology (e.g., prostate cancer and hematologic malignancies), Cardiovascular and Metabolism (e.g., thrombosis and diabetes) and Pulmonary Hypertension (e.g., Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension). Medicines in this segment are distributed directly to retailers, wholesalers, hospitals and health care professionals for prescription use. Key products in the Pharmaceutical segment include: REMICADE  (infliximab), a treatment for a number of immune-mediated inflammatory diseases; SIMPONI  (golimumab), a subcutaneous treatment for adults with moderate to severe rheumatoid arthritis, active psoriatic arthritis, active ankylosing spondylitis and moderately active to severely active ulcerative colitis; SIMPONI ARIA  (golimumab), an intravenous treatment for adults with moderate to severe rheumatoid arthritis, active psoriatic arthritis and active ankylosing spondylitis; STELARA  (ustekinumab), a treatment for adults and children with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis, for adults with active psoriatic arthritis, and for adults with moderately to severely active Crohn's disease; TREMFYA  (guselkumab), a treatment for adults with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis; EDURANT  (rilpivirine), INTELENCE  (etravirine), PREZISTA  (darunavir) and PREZCOBIX  /REZOLSTA  (darunavir/cobicistat), antiretroviral medicines for the treatment of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1) in combination with other antiretroviral products and SYMTUZA  ( darunavir/cobicistat/emtricitabine/tenofovir alafenamide), a once-daily single tablet regimen for the treatment of HIV ; CONCERTA  (methylphenidate HCl) extended-release tablets CII, a treatment for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder; INVEGA SUSTENNA  /XEPLION  (paliperidone palmitate), for the treatment of schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorder in adults; INVEGA TRINZA  /TREVICTA  (paliperidone palmitate), for the treatment of schizophrenia in patients after they have been adequately treated with INVEGA SUSTENNA  for at least four months; RISPERDAL CONSTA  (risperidone long-acting injection), for the treatment of schizophrenia and the maintenance treatment of Bipolar 1 Disorder in adults; ZYTIGA  (abiraterone acetate), a treatment for metastatic castration-  ##TABLE_START  ##TABLE_END resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) and metastatic high-risk castration-sensitive prostate cancer; IMBRUVICA  (ibrutinib), a treatment for certain B-cell malignancies, or blood cancers, chronic graft versus host disease and Waldenstrm's Macroglobulinemia; DARZALEX  (daratumumab), a treatment for relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma; VELCADE  (bortezomib), a treatment for multiple myeloma mantle cell lymphoma; PROCRIT  /EPREX  (epoetin alfa), a treatment for chemotherapy-induced anemia and patients with chronic kidney disease; XARELTO  (rivaroxaban), an oral anticoagulant for the prevention of deep vein thrombosis (DVT), which may lead to pulmonary embolism (PE) in patients undergoing hip or knee replacement surgery, to reduce the risk of stroke and systemic embolism in patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation, and for the treatment and reduction of risk of recurrence of DVT and PE; INVOKANA  (canagliflozin), for the treatment of adults with type 2 diabetes; INVOKAMET  /VOKANAMET  (canagliflozin/metformin HCl), a combination therapy of fixed doses of canagliflozin and metformin hydrochloride for the treatment of adults with type 2 diabetes; and INVOKAMET  XR (canagliflozin/metformin hydrochloride extended-release), a once-daily, fixed-dose combination therapy of canagliflozin and metformin hydrochloride extended-release, for the treatment of adults with type 2 diabetes; OPSUMIT  (macitentan) as monotherapy or in combination, indicated for the long-term treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH); UPTRAVI  (selexipag), the only approved oral, selective IP receptor agonist targeting a prostacyclin pathway in PAH. Many of these medicines were developed in collaboration with strategic partners or are licensed from other companies and maintain active lifecycle development programs. Medical Devices The Medical Devices segment includes a broad range of products used in the orthopaedic, surgery, interventional solutions (cardiovascular and neurovascular), diabetes care (divested in the fiscal fourth quarter of 2018) and eye health fields. These products are distributed to wholesalers, hospitals and retailers, and used principally in the professional fields by physicians, nurses, hospitals, eye care professionals and clinics. They include orthopaedic products; general surgery, biosurgical, endomechanical and energy products; electrophysiology products to treat cardiovascular disease; sterilization and disinfection products to reduce surgical infection; and vision products such as disposable contact lenses and ophthalmic products related to cataract and laser refractive surgery. Geographic Areas The business of Johnson  Johnson is conducted by more than 260 operating companies located in more than 60 countries, including the U.S., which sell products in virtually all countries throughout the world. The products made and sold in the international business include many of those described above under  Segments of Business  Consumer,  Pharmaceutical and  Medical Devices. However, the principal markets, products and methods of distribution in the international business vary with the country and the culture. The products sold in international business include those developed in the U.S. and by subsidiaries abroad. Investments and activities in some countries outside the U.S. are subject to higher risks than comparable U.S. activities because the investment and commercial climate may be influenced by financial instability in international economies, restrictive economic policies and political and legal system uncertainties. Raw Materials Raw materials essential to the Company's business are generally readily available from multiple sources. Where there are exceptions, the temporary unavailability of those raw materials would not likely have a material adverse effect on the financial results of the Company. Patents The Company's subsidiaries have made a practice of obtaining patent protection on their products and processes where possible. They own, or are licensed under, a significant number of patents in the U.S. and other countries relating to their products, product uses, formulations and manufacturing processes, which in the aggregate are believed to be of material importance to the Company in the operation of its businesses. The Companys subsidiaries face patent challenges from third parties, including challenges seeking to manufacture and market generic and biosimilar versions of the Company's key pharmaceutical products prior to expiration of the applicable patents covering those products. Significant legal proceedings and claims involving the Company's patent and other intellectual property are described in Note 21, Legal Proceedings Intellectual Property of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Report. Sales of the Companys 2 nd largest product, STELARA  (ustekinumab), accounted for approximately 6.3% of the Company's total revenues for fiscal 2018. Accordingly, the patents related to this product are believed to be material to the Company. There is one set of granted patents related specifically to STELARA  . This set of patents is owned by Janssen Biotech, Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of Johnson  Johnson. These patents are in force in the U.S. and many countries outside the  ##TABLE_START  ##TABLE_END United States. In the U.S., the latest projected expiration date for patents in this set is 2023 due to a patent term extension. In Europe, the latest projected expiration date for patents in this set is 2024 due to a Supplemental Patent Certificate (patent term extension). In most other countries, the latest projected expiration date is 2021. In addition to competing in the immunology market with STELARA  , the Company is currently marketing SIMPONI  (golimumab) and SIMPONI ARIA  (golimumab), next generation immunology products with remaining patent lives of up to six years. The Company also markets REMICADE  (infliximab) in the immunology market which is the Companys largest product. Patents on this product have expired and the Food and Drug Administration approved the first infliximab biosimilar for sale in the U.S. in 2016, and a number of such products have been launched since then. For a more extensive description of legal matters regarding the patents related to REMICADE  , see Note 21 Legal Proceedings - Intellectual Property - Pharmaceutical - REMICADE  Related Cases of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Report. Trademarks The Companys subsidiaries have made a practice of selling their products under trademarks and of obtaining protection for these trademarks by all available means. These trademarks are protected by registration in the U.S. and other countries where such products are marketed. The Company considers these trademarks in the aggregate to be of material importance in the operation of its businesses. Seasonality Worldwide sales do not reflect any significant degree of seasonality; however, spending has been heavier in the fourth quarter of each year than in other quarters. This reflects increased spending decisions, principally for advertising and research and development activity. Competition In all of their product lines, the Company's subsidiaries compete with companies both locally and globally. Competition exists in all product lines without regard to the number and size of the competing companies involved. Competition in research, both internally and externally sourced, involving the development and the improvement of new and existing products and processes, is particularly significant. The development of new and innovative products, as well as protecting the underlying intellectual property of the Companys product portfolio, is important to the Company's success in all areas of its business. The competitive environment requires substantial investments in continuing research. In addition, the development and maintenance of customer demand for the Companys consumer products involve significant expenditures for advertising and promotion. Environment The Company is subject to a variety of U.S. and international environmental protection measures. The Company believes that its operations comply in all material respects with applicable environmental laws and regulations. The Companys compliance with these requirements did not change during the past year, and is not expected to have a material effect upon its capital expenditures, cash flows, earnings or competitive position. Regulation The Companys businesses are subject to varying degrees of governmental regulation in the countries in which operations are conducted, and the general trend is toward increasingly stringent regulation. In the U.S., the drug, device and cosmetic industries have long been subject to regulation by various federal and state agencies, primarily as to product safety, efficacy, manufacturing, advertising, labeling and safety reporting. The exercise of broad regulatory powers by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (the FDA) continues to result in increases in the amounts of testing and documentation required for FDA approval of new drugs and devices and a corresponding increase in the expense of product introduction. Similar trends are also evident in major markets outside of the U.S. The new medical device regulatory framework and the new privacy regulations in Europe are examples of such increased regulation. The costs of human health care have been and continue to be a subject of study, investigation and regulation by governmental agencies and legislative bodies around the world. In the U.S., attention has been focused on drug prices and profits and programs that encourage doctors to write prescriptions for particular drugs, or to recommend, use or purchase particular medical devices. Payers have become a more potent force in the market place and increased attention is being paid to drug and medical device pricing, appropriate drug and medical device utilization and the quality and costs of health care generally.  ##TABLE_START  ##TABLE_END U.S. government agencies continue to implement the extensive requirements of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (the ACA). These have both positive and negative impacts on the U.S. healthcare industry with much remaining uncertain as to how various provisions of the ACA, and potential modification or repeal of ACA provisions, will ultimately affect the industry. The regulatory agencies under whose purview the Company operates have administrative powers that may subject it to actions such as product withdrawals, recalls, seizure of products and other civil and criminal sanctions. In some cases, the Companys subsidiaries may deem it advisable to initiate product recalls. In addition, business practices in the health care industry have come under increased scrutiny, particularly in the U.S., by government agencies and state attorneys general, and resulting investigations and prosecutions carry the risk of significant civil and criminal penalties. Further, the Company relies on global supply chains, and production and distribution processes, that are complex, are subject to increasing regulatory requirements, and may be faced with unexpected changes such as those resulting from Brexit, that may affect sourcing, supply and pricing of materials used in the Company's products. These processes also are subject to lengthy regulatory approvals. Available Information The Companys main corporate website address is www.jnj.com. All of the Companys SEC filings are also available on the Companys website at www.investor.jnj.com/sec.cfm , as soon as reasonably practicable after having been electronically filed or furnished to the SEC. All SEC filings are also available at the SECs website at www.sec.gov . In addition, the written charters of the Audit Committee, the Compensation  Benefits Committee, the Nominating  Corporate Governance Committee, the Regulatory Compliance Committee and the Science, Technology  Sustainability Committee of the Board of Directors and the Companys Principles of Corporate Governance, Code of Business Conduct (for employees), Code of Business Conduct  Ethics for Members of the Board of Directors and Executive Officers, and other corporate governance materials, are available at www.investor.jnj.com/gov.cfm on the Company's website and will be provided without charge to any shareholder submitting a written request, as provided above. The information on the Companys website is not, and will not be deemed, a part of this Report or incorporated into any other filings the Company makes with the SEC.  ##TABLE_START  ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START ", "1A": " Item 1A. RISK FACTORS ##TABLE_END The Company faces a number of uncertainties and risks that are difficult to predict and many of which are outside of the Company's control. In addition to the other information in this report and the Companys other filings with the SEC, investors should consider carefully the factors set forth below. Investors should be aware that it is not possible to predict or identify all such factors and that the following is not meant to be a complete discussion of all potential risks or uncertainties. If known or unknown risks or uncertainties materialize, the Companys business, results of operations or financial condition could be adversely affected, potentially in a material way. Global sales in the Companys pharmaceutical and medical devices segments may be negatively impacted by healthcare reforms and increasing pricing pressures. Sales of the Companys pharmaceutical and medical device products are significantly affected by reimbursements by third-party payers such as government healthcare programs, private insurance plans and managed care organizations. As part of various efforts to contain healthcare costs, these payers are putting downward pressure on prices at which products will be reimbursed. In the U.S., increased purchasing power of entities that negotiate on behalf of Medicare, Medicaid, and private sector beneficiaries, in part due to continued consolidation among health care providers, could result in further pricing pressures. In addition, increased political scrutiny could result in additional pricing pressures. Outside the U.S., numerous major markets, including the EU and Japan, have pervasive government involvement in funding healthcare and, in that regard, directly or indirectly impose price controls, limit access to, or reimbursement for, the Companys products, or reduce the value of its intellectual property protection. The Company is subject to significant legal proceedings that can result in significant expenses, fines and reputational damage. In the ordinary course of business, Johnson  Johnson and its subsidiaries are subject to numerous claims and lawsuits involving various issues such as patent disputes, product liability and claims that their product sales, marketing and pricing practices violate various antitrust, unfair trade practices and/or consumer protection laws. The most significant of these proceedings are described in Note 21, Legal Proceedings under Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Report. While the Company believes it has substantial defenses in these matters, it is not feasible to predict the ultimate outcome of litigation. The Company could in the future be required to pay significant amounts as a result of settlements or judgments in these matters, potentially in excess of accruals, including matters where the Company could be held jointly and severally liable among other defendants. The resolution of, or increase in accruals for, one or more of these matters in any reporting period could have a material adverse effect on the Company's results of operations and cash flows for that period. Furthermore, as a result of cost and availability factors, effective November 1, 2005, the Company ceased purchasing third-party product liability insurance. Product reliability, safety and effectiveness concerns can have significant negative impacts on sales and results of operations, lead to litigation and cause reputational damage. Concerns about product safety, whether raised internally or by litigants, regulators or consumer advocates, and whether or not based on scientific evidence, can result in safety alerts, product recalls, governmental investigations, regulatory action on the part of the FDA (or its counterpart in other countries), private claims and lawsuits, payment of fines and settlements, declining sales and reputational damage. These circumstances can also result in damage to brand image, brand equity and consumer trust in the Companys products. Product recalls have in the past, and could in the future, prompt government investigations and inspections, the shutdown of manufacturing facilities, continued product shortages and related sales declines, significant remediation costs, reputational damage, possible civil penalties and criminal prosecution. Changes in tax laws or exposures to additional tax liabilities could negatively impact the Companys operating results. Changes in tax laws or regulations around the world could negatively impact the Companys effective tax rate and results of operations. A change in statutory tax rate in any country would result in the revaluation of the Companys deferred tax assets and liabilities related to that particular jurisdiction in the period in which the new tax law is enacted. This change would result in an expense or benefit recorded to the Companys Consolidated Statement of Earnings. The Company closely monitors these proposals as they arise in the countries where it operates. Changes to the statutory tax rate may occur at any time, and any related expense or benefit recorded may be material to the fiscal quarter and year in which the law change is enacted.  On December 22, 2017, the U.S. enacted The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the TCJA), which introduced significant changes to U.S. corporate income tax law that will have a meaningful impact on the Companys provision for income taxes. Accounting for the income tax effects of the TCJA requires significant judgments to be made in interpreting its provisions. Anticipated guidance from the U.S. Treasury about implementing the TCJA, which should be final by June 22, 2019 (18 months after enactment),  ##TABLE_START  ##TABLE_END may result in adjustments that could materially affect the Companys financial position and results of operations as well as the effective tax rate in the period in which the adjustments are made. On September 28, 2018, the Swiss Parliament approved the Federal Act on Tax Reform and AHV Financing (Swiss Tax Reform). However, a referendum has been called and, as a result, a public vote on the Swiss Tax Reform will take place on May 19th, 2019. I f the Swiss Tax Reform passes, then the measures are expected to come into force in either January 2020 or January 2021. Prior to approval in the referendum and its subsequent cantonal implementation, the proposed Swiss Tax Reform is not enacted and therefore the Company has not reflected any of the potential impacts in its fiscal results. The Company is currently assessing the impact of the proposed Swiss Tax Reform, and when enacted, the law may have a material impact on the Companys operating results. The Company conducts business and files tax returns in numerous countries and is addressing tax audits and disputes with many tax authorities. In connection with the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (BEPS) project, companies are required to disclose more information to tax authorities on operations around the world, which may lead to greater audit scrutiny of profits earned in other countries. The Company regularly assesses the likely outcomes of its tax audits and disputes to determine the appropriateness of its tax reserves. However, any tax authority could take a position on tax treatment that is contrary to the Companys expectations, which could result in tax liabilities in excess of reserves. The Company may not be able to successfully secure and defend intellectual property rights essential to the Companys businesses. The Company owns or licenses a significant number of patents and other proprietary rights, determined by patent offices, courts and lawmakers in various countries, relating to its products and manufacturing processes. These rights are essential to the Companys businesses and materially important to the Companys results of operations. Public policy, both within and outside the U.S., has become increasingly unfavorable toward intellectual property rights. The Company cannot be certain that it will obtain adequate patent protection for new products and technologies in the U.S. and other important markets or that such protections, once granted, will last as long as originally anticipated. Competitors routinely challenge the validity or extent of the Companys owned or licensed patents and proprietary rights through litigation, interferences, oppositions and other proceedings. These proceedings absorb resources and can be protracted as well as unpredictable. In addition, challenges that the Companys products infringe the patents of third parties could result in the need to pay past damages and future royalties and adversely affect the competitive position and sales of the products in question. The Company has faced increasing patent challenges from third parties seeking to manufacture and market generic and biosimilar versions of the Company's key pharmaceutical products prior to expiration of the applicable patents covering those products. In the U.S., manufacturers of generic versions of innovative human pharmaceutical products may challenge the validity, or claim non-infringement, of innovator products through the Abbreviated New Drug Application, or ANDA, process with the FDA. The Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act (BPCIA), enacted in 2010, which created a new regulatory pathway for the approval by the FDA of biosimilar alternatives to innovator-developed biological products, also created mechanisms for biosimilar applicants to challenge the patents on the innovator biologics. The inter partes review (IPR) process with the USPTO, created under the 2011 America Invents Act, is also being used by competitors to challenge patents held by the Companys subsidiaries. In the event the Company is not successful in defending its patents against such challenges, or upon the at-risk launch (despite pending patent infringement litigation) by the generic or biosimilar firm of its product, the Company can lose a major portion of revenues for the referenced product in a very short period of time. Current legal proceedings involving the Companys patents and other intellectual property rights are described in Note 21, Legal ProceedingsIntellectual Property of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Report. The Companys businesses operate in highly competitive product markets and competitive pressures could adversely affect the Companys earnings. The Company faces substantial competition in all three operating segments and in all geographic markets. The Companys businesses compete with companies of all sizes on the basis of cost-effectiveness, technological innovations, intellectual property rights, product performance, real or perceived product advantages, pricing and availability and rate of reimbursement. The Company also competes with other market participants in securing rights to acquisitions, collaborations and licensing agreements with third parties. Competition for rights to product candidates and technologies may result in significant investment and acquisition costs and onerous agreement terms for the Company. Competitors development of more effective or  ##TABLE_START  ##TABLE_END less costly products, and/or their ability to secure patent and other intellectual property rights and successfully market products ahead of the Company, could negatively impact sales of the Companys existing products as well as its ability to bring new products to market despite significant prior investment in the related product development. For the Companys pharmaceutical businesses, loss of patent exclusivity for a product often is followed by a substantial reduction in sales as competitors gain regulatory approval for generic and other competing products and enter the market. Similar competition can be triggered by the loss of exclusivity for a biological product. For the Companys medical device businesses, technological innovation, product quality, reputation and customer service are especially important to competitiveness. Development by other companies of new or improved products, processes and technologies could threaten to make the Companys products or technologies less desirable, less economical or obsolete. The Companys consumer businesses face intense competition from other branded products and retailers private-label brands. If the Company fails to sufficiently differentiate and market its brand name consumer products, this could adversely affect revenues and profitability of those products. Significant challenges or delays in the Companys innovation and development of new products, technologies and indications could have an adverse impact on the Companys long-term success. The Companys continued growth and success depends on its ability to innovate and develop new and differentiated products and services that address the evolving health care needs of patients, providers and consumers. Development of successful products and technologies is also necessary to offset revenue losses when the Companys existing products lose market share due to various factors such as competition and loss of patent exclusivity. New products introduced within the past five years accounted for approximately 25% of 2018 sales. The Company cannot be certain when or whether it will be able to develop, license or otherwise acquire companies, products and technologies, whether particular product candidates will be granted regulatory approval, and, if approved, whether the products will be commercially successful. The Company pursues product development through internal research and development as well as through collaborations, acquisitions, joint ventures and licensing or other arrangements with third parties. In all of these contexts, developing new products, particularly pharmaceutical and biotechnology products and medical devices, requires significant investment of resources over many years. Only a very few biopharmaceutical research and development programs result in commercially viable products. The process depends on many factors including the ability to discern patients and health care providers future needs; develop promising new compounds, strategies and technologies; achieve successful clinical trial results; secure effective intellectual property protection; obtain regulatory approvals on a timely basis; and, if and when they reach the market, successfully differentiate the Companys products from competing products and approaches to treatment. New products or enhancements to existing products may not be accepted quickly or significantly in the marketplace due to product and price competition, changes in customer preferences or healthcare purchasing patterns, resistance by healthcare providers or uncertainty over third-party reimbursement. Even following initial regulatory approval, the success of a product can be adversely impacted by safety and efficacy findings in larger real world patient populations, as well as market entry of competitive products. The Company faces increasing regulatory scrutiny which imposes significant compliance costs and exposes the Company to government investigations, legal actions and penalties. Like other companies in the healthcare industry, the Company is subject to extensive regulation, investigations and legal action, by national, state and local government agencies in the U.S. and other countries in which they operate. Regulatory issues regarding compliance with Good Manufacturing Practices (cGMP) (and comparable quality regulations in foreign countries) by manufacturers of drugs, devices and consumer products can lead to fines and penalties, product recalls, product shortages, interruptions in production, delays in new product approvals and litigation. In addition, the marketing, pricing and sale of the Companys products are subject to regulation, investigations and legal actions including under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, the Medicaid Rebate Program, federal and state false claims acts, state unfair trade practices acts and consumer protection laws. Increased scrutiny of health care industry business practices in recent years by government agencies and state attorneys general in the U.S., and any resulting investigations and prosecutions, carry risk of significant civil and criminal penalties including, but not limited to, debarment from participation in government healthcare programs. Any such debarment could have a material adverse effect on the Companys business and results of operations. The most significant current investigations and litigation brought by government agencies are described in Note 21, Legal Proceedings-Government Proceedings under Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Report. The Company faces a variety of risks associated with conducting business internationally. The Companys extensive operations and business activity outside the U.S. are accompanied by certain financial, economic and political risks, including those listed below.  ##TABLE_START  ##TABLE_END Foreign Currency Exchange : In fiscal 2018, approximately 49% of the Companys sales occurred outside of the U.S., with approximately 23% in Europe, 8% in the Western Hemisphere, excluding the U.S., and 18% in the Asia-Pacific and Africa region. Changes in non-U.S. currencies relative to the U.S. dollar impact the Companys revenues and expenses. While the Company uses financial instruments to mitigate the impact of fluctuations in currency exchange rates on its cash flows, unhedged exposures continue to be subject to currency fluctuations. In addition, the weakening or strengthening of the U.S. dollar may result in significant favorable or unfavorable translation effects when the operating results of the Companys non-U.S. business activity are translated into U.S. dollars. Inflation and Currency Devaluation Risks : The Company faces challenges in maintaining profitability of operations in economies experiencing high inflation rates. The Company has accounted for operations in Argentina (beginning in the fiscal third quarter of 2018) and Venezuela as highly inflationary, as the prior three-year cumulative inflation rate surpassed 100%. While the Company strives to maintain profit margins in these areas through cost reduction programs, productivity improvements and periodic price increases, it might experience operating losses as a result of continued inflation. In addition, the impact of currency devaluations in countries experiencing high inflation rates or significant currency exchange fluctuations could negatively impact the Companys operating results. Illegal Importation of Pharmaceutical Products : The illegal importation of pharmaceutical products from countries where government price controls or other market dynamics result in lower prices may adversely affect the Companys sales and profitability in the U.S. and other countries in which the Company operates. With the exception of limited quantities of prescription drugs for personal use, foreign imports of pharmaceutical products are illegal under current U.S. law. However, the volume of illegal imports continues to rise as the ability of patients and other customers to obtain the lower-priced imports has grown significantly. Anti-Bribery and Other Regulations: The Company is subject to various federal and foreign laws that govern its international business practices with respect to payments to government officials. Those laws include the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA), which prohibits U.S. publicly traded companies from promising, offering, or giving anything of value to foreign officials with the corrupt intent of influencing the foreign official for the purpose of helping the Company obtain or retain business or gain any improper advantage. The Companys business is heavily regulated and therefore involves significant interaction with foreign officials. Also, in many countries outside the U.S., the health care providers who prescribe human pharmaceuticals are employed by the government and the purchasers of human pharmaceuticals are government entities; therefore, the Companys interactions with these prescribers and purchasers are subject to regulation under the FCPA. In addition to the U.S. application and enforcement of the FCPA, various jurisdictions in which the Company operates have laws and regulations, including the U.K Bribery Act 2010, aimed at preventing and penalizing corrupt and anticompetitive behavior. Enforcement activities under these laws could subject the Company to additional administrative and legal proceedings and actions, which could include claims for civil penalties, criminal sanctions, and administrative remedies, including exclusion from health care programs. Other Legal, Social and Political Risks . Other risks inherent in conducting business globally include: ##TABLE_START  protective economic policies taken by governments such as trade protection measures and import/export licensing requirements; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  compliance with local regulations and laws including, in some countries, regulatory requirements restricting the Companys ability to manufacture or sell its products in the relevant market; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  diminished protection of intellectual property and contractual rights in certain jurisdictions; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  potential nationalization or expropriation of the Companys foreign assets; and ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  disruptions to markets due to war, armed conflict, terrorism, social upheavals or pandemics. ##TABLE_END Interruptions and delays in manufacturing operations could adversely affect the Companys business, sales and reputation. The Companys manufacture of products requires the timely delivery of sufficient amounts of complex, high-quality components and materials. The Company's subsidiaries operate 111 manufacturing facilities as well as sourcing from hundreds of suppliers around the world. The Company has in the past, and may in the future, face unanticipated interruptions and delays in manufacturing through its internal or external supply chain. Manufacturing disruptions can occur for many reasons including regulatory action, production quality deviations or safety issues, labor disputes, site-specific incidents (such as fires), natural disasters such as hurricanes and other severe weather events, raw material shortages, political unrest and terrorist attacks. Such delays and difficulties in manufacturing can result in product shortages, declines in sales and reputational impact as well as significant remediation and related costs associated with addressing the shortage.  ##TABLE_START  ##TABLE_END The Company relies on third parties to manufacture certain of our products. Any failure by or loss of a third party manufacturer could result in delays and increased costs, which may adversely affect our business. The Company relies on third parties to manufacture certain of our products. We depend on these third party manufacturers to allocate to us a portion of their manufacturing capacity sufficient to meet our needs, to produce products of acceptable quality and at acceptable manufacturing yields and to deliver those products to us on a timely basis and at acceptable prices. However, we cannot guarantee that these third party manufacturers will be able to meet our near-term or long-term manufacturing requirements, which could result in lost sales and have an adverse effect on our business. Other risks associated with our reliance on third parties to manufacture these products include, reliance on the third party for regulatory compliance and quality assurance, misappropriation of the Companys intellectual property, limited ability to manage our inventory, possible breach of the manufacturing agreement by the third party and the possible termination or nonrenewal of the manufacturing agreement by the third party at a time that is costly or inconvenient for us. Moreover, if any of our third party manufacturers suffer any damage to facilities, lose benefits under material agreements, experience power outages, encounter financial difficulties, are unable to secure necessary raw materials from their suppliers or suffer any other reduction in efficiency, the Company may experience significant business disruption. In the event of any such disruption, the Company would need to seek and source other qualified third party manufacturers, likely resulting in further delays and increased costs which could affect our business adversely. An information security incident, including a cybersecurity breach, could have a negative impact to the Companys business or reputation To meet business objectives, the Company relies on both internal information technology (IT) systems and networks, and those of third parties and their vendors, to process and store sensitive data, including confidential research, business plans, financial information, intellectual property, and personal data that may be subject to legal protection. The extensive information security and cybersecurity threats, which affect companies globally, pose a risk to the security and availability of these IT systems and networks, and the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the Companys sensitive data. The Company continually assesses these threats and makes investments to increase internal protection, detection, and response capabilities, as well as ensure the Companys third party providers have required capabilities and controls, to address this risk . To date, the Company has not experienced any material impact to the business or operations resulting from information or cybersecurity attacks; however, because of the frequently changing attack techniques, along with the increased volume and sophistication of the attacks, there is the potential for the Company to be adversely impacted. This impact could result in reputational, competitive, operational or other business harm as well as financial costs and regulatory action. The Company maintains cybersecurity insurance in the event of an information security or cyber incident, however, the coverage may not be sufficient to cover all financial losses.  ##TABLE_START  ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START ", "1B": " Item 1B.

Office and warehouse facilities are often leased. The Company also engages contract manufacturers. The Company is committed to maintaining all of its properties in good operating condition. McNEIL-PPC, Inc. (now Johnson  Johnson Consumer Inc.) (McNEIL-PPC) continues to operate under a consent decree, signed in 2011 with the FDA, which governs certain McNeil Consumer Healthcare manufacturing operations, and requires McNEIL-PPC to remediate the facilities it operates in Lancaster, Pennsylvania, Fort Washington, Pennsylvania, and Las Piedras, Puerto Rico (the \"Consent Decree\"). Following FDA inspections in 2015, McNEIL-PPC received notifications from the FDA that all three manufacturing facilities are in conformity with applicable laws and regulations, and commercial production has restarted. Under the Consent Decree, after receiving notice from the FDA of being in compliance with applicable laws and regulations, each of the three facilities is subject to a five-year audit period by a third-party cGMP expert. Thus, a third-party expert will continue to reassess the sites at various times until at least 2020.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION ##TABLE_ENDOrganization and Business Segments Description of the Company and Business Segments Johnson  Johnson and its subsidiaries (the Company) have approximately 135,100 employees worldwide engaged in the research and development, manufacture and sale of a broad range of products in the health care field. The Company conducts business in virtually all countries of the world with the primary focus on products related to human health and well-being. The Company is organized into three business segments: Consumer, Pharmaceutical and Medical Devices. The Consumer segment includes a broad range of products used in the baby care, oral care, beauty, over-the-counter pharmaceutical, womens health and wound care markets. These products are marketed to the general public and sold both to retail outlets and distributors throughout the world. The Pharmaceutical segment is focused on six therapeutic areas, including immunology, infectious diseases, neuroscience, oncology, pulmonary hypertension, and cardiovascular and metabolic diseases. Products in this segment are distributed directly to retailers, wholesalers, hospitals and health care professionals for prescription use. The Medical Devices segment includes a broad range of products used in the orthopaedic, surgery, interventional solutions (cardiovascular and neurovascular), diabetes care (divested in the fiscal fourth quarter of 2018) and vision fields which are distributed to wholesalers, hospitals and retailers, and used principally in the professional fields by physicians, nurses, hospitals, eye care professionals and clinics. The Executive Committee of Johnson  Johnson is the principal management group responsible for the strategic operations and allocation of the resources of the Company. This Committee oversees and coordinates the activities of the Consumer, Pharmaceutical and Medical Devices business segments. In all of its product lines, the Company competes with companies both locally and globally, throughout the world. Competition exists in all product lines without regard to the number and size of the competing companies involved. Competition in research, involving the development and the improvement of new and existing products and processes, is particularly significant. The development of new and innovative products, as well as protecting the underlying intellectual property of the Company's product portfolio, is important to the Companys success in all areas of its business. The competitive environment requires substantial investments in continuing research. In addition, the development and maintenance of customer demand for the Companys consumer products involves significant expenditures for advertising and promotion. Managements Objectives With Our Credo as the foundation, the Companys purpose is to blend heart, science and ingenuity to profoundly change the trajectory of health for humanity. The Company is committed to bringing its full breadth and depth to ensure health for people today and for future generations. United around this common ambition, the Company is poised to fulfill its purpose and successfully meet the demands of the rapidly evolving markets in which it competes. The Company is broadly based in human healthcare, and is committed to creating value by developing accessible, high quality, innovative products and services. New products introduced within the past five years accounted for approximately 25% of 2018 sales. In 2018, $10.8 billion was invested in research and development and $0.9 billion spent on acquisitions, reflecting managements commitment to create life-enhancing innovations and to create value through partnerships that will profoundly change the trajectory of health for humanity. A critical driver of the Companys success, is the 135,100 diverse employees that work across more than 260 operating companies, which are located in more than 60 countries. Employees are empowered and inspired to lead with the Companys Our Credo and purpose as guides. This allows every employee to use the Companys reach and size to advance the Company's purpose, and to also lead with agility and urgency. Leveraging the extensive resources across the enterprise, enables the Company to innovate and execute with excellence. This ensures the Company can remain focused on addressing the unmet needs of society every day and invest for an enduring impact, ultimately delivering value to its patients, consumers and healthcare professionals, employees, communities and shareholders.    ##TABLE_START  ##TABLE_END Results of Operations Analysis of Consolidated Sales In 2018, worldwide sales increased 6.7% to $81.6 billion, compared to an increases of 6.3% and 2.6% in 2017 and 2016, respectively.

Growth was primarily driven by NEUTROGENA  , OGX  and AVEENO  products as well as strength of DR. CI: LABO and DABAO  products outside the U.S. Growth was partially offset by the divestiture of NIZORAL  . The Over-the-Counter (OTC) franchise sales of $4.3 billion increased 5.0% as compared to the prior year. Growth was primarily driven by share, consumption and market growth across multiple brands including ZYRTEC  , TYLENOL  and Children's MOTRIN  , as well as digestive health products and anti-smoking aids. Additionally, sales from the recent U.S. acquisition of Zarbee's Inc. contributed approximately 0.9% to growth. The Baby Care franchise sales were $1.9 billion in 2018, a decrease of 3.0% compared to the prior year, primarily due to JOHNSON's  share decline and increased trade promotions due to the JOHNSON's  baby relaunch and the negative impact of currency. This was partially offset by strong growth of AVEENO  baby driven by geographic expansion. The Oral Care franchise sales of $1.6 billion increased 1.6% as compared to the prior year, primarily driven by strong marketing campaigns and new product launches. The Womens Health franchise sales were $1.0 billion in 2018, a decrease of 0.1% as compared to the prior year. Growth in Latin America was offset by the negative impact of currency. The Wound Care/Other franchise sales were $0.7 billion in 2018, a decrease of 13.4% as compared to the prior year, primarily due to the divestiture of COMPEED  . Consumer segment sales in 2017 were $13.6 billion, an increase of 2.2% from 2016, which included 1.3% operational growth and a positive currency impact of 0.9%. U.S. Consumer segment sales were $5.6 billion, an increase of 2.7%. International sales were $8.0 billion, an increase of 1.9%, which included 0.4% operational growth and a positive currency impact of 1.5%.

Growth was driven by strong uptake of STELARA  (ustekinumab) in Crohn's disease, strong launch uptake of TREMFYA  (guselkumab), expanded indications of SIMPONI  /SIMPONI ARIA  (golimumab), and the U.S. immunology market growth. Immunology was negatively impacted by lower sales of REMICADE  (infliximab) due to increased discounts/rebates and biosimilar competition. The patents for REMICADE  (infliximab) in certain countries in Europe expired in February 2015. Biosimilar versions of REMICADE  have been introduced in certain markets outside the U.S., resulting in a reduction in sales of REMICADE  in those markets. Additional biosimilar competition will likely result in a further reduction in REMICADE  sales in markets outside the United States. In the U.S., a biosimilar version of REMICADE  was introduced in 2016, and additional competitors continue to enter the market. Continued infliximab biosimilar competition in the U.S. market will result in a further reduction in U.S. sales of REMICADE  . See Note 21 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a description of legal matters regarding the REMICADE  patents. Infectious disease products sales were $3.3 billion in 2018, representing an increase of 4.8% as compared to the prior year.  Sales growth of PREZCOBIX  /REZOLSTA  (darunavir/cobicistat), EDURANT  /rilpivirine, and the launch of SYMTUZA  and JULUCA  (dolutegravir/rilpivirine) was partially offset by lower sales of PREZISTA  (darunavir). Neuroscience products sales were $6.1 billion, representing an increase of 1.5% as compared to the prior year. Strong sales of long-acting injectables INVEGA TRINZA  /TREVICTA  (paliperidone palmitate) and INVEGA SUSTENNA  /XEPLION  were partially offset by cannibalization of RISPERDAL CONSTA  (risperidone) and generic competition for CONCERTA  /methylphenidate. Oncology products achieved sales of $9.8 billion in 2018, representing an increase of 35.6% as compared to the prior year.  Contributors to the growth were strong sales of DARZALEX  (daratumumab) with continued market growth and share gain, IMBRUVICA  (ibrutinib) due to increased patient uptake globally and sales of ZYTIGA  (abiraterone acetate) driven by LATITUDE data and market growth. Additionally, sales from the launch of ERLEADA (apalutamide) contributed to the growth. A number of companies marketing generic pharmaceuticals have filed Abbreviated New Drug Applications (ANDAs) with the FDA, or undertaken similar regulatory processes outside of the U.S., seeking to market generic forms of ZYTIGA  prior to expiration of its applicable patents. These ANDAs include allegations of non-infringement and invalidity of the applicable patents. In October 2018, the Court issued a ruling invalidating all asserted claims of the applicable patent. Janssen has appealed the Courts decision. In November 2018, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit denied Janssens request for an injunction pending appeal. As a result, several generic versions of ZYTIGA  have entered the market, resulting in a decline in sales of ZYTIGA  in the United States. In 2018, the Company reported U.S. sales of $1.8 billion for ZYTIGA  . See Note 21 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a description of legal matters regarding ZYTIGA  . The Pulmonary Hypertension therapeutic area was established with the acquisition of Actelion Ltd on June 16, 2017. Sales in 2018 represented a full year as compared to half a year in 2017. Sales of OPSUMIT  (macitentan) and UPTRAVI  (selexipag) were positively impacted by market growth and share gains while sales of TRACLEER  (bosetan) were negatively impacted by increased use of OPSUMIT  and generics. Cardiovascular/Metabolism/Other products sales were $5.8 billion, a decline of 7.5% as compared to the prior year. Lower sales of INVOKANA  /INVOKAMET  (canagliflozin) in the U.S. was primarily due to an increase in price discounts, higher rebates and market share decline driven by competitive pressure. Lower sales of XARELTO  (rivaroxaban) were driven by an increase in discounts and rebates, partially offset by an increase in market share.  ##TABLE_START  ##TABLE_END During 2018, the Company advanced its pipeline with several regulatory submissions and approvals for new drugs and additional indications for existing drugs as follows: ##TABLE_START Product Name (Chemical Name) Indication US Approval EU Approval US Filing EU Filing DARZALEX  (daratumumab) Frontline multiple myeloma transplant ineligible patients in combination with bortezomib, melphalan, and prednisone     erdafitinib Treatment of locally advanced or metastatic urothelial cancer     ERLEADA (apalutamide) Treatment of non-metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer     esketamine Antidepressant for treatment-resistant depression in adults     IMBRUVICA  (ibrutinib) Treatment of Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia used in combination with rituximab      Treatment for previously untreated Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia in combination with obinutuzumab     INVOKANA  (canagliflozin) Reduce the risk of death in type 2 diabetes with established, or risk for, cardiovascular disease.

Growth in Advanced Surgery was primarily driven by endocutter, biosurgery and energy products. Growth in General Surgery was primarily driven by wound care products. Growth in Specialty Surgery was primarily driven by Advanced Sterilization Products. The Orthopaedics franchise sales were $8.9 billion in 2018, a decrease of 1.9% from 2017. The decline in Spine  Other was primarily due to the Codman Neurosurgery divestiture and share loss in Spine partially offset by new product launches. The decline in knees was primarily due to competitive pressure in the U.S. partially offset by growth in Asia Pacific. Growth in hips and trauma was due to continued uptake of new products. The Vision franchise achieved sales of $4.6 billion in 2018, an increase of 12.1% from 2017. Growth was primarily driven by strength of the astigmatism and daily disposable lenses in the OASYS  contact lenses category. Surgical growth was driven by cataract performance primarily outside the U.S. The Interventional Solutions franchise (includes the Cerenovus business previously included in Spine and Other in Orthopaedics) sales were $2.6 billion, an increase of 15.2% from 2017. Strong growth in the electrophysiology business was driven by Atrial Fibrillation procedure growth and continued uptake of the THERMOCOOL SMARTTOUCH  Contact Force Sensing Catheter. The Diabetes Care franchise sales were $1.0 billion, a decrease of 37.5% from 2017. The decline was primarily due to divestiture of its LifeScan business in the fiscal fourth quarter of 2018 and the Company's decision to exit the Animas insulin pump business in the fiscal fourth quarter of 2017. The Medical Devices segment sales in 2017 were $26.6 billion, an increase of 5.9% from 2016, which included an operational increase of 5.7% and a positive currency impact of 0.2%. U.S. sales were $12.8 billion, an increase of 4.5% as compared to the prior year. International sales were $13.8 billion, an increase of 7.1% as compared to the prior year, with an  ##TABLE_START  ##TABLE_END operational increase of 6.7% and a positive currency impact of 0.4%. In 2017, acquisitions and divestitures had a net positive impact of 4.2% on the worldwide operational sales growth of the Medical Devices segment as compared to 2016. Analysis of Consolidated Earnings Before Provision for Taxes on Income Consolidated earnings before provision for taxes on income was $18.0 billion, $17.7 billion and $19.8 billion for the fiscal years ended 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. As a percent to sales, consolidated earnings before provision for taxes on income was 22.1%, 23.1%, and 27.5% in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Cost of Products Sold and Selling, Marketing and Administrative Expenses: Cost of products sold and selling, marketing and administrative expenses as a percent to sales were as follows:* ##TABLE_START % of Sales    Cost of products sold*  33.2 %  33.3  30.3 Percent point increase/(decrease) over the prior year  (0.1 )  3.0  (0.3 ) Selling, marketing and administrative expenses*  27.6 %  28.1  27.9 Percent point increase/(decrease) over the prior year  (0.5 )  0.2  (2.2 ) ##TABLE_END*Prior years amounts were reclassified to conform to current year presentation (adoption of ASU 2017-07) In 2018, cost of products sold as a percent to sales decreased to 33.2% from 33.3% as compared to the same period a year ago primarily due to lower inventory step-up costs related to the Actelion acquisition and favorable product and segment mix driven by a higher percentage of sales from the Pharmaceutical segment. This was mostly offset by higher amortization expense primarily related to the Actelion acquisition on June 16, 2017. Intangible asset amortization expense of $4.4 billion was included in cost of products sold for 2018 as compared to $3.0 billion in 2017. There was a decrease in the percent to sales of selling, marketing and administrative expenses in 2018 as compared to the prior year, primarily due to lower costs relative to sales growth in the Pharmaceutical business and favorable segment mix. In 2017, cost of products sold as a percent to sales increased to 33.3% from 30.3% as compared to the same period a year ago. The unfavorable increase was primarily driven by $2.3 billion of higher amortization expense and charges for inventory step-up related to the recent acquisitions, primarily Actelion. Intangible asset amortization expense of $3.0 billion was included in cost of products sold for 2017 as compared to $1.2 billion in 2016. There was an increase in the percent to sales of selling, marketing and administrative expenses in 2017 as compared to the prior year, primarily due to investments in new product launches partially offset by favorable mix.  ##TABLE_START  ##TABLE_END Research and Development Expense: Research and development expense by segment of business was as follows:* ##TABLE_START     (Dollars in Millions)  Amount  % of Sales**  Amount  % of Sales**  Amount  % of Sales** Consumer  $  4.1 %   4.3   4.4 Pharmaceutical  8,446  20.7  8,392  23.1  7,001  20.9 Medical Devices  1,764  6.5  1,616  6.1  1,557  6.2 Total research and development expense  $ 10,775  13.2 %  10,594  13.9  9,143  12.7 Percent increase/(decrease) over the prior year  1.7 %    15.9    1.6   ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START *Prior years amounts were reclassified to conform to current year presentation (adoption of ASU 2017-07) **As a percent to segment sales ##TABLE_ENDResearch and development activities represent a significant part of the Company's business. These expenditures relate to the processes of discovering, testing and developing new products, upfront payments and milestones, improving existing products, as well as ensuring product efficacy and regulatory compliance prior to launch. The Company remains committed to investing in research and development with the aim of delivering high quality and innovative products. In 2018, worldwide costs of research and development activities increased by 1.7% compared to 2017 but decreased as a percent of sales. The decrease as a percent of sales in the Pharmaceutical segment was attributable to lower costs relative to sales growth. The increased dollar spend in the Medical Devices and Pharmaceutical segments was for investment spending to advance the pipeline. In 2017, worldwide costs of research and development activities increased by 15.9% compared to 2016. The increase as a percent of sales was primarily in the Pharmaceutical segment due to general portfolio progression as well as collaborative agreements entered into with Idorsia Ltd. and Legend Biotech. Research facilities are located in the U.S., Belgium, Brazil, China, France, Germany, India, Israel, the Netherlands, Poland, Singapore, Sweden, Switzerland and the United Kingdom with additional RD support in over 30 other countries. In-Process Research and Development (IPRD): In 2018, the Company recorded an IPRD charge of $1.1 billion. Of the $1.1 billion, a partial impairment charge of $0.8 billion related to the development program of AL-8176, an investigational drug for the treatment of Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) and human metapneumovirus (hMPV) acquired with the 2014 acquisition of Alios Biopharma Inc. The impairment charge was calculated based on updated cash flow projections discounted for the inherent risk in the asset development and reflects the impact of the phase 2b clinical trial suspension, a decrease in the probability of success factors and the ongoing analysis of asset development activities. The Company continues to evaluate information with respect to the development program and will monitor the remaining $0.9 billion intangible asset for further impairment. In addition, an impairment charge of $0.3 billion was recorded for the discontinuation of the development project for an anti-thrombin antibody associated with the 2015 acquisition of XO1 Limited. In 2017, the Company recorded an IPRD charge of $0.4 billion primarily for the discontinuation of certain development projects related to Novira which was acquired in 2015. The product development was canceled due to safety concerns. In 2016, the Company recorded an IPRD charge of $29 million for the discontinuation of a development program related to Crucell. Other (Income) Expense, Net: Other (income) expense, net is the account where the Company records gains and losses related to the sale and write-down of certain investments in equity securities held by Johnson  Johnson Innovation - JJDC, Inc. (JJDC), unrealized gains and losses on investments, gains and losses on divestitures, certain transactional currency gains and losses, acquisition-related costs, litigation accruals and settlements, as well as royalty income. The change in other (income) expense, net for the fiscal year 2018 was an unfavorable change of $1.4 billion primarily due to litigation expense of $2.0 billion in 2018 as compared to $1.3 billion in 2017. Additionally, 2018 included unrealized losses on securities of $0.2 billion and lower realized gains of $0.4 billion related to investments in equity securities as compared to the prior year. This was partially offset by a reversal of a contingent liability of $0.2 billion and lower costs of $0.1 billion related to the Actelion and AMO acquisitions in 2018 as compared to 2017. The fiscal year of 2017 included a gain of $0.2 billion related to monetization of future royalty receivables offset by an asset impairment charge of $0.2 billion primarily related to the insulin pump business. Divestiture gains were approximately $1.2 billion in 2018 and included the LifeScan business, NIZORAL  , RoC  and certain non-strategic Pharmaceutical products. Divestiture gains were approximately $1.3 billion in 2017 and primarily included the Codman Neurosurgery and COMPEED  divestitures. Additionally, restructuring related expense in 2018 was $0.3 billion as compared to $0.4 billion 2017. The change in other (income) expense, net for the fiscal year 2017 was a favorable change of $0.3 billion due to higher gains of $0.7 billion on the sale of assets/businesses, primarily the Codman Neurosurgery and COMPEED  divestitures, a gain of $0.2 billion related to monetization of future royalty receivables and a higher gain of $0.3 billion related to the sale of certain investments in equity securities as compared to the prior year. This was partially offset by higher litigation expense of $0.4 billion, $0.3 billion of acquisition costs related to Actelion and AMO, an asset impairment charge of $0.2 billion primarily  ##TABLE_START  ##TABLE_END related to the insulin pump business and a higher restructuring related charge of $0.2 billion as compared to the fiscal year 2016. Interest (Income) Expense: Interest income was higher in 2018 as compared to 2017 due to a higher average interest rate and a benefit from net investment hedging partially offset by a lower average cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities balance during the period. Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaled $19.7 billion at the end of 2018, and averaged $19.0 billion as compared to the cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities total of $18.3 billion and $30.1 billion average cash balance in 2017. The decrease in the average balance of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities was due to the use of cash for general corporate purposes, primarily the Actelion acquisition for $29.6 billion, net of cash acquired late in the fiscal second quarter of 2017. Interest expense in 2018 was higher as compared to 2017 due to a higher average debt balance. The average debt balance was $32.5 billion in 2018 versus $30.9 billion in 2017. The total debt balance at the end of 2018 was $30.5 billion as compared to $34.6 billion at the end of 2017. Interest income in 2017 increased slightly as compared to 2016 due to higher average interest rates partially offset by lower cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities balances during the period. Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaled $18.3 billion at the end of 2017, and averaged $30.1 billion as compared to the $40.1 billion average cash balance in 2016. The decrease in the balance of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities was due to the use of cash for general corporate purposes including acquisitions, primarily the Actelion acquisition for $29.6 billion, net of cash acquired. Interest expense in 2017 was higher as compared to 2016. The average debt balance was $30.9 billion in 2017 versus $23.5 billion in 2016. The total debt balance at the end of 2017 was $34.6 billion as compared to $27.1 billion at the end of 2016. The higher debt balance of approximately $7.5 billion was primarily due to increased borrowings. The Company increased borrowings in February and November of 2017, capitalizing on favorable terms in the capital markets. The proceeds of the borrowings were used for general corporate purposes, including the completion of the stock repurchase program.

The decrease in the income before tax as a percent of sales in 2018 as compared to 2017 was primarily attributable to higher litigation expense of $0.3 billion in 2018 partially offset by slower increases in expenses relative to the increase in sales. Divestiture gains for the fiscal year of 2018, which included the divestitures of NIZORAL  and RoC  were comparable to fiscal year of 2017. A gain of $0.3 billion was recognized from the divestiture of NIZORAL  . In 2017, the Consumer segment income before tax as a percent to sales was 18.6%, versus 18.3% in 2016. The increase in the income before tax as a percent of sales in 2017 as compared to 2016 was attributable to higher gains on divestitures, primarily the divestiture of COMPEED  in 2017. This was partially offset by higher selling, marketing and administrative expenses as compared to the prior year due to increased advertising and promotional spending and slightly higher amortization expense in 2017 related to acquisitions. Additionally, the fiscal year 2016 was negatively impacted by operations in Venezuela. Pharmaceutical Segment: In 2018, the Pharmaceutical segment income before tax as a percent to sales was 30.9% versus 30.6% in 2017. The increase in the income before tax as a percent of sales was primarily due to lower inventory step-up costs related to Actelion of $0.6 billion, favorable product mix and slower increases in expenses relative to the increase in sales, a contingent liability reversal of $0.2 billion and higher divestiture gains of $0.2 billion from divestitures of certain non-strategic Pharmaceutical products. This was partially offset by higher amortization expense of $1.3 billion primarily related to the Actelion acquisition, a higher IPRD charge of $0.7 billion and an unrealized loss on securities of $0.2 billion as compared to  ##TABLE_START  ##TABLE_END the prior year. Additionally, 2017 included a gain of $0.2 billion related to monetization of future royalty receivables and a higher gain of $0.3 billion related to the sale of certain investments in equity securities. In 2017, the Pharmaceutical segment income before tax as a percent to sales was 30.6% versus 38.3% in 2016. The decrease in the income before tax as a percent of sales was primarily due to $2.3 billion of higher amortization expense and other costs related to the Actelion acquisition, higher research and development expense, a higher IPRD charge of $0.4 billion related to Novira and lower gains on divestitures as compared to the prior year. Additionally, the fiscal year 2016 included a positive adjustment of $0.5 billion to previous reserve estimates. This was partially offset by a gain of $0.2 billion related to monetization of future royalty receivables, a higher gain of $0.2 billion related to the sale of certain investments in equity securities and favorable product mix in 2017. Medical Devices Segment: In 2018, the Medical Devices segment income before tax as a percent to sales was 16.3% versus 20.3% in 2017. The decrease in the income before tax as a percent to sales was primarily due higher litigation expense of $1.7 billion in 2018 as compared to $1.1 billion in 2017 and higher investments in the business in 2018. Additionally, 2018 had lower divestiture gains of approximately $0.3 billion as compared to divestiture gains in 2017. In 2018 the Company recorded a gain of $0.5 billion related to the LifeScan divestiture. This was partially offset by lower restructuring expense of $0.2 billion in 2018 as compared to 2017. Additionally, 2017 included an asset impairment charge of $0.2 billion primarily related to the insulin pump business. In 2017, the Medical Devices segment income before tax as a percent to sales was 20.3% versus 22.2% in 2016. The decrease in the income before tax as a percent to sales was primarily due to $0.3 billion of higher amortization expense and other acquisition costs related to AMO, $0.3 billion of higher litigation, an asset impairment charge of $0.2 billion primarily related to the insulin pump business, $0.1 billion of higher restructuring and investments in new product launches as compared to the fiscal year 2016. This was partially offset by $0.8 billion higher gains in 2017 related to divestitures, primarily the divestiture of Codman Neurosurgery. Restructuring: In the first quarter of 2016, the Company announced restructuring actions in its Medical Devices segment. The Company has achieved approximately $0.7 billion of annualized pre-tax cost saving in 2018 and is on track to achieve the annualized pre-tax cost savings of $0.8 billion to $1.0 billion as outlined in the restructuring actions. The savings will provide the Company with added flexibility and resources to fund investment in new growth opportunities and innovative solutions for customers and patients. In 2018, the Company recorded a pre-tax charge of $462 million, of which $46 million is included in cost of products sold and $227 million is included in other (income) expense. Total project costs of approximately $2.5 billion have been recorded since the restructuring was announced. This restructuring program was completed in the fiscal fourth quarter of 2018. In the second quarter of 2018, the Company announced plans to implement actions across its global supply chain that are intended to enable the Company to focus resources and increase investments in critical capabilities, technologies and solutions necessary to manufacture and supply its product portfolio of the future, enhance agility and drive growth. The Company expects these supply chain actions will include expanding its use of strategic collaborations, and bolstering its initiatives to reduce complexity, improving cost-competitiveness, enhancing capabilities and optimizing its network. Discussions regarding specific future actions are ongoing and are subject to all relevant consultation requirements before they are finalized. In total, the Company expects these actions to generate approximately $0.6 to $0.8 billion in annual pre-tax cost savings that will be substantially delivered by 2022. The Company expects to record pre-tax restructuring charges of approximately $1.9 to $2.3 billion. The Company estimates that approximately 70% of the cumulative pre-tax costs will result in cash outlays. In 2018, the Company recorded a pre-tax charge of $238 million, of which $59 million is included in cost of products sold and $117 million is included in other (income) expense. See Note 22 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional details related to the restructuring programs. Provision for Taxes on Income: The worldwide effective income tax rate was 15.0% in 2018 , 92.6% in 2017 and 16.5% in 2016 . The 2018 effective tax rate decreased by 77.6% as compared to 2017. The 2017 effective tax rate was primarily driven by a provisional tax charge of approximately $13.0 billion as a result of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) recorded in the fourth quarter of 2017 and the impact of a Belgian statutory tax rate change which increased the 2017 effective rate by 3.4%. The Company also received a benefit in 2018 from a lower U.S. statutory tax rate vs. 2017 as well as favorable adjustments to the 2017 provisional TCJA tax charge partially offset by unfavorable income tax mix and the U.S. tax on global intangible low-taxed income (GILTI). The 2017 effective tax rate increased by 76.1% as compared to 2016, primarily driven by the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) in the United States in December 2017. The enactment of the TCJA resulted in a provisional tax charge in the fourth quarter of 2017, of approximately $13.0 billion or approximately 73.3 percentage point increase to the effective tax rate. See Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional details related to the TCJA.  ##TABLE_START  ##TABLE_END The remainder of the increase in the tax rate for 2017 was related to the remeasurement of the Companys deferred tax assets in Belgium, as a result of changes in the Belgian statutory corporate tax rate, enacted in December 2017, offset by a tax benefit for the closure of the Companys Animas insulin pump business. The government in Switzerland is currently considering tax reform legislation, which could have a material impact on the Companys effective tax rate if enacted into law. See Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional details related to the TCJA and income taxes. Liquidity and Capital Resources Liquidity  Cash Flows Cash and cash equivalents were $18.1 billion at the end of 2018 as compared to $17.8 billion at the end of 2017. The primary sources and uses of cash that contributed to the $0.3 billion increase were approximately $22.2 billion of cash generated from operating activities. This was partially offset by $3.2 billion net cash used by investing activities, $18.5 billion net cash used by financing activities and $0.2 billion due to the effect on exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents. In addition, the Company had $1.6 billion in marketable securities at the end of 2018 and $0.5 billion at the end of 2017. See Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional details on cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities. Cash flow from operations of $22.2 billion was the result of $15.3 billion of net earnings and $9.2 billion of non-cash expenses and other adjustments for depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation and assets write-downs, offset by $2.3 billion from net gains on sale of assets/businesses, deferred tax provision and accounts receivable allowances, $3.9 billion related to an increase in accounts receivable, inventories and other current and non-current assets and a decrease in other current and non-current liabilities. Additional sources of operating cash flow of $4.0 billion resulted from an increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities. The decrease in current and non-current liabilities is primarily due to the 2018 tax payment related to TCJA. Investing activities use of $3.2 billion was for additions to property, plant and equipment of $3.7 billion, the net purchase of investments primarily marketable securities of $1.3 billion, acquisitions, net of cash acquired of $0.9 billion (primarily the acquisitions of Zarbee's) and other uses of $0.5 billion. This was partially offset by $3.2 billion of proceeds from the disposal of assets/businesses (primarily the divestiture of LifeScan). Financing activities use of $18.5 billion was primarily for dividends to shareholders of $9.5 billion, $5.9 billion for the repurchase of common stock, $3.9 billion for the net retirement of short and long-term debt and $0.2 billion of other financing. Financing activities also included sources of $1.0 billion of proceeds from stock options exercised/employee withholding tax on stock awards, net. On December 17, 2018, the Company announced that its Board of Directors approved a share repurchase program, authorizing the Company to purchase up to $5.0 billion of the Company's shares of common stock. The repurchase program has no time limit and may be suspended for periods or discontinued at any time. Any shares acquired will be available for general corporate purposes. The Company intends to finance the share repurchase program through available cash. As of December 30, 2018, $0.9 billion has been repurchased under the program. As of December 30, 2018, the Company's notes payable and long-term debt was in excess of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities. As of December 30, 2018, the net debt position was $10.8 billion as compared to the prior year of $16.3 billion. There was a decrease in the net debt position due to retirement of debt. The debt balance at the end of 2018 was $30.5 billion as compared to $34.6 billion in 2017. Additionally there was a higher cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities balance at the end of 2018. In 2018, the Company continued to have access to liquidity through the commercial paper market. Additionally, as a result of the TCJA, the Company has access to its cash outside the U.S. at a significantly reduced cost. The Company anticipates that operating cash flows, the ability to raise funds from external sources, borrowing capacity from existing committed credit facilities and access to the commercial paper markets will continue to provide sufficient resources to fund operating needs for the next twelve months. The Company monitors the global capital markets on an ongoing basis and from time to time may raise capital when market conditions are favorable. The Company filed a new shelf registration on February 27, 2017 which will enable it to issue debt securities on a timely basis. For additional details on borrowings, see Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Financing and Market Risk The Company uses financial instruments to manage the impact of foreign exchange rate changes on cash flows. Accordingly, the Company enters into forward foreign exchange contracts to protect the value of certain foreign currency assets and liabilities and to hedge future foreign currency transactions primarily related to product costs. Gains or losses on these contracts are offset by the gains or losses on the underlying transactions. A 10% appreciation of the U.S. Dollar from the December 30, 2018 market rates would increase the unrealized value of the Companys forward contracts by $57 million. Conversely, a 10% depreciation of the U.S. Dollar from the December 30, 2018 market rates would decrease the unrealized value of the Companys forward contracts by $69 million. In either scenario, the gain or loss on the forward contract would be offset by the gain or loss on the underlying transaction, and therefore, would have no impact on future anticipated earnings and cash flows.  ##TABLE_START  ##TABLE_END The Company hedges the exposure to fluctuations in currency exchange rates, and the effect on certain assets and liabilities in foreign currency, by entering into currency swap contracts. A 1% change in the spread between U.S. and foreign interest rates on the Companys interest rate sensitive financial instruments would either increase or decrease the unrealized value of the Companys swap contracts by approximately $226 million. In either scenario, at maturity, the gain or loss on the swap contract would be offset by the gain or loss on the underlying transaction, and therefore, would have no impact on future anticipated cash flows. The Company does not enter into financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes. Further, the Company has a policy of only entering into contracts with parties that have at least an investment grade credit rating. The counter-parties to these contracts are major financial institutions and there is no significant concentration of exposure with any one counter-party. Management believes the risk of loss is remote. During the fiscal second quarter of 2017, the Company entered into credit support agreements (CSA) with certain derivative counterparties establishing collateral thresholds based on respective credit ratings and netting agreements. The Company invests in both fixed rate and floating rate interest earning securities which carry a degree of interest rate risk. The fair market value of fixed rate securities may be adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates, while floating rate securities may produce less income than predicted if interest rates fall. A 1% (100 basis points) change in spread on the Companys interest rate sensitive investments would either increase or decrease the unrealized value of cash equivalents and current marketable securities by approximately $8 million. The Company has access to substantial sources of funds at numerous banks worldwide. In September 2018, the Company secured a new 364-day Credit Facility. Total credit available to the Company approximates $10 billion, which expires on September 12, 2019. Interest charged on borrowings under the credit line agreement is based on either bids provided by banks, the prime rate or London Interbank Offered Rates (LIBOR), plus applicable margins. Commitment fees under the agreement are not material. Total borrowings at the end of 2018 and 2017 were $30.5 billion and $34.6 billion, respectively. The decrease in borrowings was due to the retirement of debt in 2018. In 2018, net debt (cash and current marketable securities, net of debt) was $10.8 billion compared to net debt of $16.3 billion in 2017. Total debt represented 33.8% of total capital (shareholders equity and total debt) in 2018 and 36.5% of total capital in 2017. Shareholders equity per share at the end of 2018 was $22.44 compared to $22.43 at year-end 2017 . A summary of borrowings can be found in Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Contractual Obligations and Commitments The Companys contractual obligations are primarily for the recently enacted tax legislation, leases, debt and unfunded retirement plans. There are no other significant obligations. To satisfy these obligations, the Company will use cash from operations. The following table summarizes the Companys contractual obligations and their aggregate maturities as of December 30, 2018 (see Notes 7, 8, 10 and 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further details): ##TABLE_START (Dollars in Millions)  Tax Legislation (TCJA)  Debt Obligations  Interest on Debt Obligations  Unfunded Retirement Plans  Operating Leases  Total  $   2,636     3,900   1,098     2,798   1,796     3,704   2,134     3,966  1,522  1,553     4,030 After 2023  4,565  21,103  8,850    35,354 Total  $ 8,242  30,320  13,086  1,208   53,752 ##TABLE_ENDFor tax matters, see Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. For other retirement plan and post-employment medical benefit information, see Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The table does not include activity related to business combinations. Dividends The Company increased its dividend in 2018 for the 56th consecutive year. Cash dividends paid were $3.54 per share in 2018 compared with dividends of $3.32 per share in 2017 , and $3.15 per share in 2016 .  ##TABLE_START  ##TABLE_END  Other Information Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Managements discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition are based on the Companys consolidated financial statements that have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. (GAAP). The preparation of these financial statements requires that management make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported for revenues, expenses, assets, liabilities and other related disclosures. Actual results may or may not differ from these estimates. The Company believes that the understanding of certain key accounting policies and estimates are essential in achieving more insight into the Companys operating results and financial condition. These key accounting policies include revenue recognition, income taxes, legal and self-insurance contingencies, valuation of long-lived assets, assumptions used to determine the amounts recorded for pensions and other employee benefit plans and accounting for stock based awards. Revenue Recognition: The Company recognizes revenue from product sales when obligations under the terms of a contract with the customer are satisfied; generally, this occurs with the transfer of control of the goods to customers. The Company's global payment terms are typically between 30 to 90 days. Provisions for certain rebates, sales incentives, trade promotions, coupons, product returns and discounts to customers are accounted for as variable consideration and recorded as a reduction in sales. See Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for the Accounting Standards Update related to revenue which was adopted in 2018. Product discounts granted are based on the terms of arrangements with direct, indirect and other market participants, as well as market conditions, including consideration of competitor pricing. Rebates are estimated based on contractual terms, historical experience, patient outcomes, trend analysis and projected market conditions in the various markets served. The Company evaluates market conditions for products or groups of products primarily through the analysis of wholesaler and other third-party sell-through and market research data, as well as internally generated information. Sales returns are estimated and recorded based on historical sales and returns information. Products that exhibit unusual sales or return patterns due to dating, competition or other marketing matters are specifically investigated and analyzed as part of the accounting for sales return accruals. Sales returns allowances represent a reserve for products that may be returned due to expiration, destruction in the field, or in specific areas, product recall. The sales returns reserve is based on historical return trends by product and by market as a percent to gross sales. In accordance with the Companys accounting policies, the Company generally issues credit to customers for returned goods. The Companys sales returns reserves are accounted for in accordance with the U.S. GAAP guidance for revenue recognition when right of return exists. Sales returns reserves are recorded at full sales value. Sales returns in the Consumer and Pharmaceutical segments are almost exclusively not resalable. Sales returns for certain franchises in the Medical Devices segment are typically resalable but are not material. The Company infrequently exchanges products from inventory for returned products. The sales returns reserve for the total Company has been approximately 1.0% of annual net trade sales during the fiscal reporting years 2018 , 2017 and 2016 . Promotional programs, such as product listing allowances and cooperative advertising arrangements, are recorded in the same period as related sales. Continuing promotional programs include coupons and volume-based sales incentive programs. The redemption cost of consumer coupons is based on historical redemption experience by product and value. Volume-based incentive programs are based on the estimated sales volumes for the incentive period and are recorded as products are sold. These arrangements are evaluated to determine the appropriate amounts to be deferred or recorded as a reduction of revenue. The Company also earns profit-share payments through collaborative arrangements of certain products, which are included in sales to customers. For all years presented, profit-share payments were less than 2.0% of the total revenues and are included in sales to customers. In addition, the Company enters into collaboration arrangements that contain multiple revenue generating activities. Amounts due from collaborative partners for these arrangements are recognized as each activity is performed or delivered, based on the relative selling price. Upfront fees received as part of these arrangements are deferred and recognized over the performance period. See Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional disclosures on collaborations. Reasonably likely changes to assumptions used to calculate the accruals for rebates, returns and promotions are not anticipated to have a material effect on the financial statements. The Company currently discloses the impact of changes to assumptions in the quarterly or annual filing in which there is a material financial statement impact.  ##TABLE_START  ##TABLE_END Below are tables that show the progression of accrued rebates, returns, promotions, reserve for doubtful accounts and reserve for cash discounts by segment of business for the fiscal years ended December 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017 .

The Company estimates deferred tax assets and liabilities based on enacted tax regulations and rates. Future changes in tax laws and rates may affect recorded deferred tax assets and liabilities. The Company has unrecognized tax benefits for uncertain tax positions. The Company follows U.S. GAAP, which prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. Management believes that changes in these estimates would not have a material effect on the Company's results of operations, cash flows or financial position. The Company has recorded deferred tax liabilities on all undistributed earnings prior to December 31, 2017 from its international subsidiaries. The Company has not provided deferred taxes on the undistributed earnings subsequent to January 1, 2018 from certain international subsidiaries where the earnings are considered to be indefinitely reinvested. The Company intends to continue to reinvest these earnings in those international operations. If the Company decides at a later date to repatriate these earnings to the U.S., the Company would be required to provide for the net tax effects on these amounts. The Company estimates that the total tax effect of this repatriation would be approximately $0.7 billion under current enacted tax laws and regulations and at current currency exchange rates. See Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding income taxes. Legal and Self Insurance Contingencies:  The Company records accruals for various contingencies, including legal proceedings and product liability claims as these arise in the normal course of business. The accruals are based on managements judgment as to the probability of losses and, where applicable, actuarially determined estimates. The Company has self insurance through a wholly-owned captive insurance company. In addition to accruals in the self insurance program, claims that exceed the insurance coverage are accrued when losses are probable and amounts can be reasonably estimated. The Company follows the provisions of U.S. GAAP when recording litigation related contingencies. A liability is recorded when a loss is probable and can be reasonably estimated. The best estimate of a loss within a range is accrued; however, if no estimate in the range is better than any other, the minimum amount is accrued. See Notes 1 and 21 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding product liability and legal proceedings.  ##TABLE_START  ##TABLE_END Long-Lived and Intangible Assets: The Company assesses changes in economic conditions and makes assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows in evaluating the value of the Companys property, plant and equipment, goodwill and intangible assets. As these assumptions and estimates may change over time, it may or may not be necessary for the Company to record impairment charges. Employee Benefit Plans: The Company sponsors various retirement and pension plans, including defined benefit, defined contribution and termination indemnity plans, which cover most employees worldwide. These plans are based on assumptions for the discount rate, expected return on plan assets, mortality rates, expected salary increases, health care cost trend rates and attrition rates. See Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further details on these rates and the effect a rate change to the health care cost trend would have on the Companys results of operations. Stock Based Compensation: The Company recognizes compensation expense associated with the issuance of equity instruments to employees for their services. Based on the type of equity instrument, the fair value is estimated on the date of grant using either the Black-Scholes option valuation model or a combination of both the Black-Scholes option valuation model and Monte Carlo valuation model, and is expensed in the financial statements over the service period. The input assumptions used in determining fair value are the expected life, expected volatility, risk-free rate and expected dividend yield. For performance share units the fair market value is calculated for each of the three component goals at the date of grant. The fair values for the sales and earnings per share goals of each performance share unit were estimated on the date of grant using the fair market value of the shares at the time of the award, discounted for dividends, which are not paid on the performance share units during the vesting period. The fair value for the relative total shareholder return goal of each performance share unit was estimated on the date of grant using the Monte Carlo valuation model. See Note 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. New Accounting Pronouncements Refer to Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for recently adopted accounting pronouncements and recently issued accounting pronouncements not yet adopted as of December 30, 2018 . Economic and Market Factors The Company is aware that its products are used in an environment where, for more than a decade, policymakers, consumers and businesses have expressed concerns about the rising cost of health care. In response to these concerns, the Company has a long-standing policy of pricing products responsibly. For the period 2008 - 2018, in the U.S., the weighted average compound annual growth rate of the Companys net price increases for health care products (prescription and over-the-counter drugs, hospital and professional products) was below the U.S. Consumer Price Index (CPI). The Company operates in certain countries where the economic conditions continue to present significant challenges. The Company continues to monitor these situations and take appropriate actions. Inflation rates continue to have an effect on worldwide economies and, consequently, on the way companies operate. The Company has accounted for operations in Argentina (beginning in the fiscal third quarter of 2018) and Venezuela as highly inflationary, as the prior three-year cumulative inflation rate surpassed 100%. This did not have a material impact to the Company's results in the period. In the face of increasing costs, the Company strives to maintain its profit margins through cost reduction programs, productivity improvements and periodic price increases. In June 2016, the United Kingdom (U.K.) held a referendum in which voters approved an exit from the European Union (E.U.), commonly referred to as Brexit and in March 2017 the U.K. formally started the process for the U.K. to leave the E.U. Given the lack of comparable precedent, it is unclear what financial, trade, regulatory and legal implications the withdrawal of the U.K. from the E.U. will have. Brexit creates global political and economic uncertainty, which may cause, among other consequences, volatility in exchange rates and interest rates, additional cost containment by third-party payors and changes in regulations. However, the Company currently does not believe that these and other related effects will have a material impact on the Companys consolidated financial position or operating results. As of December 30, 2018, the business of the Companys U.K. subsidiaries represented less than 3% of both the Companys consolidated assets and fiscal twelve months revenues, respectively. The Company is exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates. A 1% change in the value of the U.S. Dollar as compared to all foreign currencies in which the Company had sales, income or expense in 2018 would have increased or decreased the translation of foreign sales by approximately $390 million and net income by approximately $100 million. Governments around the world consider various proposals to make changes to tax laws, which may include increasing or decreasing existing statutory tax rates. A change in statutory tax rate in any country would result in the revaluation of the Companys deferred tax assets and liabilities related to that particular jurisdiction in the period in which the new tax law is enacted. This change would result in an expense or benefit recorded to the Companys Consolidated Statement of Earnings. The Company closely monitors these proposals as they arise in the countries where it operates. Changes to the statutory tax rate may occur at any time, and any related expense or benefit recorded may be material to the fiscal quarter and year in which the law change is enacted. On September 28, 2018 the Swiss Parliament approved the Federal Act on Tax Reform and AHV Financing (Swiss Tax Reform). However, a referendum has been called and, as a result, a public vote on the Swiss Tax Reform  ##TABLE_START  ##TABLE_END will take place on May 19th, 2019. If the Swiss Tax Reform passes, then the measures are expected to come into force in either January 2020 or January 2021. Prior to approval in the referendum and its subsequent cantonal implementation, the proposed Swiss Tax Reform is not enacted and therefore the Company has not reflected any of the potential impacts in its fiscal results. The Company is currently assessing the impact of the proposed Swiss Tax Reform, and when enacted, the law may have a material impact on the Companys operating results. The Company faces various worldwide health care changes that may continue to result in pricing pressures that include health care cost containment and government legislation relating to sales, promotions and reimbursement of health care products. Changes in the behavior and spending patterns of purchasers of health care products and services, including delaying medical procedures, rationing prescription medications, reducing the frequency of physician visits and foregoing health care insurance coverage, as a result of the current global economic downturn, may continue to impact the Companys businesses. The Company also operates in an environment increasingly hostile to intellectual property rights. Firms have filed Abbreviated New Drug Applications or Biosimilar Biological Product Applications with the FDA or otherwise challenged the coverage and/or validity of the Company's patents, seeking to market generic or biosimilar forms of many of the Companys key pharmaceutical products prior to expiration of the applicable patents covering those products. In the event the Company is not successful in defending the patent claims challenged in the resulting lawsuits, generic or biosimilar versions of the products at issue will be introduced to the market, resulting in the potential for substantial market share and revenue losses for those products, and which may result in a non-cash impairment charge in any associated intangible asset. There is also a risk that one or more competitors could launch a generic or biosimilar version of the product at issue following regulatory approval even though one or more valid patents are in place. For further information, see the discussion on REMICADE  Related Cases and Litigation Against Filers of Abbreviated New Drug Applications in Note 21 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Legal Proceedings Johnson  Johnson and certain of its subsidiaries are involved in various lawsuits and claims regarding product liability, intellectual property, commercial and other matters; governmental investigations; and other legal proceedings that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of business. The Company records accruals for loss contingencies associated with these legal matters when it is probable that a liability will be incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. The Company has accrued for certain litigation matters and continues to monitor each related legal issue and adjust accruals for new information and further developments in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 450-20-25. For these and other litigation and regulatory matters currently disclosed for which a loss is probable or reasonably possible, the Company is unable to estimate the possible loss or range of loss beyond the amounts already accrued. Amounts accrued for legal contingencies often result from a complex series of judgments about future events and uncertainties that rely heavily on estimates and assumptions. The ability to make such estimates and judgments can be affected by various factors, including whether damages sought in the proceedings are unsubstantiated or indeterminate; scientific and legal discovery has not commenced or is not complete; proceedings are in early stages; matters present legal uncertainties; there are significant facts in dispute; or there are numerous parties involved. In the Company's opinion, based on its examination of these matters, its experience to date and discussions with counsel, the ultimate outcome of legal proceedings, net of liabilities accrued in the Company's balance sheet, is not expected to have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial position. However, the resolution of, or increase in accruals for, one or more of these matters in any reporting period may have a material adverse effect on the Company's results of operations and cash flows for that period. See Note 21 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding legal proceedings. Common Stock The Companys Common Stock is listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol JNJ. As of February 15, 2019, there were 142,029 record holders of Common Stock of the Company. ##TABLE_START ", "7A": " Item 7A.

Intercompany accounts and transactions are eliminated. Description of the Company and Business Segments The Company has approximately 135,100 employees worldwide engaged in the research and development, manufacture and sale of a broad range of products in the health care field. The Company conducts business in virtually all countries of the world and its primary focus is on products related to human health and well-being. The Company is organized into three business segments: Consumer, Pharmaceutical and Medical Devices. The Consumer segment includes a broad range of products used in the baby care, oral care, beauty, over-the-counter pharmaceutical, womens health and wound care markets. These products are marketed to the general public and sold both to retail outlets and distributors throughout the world. The Pharmaceutical segment is focused on six therapeutic areas, including immunology, infectious diseases, neuroscience, oncology, pulmonary hypertension, and cardiovascular and metabolic diseases. Products in this segment are distributed directly to retailers, wholesalers, hospitals and health care professionals for prescription use. The Medical Devices segment includes a broad range of products used in the orthopaedic, surgery, interventional solutions (cardiovascular and neurovascular), diabetes care (divested in the fiscal fourth quarter of 2018) and vision fields, which are distributed to wholesalers, hospitals and retailers, and used principally in the professional fields by physicians, nurses, hospitals, eye care professionals and clinics. New Accounting Standards Recently Adopted Accounting Standards ASU 2014-09 : Revenue from Contracts with Customers On January 1, 2018, the Company adopted the new accounting standard, ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers and all the related amendments (new revenue standard) to all contracts using the modified retrospective method. The cumulative effect of initially applying the new revenue standard was recognized as an adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings. The comparative information has not been restated and continues to be reported under the accounting standards in effect for those periods. The adoption of the new revenue standard has not had a material impact to either reported Sales to customers or Net earnings. Additionally, the Company will continue to recognize revenue from product sales as goods are shipped or delivered to the customer, as control of goods transfers at the same time. In accordance with the new revenue standard requirements, the disclosure of the impact of adoption on the Company's Consolidated Statement of Earnings and Balance Sheet was as follows: ##TABLE_START Statement of Earnings - For the fiscal year ended December 30, 2018 (Dollars in millions) As Reported  Effect of change  Balance without adoption of ASC 606 Sales to customers $ 81,581  (35 )  81,546       Net earnings 15,297  (28 )  15,269       Balance Sheet - As of December 30, 2018  As Reported  Effect of change  Balance without adoption of ASC 606 Assets 152,954   152,977       Liabilities 93,202   93,206       Equity $ 59,752   59,771       ##TABLE_ENDThe Company made a cumulative effect adjustment to the 2018 opening balance of retained earnings upon adoption of ASU 2014-09, which decreased beginning retained earnings by $47 million . As part of the adoption of ASC 606 see Note 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further disaggregation of revenue.  ##TABLE_START  ##TABLE_END ASU 2016-01 : Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities The Company adopted this standard as of the beginning of the fiscal year 2018 on a modified retrospective basis. The amendments in this update supersede the guidance to classify equity securities with readily determinable fair values into different categories (that is, trading or available-for-sale) and require equity securities to be measured at fair value with changes in the fair value recognized through net earnings. The standard amends financial reporting by providing relevant information about an entitys equity investments and reducing the number of items that are recognized in other comprehensive income. The Company made a cumulative effect adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings upon adoption of ASU 2016-01 that increased retained earnings by $232 million net of tax and decreased accumulated other comprehensive income for previously unrealized gains from equity investments. For additional details see Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. ASU 2016-16 : Income Taxes: Intra-Entity Transfers of Assets Other Than Inventory The Company adopted this standard as of the beginning of the fiscal year 2018. This update removes the current exception in U.S. GAAP prohibiting entities from recognizing current and deferred income tax expenses or benefits related to transfer of assets, other than inventory, within the consolidated entity. The current exception to defer the recognition of any tax impact on the transfer of inventory within the consolidated entity until it is sold to a third party remains unaffected. As discussed further in Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, in the fourth fiscal quarter of 2018 the Company elected an accounting policy to treat the tax on global intangible low-taxed income (GILTI) under the deferred tax accounting model. As a result, the Company is required to record an additional deferred tax liability related to the basis difference of these intra-entity asset transfers. The Company recorded net adjustments including an increase to deferred tax assets of approximately $2.0 billion , an increase to deferred tax liabilities of approximately $1.7 billion , related to the GILTI accounting policy election in the fourth fiscal quarter of 2018, a decrease to Other Assets of approximately $0.7 billion and a decrease to retained earnings of approximately $0.4 billion . The adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements. ASU 2017-01 : Clarifying the Definition of a Business The Company adopted this standard as of the beginning of the fiscal year 2018. This update narrows the definition of a business by providing a screen to determine when an integrated set of assets and activities is not a business. The screen specifies that an integrated set of assets and activities is not a business if substantially all of the fair value of the gross assets acquired or disposed of is concentrated in a single or a group of similar identifiable assets. This update was applied prospectively. The adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements. ASU 2017-07 : Improving the Presentation of Net Periodic Pension Cost and Net Periodic Postretirement Benefit Cost The Company adopted this standard as of the beginning of the fiscal year 2018. This update requires that an employer disaggregate the service cost component from the other components of net periodic benefit cost (NPBC). In addition, only the service cost component will be eligible for capitalization. The amendments in this update are required to be applied retrospectively for the presentation of the service cost component and the other components of NPBC in the Consolidated Statement of Earnings and prospectively, on and after the adoption date, for the capitalization of the service cost component of NPBC in assets. As required by the transition provisions of this update, the following table shows the impact of the adoption on the respective line items in the Consolidated Statement of Earnings for 2018 and the reclassifications to the 2017 and 2016 fiscal year Consolidated Statement of Earnings to retroactively apply classification of the service cost component and the other components of NPBC: ##TABLE_START (Dollars In millions)   Increase (Decrease) to Net Expense   2017  Cost of products sold  $ 85  Selling, marketing and administrative expenses  100  Research and development expense  40  Other (income) expense, net  (127 ) (225 )  (274 ) Earnings before provision for taxes on income  $     ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  ##TABLE_END The following table summarizes the cumulative effect adjustments made to the 2018 opening balance of retained earnings upon adoption of the new accounting standards mentioned above: ##TABLE_START (Dollars in Millions)  Cumulative Effect Adjustment Increase (Decrease) to Retained Earnings ASU 2014-09 - Revenue from Contracts with Customers  $ (47 ) ASU 2016-01 - Financial Instruments  ASU 2016-16 - Income Taxes: Intra-Entity Transfers  (439 ) Total  $ (254 ) ##TABLE_ENDASU 2017-12 : Targeted Improvements to Accounting for Hedging Activities The Company elected to early adopt this standard as of the beginning of the fiscal second quarter of 2018. This update makes more financial and nonfinancial hedging strategies eligible for hedge accounting. It also amends the presentation and disclosure requirements and changes how companies assess effectiveness. The adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements. For additional required disclosures see Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Recently Issued Accounting Standards Not Adopted as of December 30, 2018 ASU 2018-18 : Collaborative Arrangements This update clarifies the interaction between ASC 808, Collaborative Arrangements and ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers. The update clarifies that certain transactions between participants in a collaborative arrangement should be accounted for under ASC 606 when the counterparty is a customer. In addition, the update precludes an entity from presenting consideration from a transaction in a collaborative arrangement as revenue if the counterparty is not a customer for that transaction. This update will be effective for the Company for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, and interim periods within those fiscal years. ASU 2018-18 should be applied retrospectively to the date of initial application of ASC 606 and early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently assessing the impact of this update on the Companys consolidated financial statements and related disclosures. ASU 2018-16: Derivatives and Hedging (Topic ASC 815) This update adds the Overnight Index Swap (OIS) rate based on the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR) as an eligible benchmark interest rate permitted in the application of hedge accounting. This update will be effective for the Company for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018 and interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted if an entity has adopted ASU 2017-12. The Company is currently assessing the impact of this update on the Companys consolidated financial statements and related disclosures. ASU 2018-02 : Reclassification of Certain Tax Effects from Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income This update allows a reclassification from accumulated other comprehensive income to retained earnings for stranded tax effects resulting from the Tax Cuts and Job Act enacted in December 2017. This update will be effective for the Company for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018 and interim periods within those fiscal years. The Company does not expect this standard to have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements. ASU 2016-13 : Financial Instruments - Credit Losses This update introduces the current expected credit loss (CECL) model, which will require an entity to measure credit losses for certain financial instruments and financial assets, including trade receivables. Under this update, on initial recognition and at each reporting period, an entity will be required to recognize an allowance that reflects the entitys current estimate of credit losses expected to be incurred over the life of the financial instrument. This update will be effective for the Company for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019 and interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently assessing the impact of this update on the Companys consolidated financial statements and related disclosures. ASU 2016-02 : Leases This update requires the recognition of lease assets and lease liabilities on the balance sheet for all lease obligations and disclosing key information about leasing arrangements. This update requires the recognition of lease assets and lease liabilities by lessees for those leases classified as operating leases under current generally accepted accounting principles. This update will be effective for the Company for all annual periods beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years. The Company will apply the new standard at its adoption date rather than at the earliest comparative period  ##TABLE_START  ##TABLE_END presented in the financial statements. The Companys operating leases will result in the recognition of additional assets and the corresponding liabilities on its Consolidated Balance Sheets. The adoption of this standard will not have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements. Cash Equivalents The Company classifies all highly liquid investments with stated maturities of three months or less from date of purchase as cash equivalents and all highly liquid investments with stated maturities of greater than three months from the date of purchase as current marketable securities. The Company has a policy of making investments only with commercial institutions that have at least an investment grade credit rating. The Company invests its cash primarily in government securities and obligations, corporate debt securities, money market funds and reverse repurchase agreements (RRAs). RRAs are collateralized by deposits in the form of Government Securities and Obligations for an amount not less than 102% of their value. The Company does not record an asset or liability as the Company is not permitted to sell or repledge the associated collateral. The Company has a policy that the collateral has at least an A (or equivalent) credit rating. The Company utilizes a third party custodian to manage the exchange of funds and ensure that collateral received is maintained at 102% of the value of the RRAs on a daily basis. RRAs with stated maturities of greater than three months from the date of purchase are classified as marketable securities. Investments Investments classified as held to maturity investments are reported at amortized cost and realized gains or losses are reported in earnings. Investments classified as available-for-sale are carried at estimated fair value with unrealized gains and losses recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income. Available-for-sale securities available for current operations are classified as current assets otherwise, they are classified as long term. Management determines the appropriate classification of its investment in debt and equity securities at the time of purchase and re-evaluates such determination at each balance sheet date. The Company reviews its investments in equity securities for impairment and adjusts these investments to fair value through earnings, as required. Property, Plant and Equipment and Depreciation Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost. The Company utilizes the straight-line method of depreciation over the estimated useful lives of the assets: ##TABLE_START Building and building equipment 20 - 30 years Land and leasehold improvements 10 - 20 years Machinery and equipment 2 - 13 years ##TABLE_ENDThe Company capitalizes certain computer software and development costs, included in machinery and equipment, when incurred in connection with developing or obtaining computer software for internal use. Capitalized software costs are amortized over the estimated useful lives of the software, which generally range from 3 to 8 years. The Company reviews long-lived assets to assess recoverability using undiscounted cash flows. When certain events or changes in operating or economic conditions occur, an impairment assessment may be performed on the recoverability of the carrying value of these assets. If the asset is determined to be impaired, the loss is measured based on the difference between the assets fair value and its carrying value. If quoted market prices are not available, the Company will estimate fair value using a discounted value of estimated future cash flows. Revenue Recognition The Company recognizes revenue from product sales when obligations under the terms of a contract with the customer are satisfied; generally, this occurs with the transfer of control of the goods to customers. The Company's global payment terms are typically between 30 to 90 days. Provisions for certain rebates, sales incentives, trade promotions, coupons, product returns and discounts to customers are accounted for as variable consideration and recorded as a reduction in sales. Product discounts granted are based on the terms of arrangements with direct, indirect and other market participants, as well as market conditions, including consideration of competitor pricing. Rebates are estimated based on contractual terms, historical experience, patient outcomes, trend analysis and projected market conditions in the various markets served. The Company evaluates market conditions for products or groups of products primarily through the analysis of wholesaler and other third-party sell-through and market research data, as well as internally generated information. Sales returns are estimated and recorded based on historical sales and returns information. Products that exhibit unusual sales or return patterns due to dating, competition or other marketing matters are specifically investigated and analyzed as part of the accounting for sales return accruals. Sales returns allowances represent a reserve for products that may be returned due to expiration, destruction in the field, or in specific areas, product recall. The sales returns reserve is based on historical return trends by product and by market as a percent to gross sales. In accordance with the Companys accounting policies, the Company generally issues credit to  ##TABLE_START  ##TABLE_END customers for returned goods. The Companys sales returns reserves are accounted for in accordance with the U.S. GAAP guidance for revenue recognition when right of return exists. Sales returns reserves are recorded at full sales value. Sales returns in the Consumer and Pharmaceutical segments are almost exclusively not resalable. Sales returns for certain franchises in the Medical Devices segment are typically resalable but are not material. The Company infrequently exchanges products from inventory for returned products. The sales returns reserve for the total Company has been approximately 1.0% of annual net trade sales during the fiscal reporting years 2018, 2017 and 2016. Promotional programs, such as product listing allowances and cooperative advertising arrangements, are recorded in the same period as related sales. Continuing promotional programs include coupons and volume-based sales incentive programs. The redemption cost of consumer coupons is based on historical redemption experience by product and value. Volume-based incentive programs are based on the estimated sales volumes for the incentive period and are recorded as products are sold. These arrangements are evaluated to determine the appropriate amounts to be deferred or recorded as a reduction of revenue. The Company also earns profit-share payments through collaborative arrangements for certain products, which are included in sales to customers. For all years presented, profit-share payments were less than 2.0% of the total revenues and are included in sales to customers. Shipping and Handling Shipping and handling costs incurred were $1,090 million , $1,042 million and $974 million in 2018 , 2017 and 2016 , respectively, and are included in selling, marketing and administrative expense. The amount of revenue received for shipping and handling is less than 0.5% of sales to customers for all periods presented. Inventories Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value determined by the first-in, first-out method. Intangible Assets and Goodwill The authoritative literature on U.S. GAAP requires that goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives be assessed annually for impairment. The Company completed the annual impairment test for 2018 in the fiscal fourth quarter. Future impairment tests will be performed annually in the fiscal fourth quarter, or sooner if warranted. Purchased in-process research and development is accounted for as an indefinite lived intangible asset until the underlying project is completed, at which point the intangible asset will be accounted for as a definite lived intangible asset, or abandoned, at which point the intangible asset will be written off or partially impaired. Intangible assets that have finite useful lives continue to be amortized over their useful lives, and are reviewed for impairment when warranted by economic conditions. See Note 5 for further details on Intangible Assets and Goodwill. Financial Instruments As required by U.S. GAAP, all derivative instruments are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value. Fair value is the exit price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability. Fair value is a market-based measurement determined using assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability. The authoritative literature establishes a three-level hierarchy to prioritize the inputs used in measuring fair value, with Level 1 having the highest priority and Level 3 having the lowest. Changes in the fair value of derivatives are recorded each period in current earnings or other comprehensive income, depending on whether the derivative is designated as part of a hedge transaction, and if so, the type of hedge transaction. The Company documents all relationships between hedged items and derivatives. The overall risk management strategy includes reasons for undertaking hedge transactions and entering into derivatives. The objectives of this strategy are: (1) minimize foreign currency exposures impact on the Companys financial performance; (2) protect the Companys cash flow from adverse movements in foreign exchange rates; (3) ensure the appropriateness of financial instruments; and (4) manage the enterprise risk associated with financial institutions. See Note 6 for additional information on Financial Instruments. Product Liability Accruals for product liability claims are recorded, on an undiscounted basis, when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the liability can be reasonably estimated based on existing information and actuarially determined estimates where applicable. The accruals are adjusted periodically as additional information becomes available. The Company accrues an estimate of the legal defense costs needed to defend each matter when those costs are probable and can be reasonably estimated. To the extent adverse verdicts have been rendered against the Company, the Company does not record an accrual until a loss is determined to be probable and can be reasonably estimated. As a result of cost and availability factors, effective November 1, 2005, the Company ceased purchasing third-party product liability insurance. The Company has self insurance through a wholly-owned captive insurance company. In addition to accruals in the self insurance program, claims that exceed the insurance coverage are accrued when losses are probable and amounts can be reasonably estimated.  ##TABLE_START  ##TABLE_END Research and Development Research and development expenses are expensed as incurred in accordance with ASC 730, Research and Development. Upfront and milestone payments made to third parties in connection with research and development collaborations are expensed as incurred up to the point of regulatory approval. Payments made to third parties subsequent to regulatory approval are capitalized and amortized over the remaining useful life of the related product. Amounts capitalized for such payments are included in other intangibles, net of accumulated amortization. The Company enters into collaborative arrangements, typically with other pharmaceutical or biotechnology companies, to develop and commercialize drug candidates or intellectual property. These arrangements typically involve two (or more) parties who are active participants in the collaboration and are exposed to significant risks and rewards dependent on the commercial success of the activities. These collaborations usually involve various activities by one or more parties, including research and development, marketing and selling and distribution. Often, these collaborations require upfront, milestone and royalty or profit share payments, contingent upon the occurrence of certain future events linked to the success of the asset in development. Amounts due from collaborative partners related to development activities are generally reflected as a reduction of research and development expense because the performance of contract development services is not central to the Companys operations. In general, the income statement presentation for these collaborations is as follows: ##TABLE_START Nature/Type of Collaboration  Statement of Earnings Presentation Third-party sale of product  profit share payments received  Sales to customers Royalties/milestones paid to collaborative partner (post-regulatory approval)*  Cost of products sold Royalties received from collaborative partner  Other income (expense), net Upfront payments  milestones paid to collaborative partner (pre-regulatory approval)  Research and development expense Research and development payments to collaborative partner  Research and development expense Research and development payments received from collaborative partner  Reduction of Research and development expense ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START * Milestones are capitalized as intangible assets and amortized to cost of products sold over the useful life. ##TABLE_ENDFor all years presented, there was no individual project that represented greater than 5% of the total annual consolidated research and development expense. The Company has a number of products and compounds developed in collaboration with strategic partners including XARELTO  , co-developed with Bayer HealthCare AG and IMBRUVICA  , developed in collaboration and co-marketed with Pharmacyclics LLC, an AbbVie company. The Company has a number of licensing arrangements for products and compounds including DARZALEX  , licensed from Genmab A/S.  Advertising Costs associated with advertising are expensed in the year incurred and are included in selling, marketing and administrative expenses. Advertising expenses worldwide, which comprised television, radio, print media and Internet advertising, were $2.6 billion , $2.5 billion and $2.4 billion in 2018 , 2017 and 2016 , respectively. Income Taxes Income taxes are recorded based on amounts refundable or payable for the current year and include the results of any difference between U.S. GAAP accounting and tax reporting, recorded as deferred tax assets or liabilities. The Company estimates deferred tax assets and liabilities based on enacted tax regulations and rates. Future changes in tax laws and rates may affect recorded deferred tax assets and liabilities in the future. The Company has unrecognized tax benefits for uncertain tax positions. The Company follows U.S. GAAP which prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. Management believes that changes in these estimates would not have a material effect on the Company's results of operations, cash flows or financial position. In the fourth fiscal quarter of 2018, the Company has elected to account for the GILTI tax under the deferred method. The deferred tax amounts recorded are based on the evaluation of temporary differences that are expected to reverse as GILTI is incurred. The Company has recorded deferred tax liabilities on all undistributed earnings prior to December 31, 2017 from its international subsidiaries. The Company has not provided deferred taxes on the undistributed earnings subsequent to January 1, 2018 from certain international subsidiaries where the earnings are considered to be indefinitely reinvested. The Company intends to continue to reinvest these earnings in those international operations. If the Company decides at a later date to  ##TABLE_START  ##TABLE_END repatriate these earnings to the U.S., the Company would be required to provide for the net tax effects on these amounts. The Company estimates that the total tax effect of this repatriation would be approximately $0.7 billion under current enacted tax laws and regulations and at current currency exchange rates. See Note 8 for further information regarding income taxes. Net Earnings Per Share Basic earnings per share is computed by dividing net earnings available to common shareholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the period. Diluted earnings per share reflects the potential dilution that could occur if securities were exercised or converted into common stock using the treasury stock method. Use of Estimates The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported. Estimates are used when accounting for sales discounts, rebates, allowances and incentives, product liabilities, income taxes, withholding taxes, depreciation, amortization, employee benefits, contingencies and intangible asset and liability valuations. Actual results may or may not differ from those estimates. The Company follows the provisions of U.S. GAAP when recording litigation related contingencies. A liability is recorded when a loss is probable and can be reasonably estimated. The best estimate of a loss within a range is accrued; however, if no estimate in the range is better than any other, the minimum amount is accrued. Annual Closing Date The Company follows the concept of a fiscal year, which ends on the Sunday nearest to the end of the month of December. Normally each fiscal year consists of 52 weeks, but every five or six years the fiscal year consists of 53 weeks , and therefore includes additional shipping days, as was the case in 2015, and will be the case again in 2020. Reclassification Certain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to current year presentation. ##TABLE_START 2.

Inventories ##TABLE_END At the end of 2018 and 2017 , inventories were comprised of: ##TABLE_START (Dollars in Millions)   Raw materials and supplies  $ 1,114  1,140 Goods in process  2,109  2,317 Finished goods  5,376  5,308 Total inventories  $ 8,599 (1) 8,765 ##TABLE_END(1)  Net of assets held for sale on the Consolidated Balance Sheet for approximately $0.2 billion related to the divestiture of the Advanced Sterilization Products business and $0.3 billion related to the strategic collaboration with Jabil Inc., both of which were pending as of December 30, 2018.  ##TABLE_START  ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START 4. Property, Plant and Equipment ##TABLE_END At the end of 2018 and 2017 , property, plant and equipment at cost and accumulated depreciation were: ##TABLE_START (Dollars in Millions)   Land and land improvements  $  Buildings and building equipment  11,176  11,240 Machinery and equipment  25,992  25,949 Construction in progress  3,876  3,448 Total property, plant and equipment, gross  $ 41,851  41,466 Less accumulated depreciation  24,816  24,461 Total property, plant and equipment, net  $ 17,035 (1)  17,005 ##TABLE_END(1)  Net of assets held for sale on the Consolidated Balance Sheet for approximately $0.1 billion related to the divestiture of the Advanced Sterilization Products business and $0.1 billion related to the strategic collaboration with Jabil Inc., both of which were pending as of December 30, 2018. The Company capitalizes interest expense as part of the cost of construction of facilities and equipment. Interest expense capitalized in 2018 , 2017 and 2016 was $86 million , $94 million and $102 million , respectively. Depreciation expense, including the amortization of capitalized interest in 2018 , 2017 and 2016 was $2.6 billion , $2.6 billion and $2.5 billion , respectively. Upon retirement or other disposal of property, plant and equipment, the costs and related amounts of accumulated depreciation or amortization are eliminated from the asset and accumulated depreciation accounts, respectively. The difference, if any, between the net asset value and the proceeds are recorded in earnings. ##TABLE_START 5. Intangible Assets and Goodwill ##TABLE_END At the end of 2018 and 2017 , the gross and net amounts of intangible assets were: ##TABLE_START (Dollars in Millions)   Intangible assets with definite lives:     Patents and trademarks  gross  $ 35,194  36,427 Less accumulated amortization  9,784  7,223 Patents and trademarks  net  $ 25,410  29,204 Customer relationships and other intangibles  gross  $ 21,334  20,204 Less accumulated amortization  8,323  7,463 Customer relationships and other intangibles  net  $ 13,011  12,741 Intangible assets with indefinite lives:     Trademarks  $ 6,937  7,082 Purchased in-process research and development (1)  2,253  4,201 Total intangible assets with indefinite lives  $ 9,190  11,283 Total intangible assets  net  $ 47,611  53,228 ##TABLE_END(1) The decrease was primarily attributable to the write-down of $1.1 billion related to the assets acquired in the acquisitions of Alios Biopharma Inc. (Alios) and XO1 Limited (XO1). Of the $1.1 billion , the Company recorded a partial impairment charge of $0.8 billion related to the development program of AL-8176, an investigational drug for the treatment of Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) and human metapneumovirus (hMPV) acquired with the 2014 acquisition of Alios. The impairment charge was calculated based on updated cash flow projections discounted for the inherent risk in the asset development and reflects the impact of the phase 2b clinical trial suspension, a decrease in the probability of success factors and the ongoing analysis of asset development activities. In addition, an impairment charge of $0.3 billion was recorded for the discontinuation of the development project for an anti-thrombin antibody associated with the 2015 acquisition of XO1. Additionally, $0.8 billion of IPRD related to ERLEADA  was reclassified to definite lived intangible assets upon commercialization.  ##TABLE_START  ##TABLE_END Goodwill as of December 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017 , as allocated by segment of business, was as follows: ##TABLE_START (Dollars in Millions)  Consumer  Pharmaceutical  Medical Devices  Total Goodwill at January 1, 2017  $ 8,263  2,840  11,702  22,805 Goodwill, related to acquisitions (1)   6,161  2,200  8,463 Goodwill, related to divestitures  (74 )  (1 )  (102 )  (177 ) Currency translation/other     Goodwill at December 31, 2017  $ 8,875  9,109  13,922  31,906 Goodwill, related to acquisitions     Goodwill, related to divestitures      (1,348 ) (2)  (1,348 ) Currency translation/other  (373 )  (97 )  (38 )  (508 ) Goodwill at December 30, 2018  $ 8,670  9,063  12,720  30,453 ##TABLE_END(1) Goodwill of $6.2 billion related to the Actelion acquisition acquired in the fiscal second quarter of 2017, within the Pharmaceutical segment and $1.7 billion related to the AMO acquisition acquired in the fiscal first quarter of 2017, within the Medical Devices segment. (2) Goodwill of $1.0 billion is related to the divestiture of the LifeScan business. Goodwill of $0.3 billion is related to the divestiture of the Advanced Sterilization Products business, which was pending and classified as assets held for sale on the Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 30, 2018. The weighted average amortization periods for patents and trademarks and customer relationships and other intangible assets are 11 years and 22 years , respectively. The amortization expense of amortizable assets included in cost of products sold was $4.4 billion , $3.0 billion and $1.2 billion before tax, for the fiscal years ended December 30, 2018 , December 31, 2017 and January 1, 2017 , respectively. The estimated amortization expense for the five succeeding years approximates $4.3 billion before tax, per year. Intangible asset write-downs are included in Other (income) expense, net. See Note 20 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional details related to acquisitions and divestitures. ##TABLE_START 6. Fair Value Measurements ##TABLE_END The Company uses forward foreign exchange contracts to manage its exposure to the variability of cash flows, primarily related to the foreign exchange rate changes of future intercompany products and third-party purchases of materials denominated in a foreign currency. The Company uses cross currency interest rate swaps to manage currency risk primarily related to borrowings. Both types of derivatives are designated as cash flow hedges. Additionally, the Company uses interest rate swaps as an instrument to manage interest rate risk related to fixed rate borrowings. These derivatives are designated as fair value hedges. The Company uses cross currency interest rate swaps and forward foreign exchange contracts designated as net investment hedges. Additionally, the Company uses forward foreign exchange contracts to offset its exposure to certain foreign currency assets and liabilities. These forward foreign exchange contracts are not designated as hedges and therefore, changes in the fair values of these derivatives are recognized in earnings, thereby offsetting the current earnings effect of the related foreign currency assets and liabilities. The Company early adopted ASU 2017-12: Targeted Improvements to Accounting for Hedge Activities effective as of the beginning of fiscal second quarter of 2018. The Company does not enter into derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes, or that contain credit risk related contingent features. During the fiscal second quarter of 2017, the Company entered into credit support agreements (CSA) with certain derivative counterparties establishing collateral thresholds based on respective credit ratings and netting agreements. As of December 30, 2018 , the total amount of collateral paid under the credit support agreements (CSA) amounted to $182 million net. On an ongoing basis, the Company monitors counter-party credit ratings. The Company considers credit non-performance risk to be low, because the Company primarily enters into agreements with commercial institutions that have at least an investment grade credit rating. Refer to the table on significant financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value contained in this footnote for receivables and payables with these commercial institutions. As of December 30, 2018 , the Company had notional amounts outstanding for forward foreign exchange contracts, cross currency interest rate swaps and interest rate swaps of $41.1 billion , $7.3 billion , and $0.5 billion respectively. As of December 31, 2017 , the Company had notional amounts outstanding for forward foreign exchange contracts, cross currency interest rate swaps and interest rate swaps of $34.5 billion , $2.3 billion , and $1.1 billion respectively.  ##TABLE_START  ##TABLE_END All derivative instruments are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value. Changes in the fair value of derivatives are recorded each period in current earnings or other comprehensive income, depending on whether the derivative is designated as part of a hedge transaction, and if so, the type of hedge transaction. The designation as a cash flow hedge is made at the entrance date of the derivative contract. At inception, all derivatives are expected to be highly effective. Foreign exchange contracts designated as cash flow hedges are accounted for under the forward method and all gains/losses associated with these contracts will be recognized in the income statement when the hedged item impacts earnings. Changes in the fair value of these derivatives are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income until the underlying transaction affects earnings, and are then reclassified to earnings in the same account as the hedged transaction. Gains and losses associated with interest rate swaps and changes in fair value of hedged debt attributable to changes in interest rates are recorded to interest expense in the period in which they occur. Gains and losses on net investment hedge are accounted through the currency translation account within accumulated other comprehensive income. The portion excluded from effectiveness testing is recorded through interest (income) expense using the spot method. On an ongoing basis, the Company assesses whether each derivative continues to be highly effective in offsetting changes of hedged items. If and when a derivative is no longer expected to be highly effective, hedge accounting is discontinued. During the fiscal second quarter of 2016, the Company designated its Euro denominated notes issued in May 2016 with due dates ranging from 2022 to 2035 as a net investment hedge of the Company's investments in certain of its international subsidiaries that use the Euro as their functional currency in order to reduce the volatility caused by changes in exchange rates. As of December 30, 2018 , the balance of deferred net loss on derivatives included in accumulated other comprehensive income was $195 million after-tax. For additional information, see the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income and Note 13. The Company expects that substantially all of the amounts related to forward foreign exchange contracts will be reclassified into earnings over the next 12 months as a result of transactions that are expected to occur over that period. The maximum length of time over which the Company is hedging transaction exposure is 18 months , excluding interest rate contracts, net investment hedges and equity collar contracts. The amount ultimately realized in earnings may differ as foreign exchange rates change. Realized gains and losses are ultimately determined by actual exchange rates at maturity of the derivative.  ##TABLE_START  ##TABLE_END The following table is a summary of the activity related to derivatives and hedges for the fiscal years ended December 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017 : ##TABLE_START  December 30, 2018 December 31, 2017 (Dollars in Millions) Sales Cost of Products Sold RD Expense Interest (Income) Expense Other (Income) Expense Sales Cost of Products Sold RD Expense Interest (Income) Expense Other (Income) Expense The effects of fair value, net investment and cash flow hedging:           Gain (Loss) on fair value hedging relationship:           Interest rate swaps contracts:           Hedged items $         Derivatives designated as hedging instruments    (5 )     (5 )             Gain (Loss) on net investment hedging relationship:           Cross currency interest rate swaps contracts:           Amount of gain or (loss) recognized in income on derivative amount excluded from effectiveness testing          Amount of gain or (loss) recognized in AOCI                     Gain (Loss) on cash flow hedging relationship:           Forward foreign exchange contracts:           Amount of gain or (loss) reclassified from AOCI into income (1) 200 (220 )  (24 ) (31 ) (159 ) (165 )  (87 )            Amount of gain or (loss) recognized in AOCI (1) (32 ) (17 ) (193 )  (4 ) 96 (199 )  (60 )            Cross currency interest rate swaps contracts:           Amount of gain or (loss) reclassified from AOCI into income         Amount of gain or (loss) recognized in AOCI $         ##TABLE_END(1) Includes equity collar contracts.

This ASU amends prior guidance to classify equity investments with readily determinable market values into different categories (that is, trading or available-for-sale) and require equity investments to be measured at fair value with changes in fair value recognized through net earnings. The Company made a cumulative effect adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings upon adoption of ASU 2016-01 which increased retained earnings by $232 million , net of tax, and decreased accumulated other comprehensive income for previously net unrealized gains from equity investments. The Company holds equity investments with readily determinable fair values and equity investments without readily determinable fair values. The Company has elected to measure equity investments that do not have readily determinable fair values at cost minus impairment, if any, plus or minus changes resulting from observable price changes in orderly transactions for the identical or a similar investment of the same issuer. The following table is a summary of the activity related to equity investments as of December 30, 2018 : ##TABLE_START (Dollars in Millions)  December 31, 2017      December 30, 2018     Carrying Value  Changes in Fair Value Reflected in Net Income (1)  Sales/ Purchases/Other (2)  Carrying Value  Non Current Other Assets Equity Investments with readily determinable value  $  (247 )               Equity Investments without readily determinable value  $     ##TABLE_END (1)  Recorded in Other Income/Expense (2)  Other includes impact of currency For equity investments without readily determinable market values, $54 million of the changes in fair value reflected in net income were the result of impairments. There were $67 million of changes in fair value reflected in net income due to changes in observable prices.  ##TABLE_START  ##TABLE_END For the fiscal years ended December 31, 2017 , changes in fair value reflected within other comprehensive income due to previously unrealized gains on equity investments with readily determinable fair values net of tax was a net gain of $232 million . Fair value is the exit price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability. Fair value is a market-based measurement determined using assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability. The authoritative literature establishes a three-level hierarchy to prioritize the inputs used in measuring fair value. The levels within the hierarchy are described below with Level 1 having the highest priority and Level 3 having the lowest. The fair value of a derivative financial instrument (i.e., forward foreign exchange contracts, interest rate contracts) is the aggregation by currency of all future cash flows discounted to its present value at the prevailing market interest rates and subsequently converted to the U.S. Dollar at the current spot foreign exchange rate. The Company does not believe that fair values of these derivative instruments materially differ from the amounts that could be realized upon settlement or maturity, or that the changes in fair value will have a material effect on the Companys results of operations, cash flows or financial position. The Company also holds equity investments which are classified as Level 1 and debt securities which are classified as Level 2. The Company did not have any other significant financial assets or liabilities which would require revised valuations under this standard that are recognized at fair value.

In September 2018 , the Company secured a new 364-day Credit Facility. Total credit available to the Company approximates $10 billion , which expires on September 12, 2019 . Interest charged on borrowings under the credit line agreements is based on either bids provided by banks, the prime rate or London Interbank Offered Rates (LIBOR), plus applicable margins. Commitment fees under the agreements are not material. Throughout 2018 , the Company continued to have access to liquidity through the commercial paper market. Short-term borrowings and the current portion of long-term debt amounted to approximately $2.8 billion at the end of 2018 , of which $2.6 billion is the current portion of the long term debt, and the remainder principally represents local borrowing by international subsidiaries. Throughout 2017, the Company continued to have access to liquidity through the commercial paper market. Short-term borrowings and the current portion of long-term debt amounted to approximately $3.9 billion at the end of 2017, of which $2.3 billion was borrowed under the Commercial Paper Program, $1.5 billion is the current portion of the long-term debt, and the remainder principally represents local borrowing by international subsidiaries.

International operations reflects the impacts of operations in jurisdictions with statutory tax rates different than the U.S., particularly Ireland, Switzerland and Puerto Rico, which is a favorable impact on the effective tax rate as compared with the U.S. statutory rate. The 2017 amount also includes tax cost related to the revaluation of deferred tax balances related to the change in the Belgian statutory tax rate increasing the tax provision by approximately 3.4% . (2) Includes the impact of the GILTI tax, the Foreign-Derived Intangible Income deduction and other foreign income that is taxable under the U.S. tax code. (3) Represents impact of adjustments to the 2017 TCJA provisional tax charge. This also includes a net tax benefit from the reduction of a deferred tax liability related to foreign withholding taxes originally accrued as part of the provisional charge. This benefit reduced the Companys effective tax rate by approximately 11% . Further description is included below. (4) Includes U.S. state and local taxes provisionally recorded as part TCJA provisional charge which was approximately 0.6% of the total effective tax rate. On December 22, 2017, the United States enacted into law new U.S. tax legislation, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA). This law included provisions for a comprehensive overhaul of the corporate income tax code, including a reduction of the statutory corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%, effective on January 1, 2018. This legislation also eliminated or reduced certain corporate income tax deductions as well as introduced new provisions that taxed certain foreign income not previously taxed by the United States. The TCJA also included a provision for a tax on all previously undistributed earnings of U.S. companies located in foreign jurisdictions. Undistributed earnings in the form of cash and cash equivalents were taxed at a rate of 15.5% and all other earnings are taxed at a rate of 8.0%. This tax is payable over 8 years and will not accrue interest and these payments began in 2018 and will continue through 2025. The remaining balance at the end of the fiscal year 2018 was approximately $8.2 billion . In December 2017, the SEC provided regulatory guidance for accounting of the impacts of the TCJA, referred to as SAB 118. Under the guidance in SAB 118, the income tax effects, which the accounting under ASC 740 is incomplete, are reported as a provisional amount based on a reasonable estimate. The reasonable estimate is subject to adjustment during a \"measurement period\", not to exceed one year, until the accounting is complete. The estimate is also subject to the finalization of managements analysis related to certain matters, such as developing interpretations of the provision of the TCJA, changes to certain estimates and amounts related to the earnings and profits of certain subsidiaries and the filing of tax returns. In the fourth quarter of 2017, the Company recorded a provisional tax cost of approximately $13.0 billion which consisted primarily of the following components: ##TABLE_START  a $10.1 billion charge on previously undistributed foreign earnings as of December 31, 2017 ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  a $4.5 billion deferred tax liability for foreign local and withholding taxes, offset by a $1.1 billion deferred tax asset for U.S. foreign tax credits, for repatriation of substantially all those earnings ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  a $0.6 billion tax benefit relating to the remeasurement of U.S. deferred tax assets and liabilities and the impact of the TCJA on unrecognized tax benefits ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  a $0.1 billion charge for U.S. state and local taxes on the repatriation of these foreign earnings ##TABLE_END During the fourth quarter of 2018, the Company completed its full assessment and finalized the accounting for the impact of TCJA. The Company recorded net adjustments to the above components of the provisional charge of approximately $0.2 billion . These revisions were based on updated estimates and additional analysis by management as well as applying  ##TABLE_START  ##TABLE_END interpretative guidance issued by the U.S. Department of Treasury to the facts and circumstances that existed as of the TCJA enactment date. This charge was primarily related to additional deferred tax liabilities for foreign local and withholding taxes for the remaining balance of undistributed foreign earnings as of December 31, 2017 that were not provided for in the provisional charge in the fourth quarter of 2017. The TCJA also includes provisions for a tax on global intangible low-taxed income (GILTI). GILTI is described as the excess of a U.S. shareholders total net foreign income over a deemed return on tangible assets, as provided by the TCJA. In January 2018, the FASB issued guidance that allows companies to elect as an accounting policy whether to record the tax effects of GILTI in the period the tax liability is generated (i.e., period cost) or provide for deferred tax assets and liabilities related to basis differences that exist and are expected to effect the amount of GILTI inclusion in future years upon reversal (i.e., deferred method). Through the third fiscal quarter of 2018, the Company had provisionally elected to treat GILTI as a period expense. Upon further analysis of this new tax provision, the Company has elected to account for GILTI under the deferred method. The deferred tax amounts recorded are based on the evaluation of temporary differences that are expected to reverse as GILTI is incurred. As a result of this election, the Company recorded a deferred tax cost related to GILTI of approximately $1.4 billion in the fourth fiscal quarter of 2018 related to facts and circumstances that existed on the date of TCJA enactment. As a result of the GILTI deferred tax charge and the other adjustments to the provisional amount, the Company recorded a total of $1.6 billion of adjustments to the 2017 provisional charge increasing the Companys annual effective tax rate by approximately 9% . During 2018, the Company reorganized the ownership structure of certain foreign subsidiaries which resulted in a reduction of certain foreign withholding taxes that it had recognized as part of the provisional TCJA tax charge in the fourth quarter of 2017. Following the completion of this restructuring in the fourth quarter 2018, and as a result of clarification by Swiss tax authorities regarding the applicability of withholding tax to repatriation of certain earnings, the Company reversed a deferred tax liability of $2.8 billion and a related deferred tax asset of $0.9 billion for U.S. foreign tax credits, for a net deferred tax benefit of $1.9 billion . As this restructuring occurred after the TCJA enactment date, the benefit is not considered an adjustment to the provisional amount recorded in 2017 under SAB118. This benefit with the SAB 118 adjustments has been reflected as TCJA and related impacts on the Companys effective tax rate reconciliation. As described in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, in 2018 the Company adopted ASU 2016-16: Income Taxes: Intra-Entity Transfers of Assets Other Than Inventory. This standard requires entities to recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities related to transfer of assets, other than inventory, within the consolidated entity. At the beginning of fiscal 2018, the Company recorded a net adjustment to deferred tax assets of approximately $2.0 billion . In the fourth quarter of 2018, as a result of the election to record GILTI on the deferred method, the Company recorded a GILTI deferred tax liability of $1.7 billion related to the adoption provisions of ASU 2016-16 as an adjustment to retained earnings. The 2018 effective tax rate decreased by 77.6% compared to 2017. The 2017 effective tax rate was primarily driven by the approximately $13 billion provisional tax charge recorded in the fourth quarter of 2017 and the impact of a Belgian statutory tax rate change which increased the 2017 effective rate by 3.4% . Additional drivers of the 2018 annual effective tax were: ##TABLE_START  the reduction of the U.S. statutory corporate tax rate including the effects of tax elections which resulted in the acceleration of certain deductions into the 2017 tax return. The impact of these accelerated deductions decreased the annual effective tax rate by approximately 1.7%  ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  the impact of the adjustments to the 2017 provisional TCJA charge, including both SAB 118 adjustments and the internal restructuring, decreased the effective tax rate by approximately 1.9%  ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  GILTI tax which increased the annual effective tax rate by approximately 1.6% , which excludes the impact of the SAB 118 adjustment for the adoption of the deferred method for GILTI ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  tax benefits received from stock-based compensation during fiscal 2018 and 2017, reduced the effective tax rate by 1.5% and 2.0% , respectively ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  in the fourth quarter of 2018, the Company completed the divestiture of its LifeScan business (Note 20), which increased the Company annual effective tax rate by approximately 0.8%  ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  more income in higher tax jurisdictions relative to lower tax jurisdictions as compared to 2017 ##TABLE_END The 2017 effective tax rate increased by 76.1% as compared to 2016, primarily driven by the enactment of the TCJA in the U.S. in December 2017. The enactment of the TCJA resulted in a provisional tax charge in the fourth quarter of 2017, of approximately $13.0 billion or approximately 73.3 percentage point increase to the effective tax rate. The remainder of the increase in the tax rate for 2017 was related to the remeasurement of the Companys deferred tax assets in Belgium, as a result of changes in the Belgian statutory corporate tax rate enacted in December 2017, offset by a tax benefit for the closure of the Companys Animas insulin pump business.  ##TABLE_START  ##TABLE_END Temporary differences and carryforwards for 2018 and 2017 were as follows: ##TABLE_START   2018 Deferred Tax  2017 Deferred Tax (Dollars in Millions)  Asset  Liability  Asset  Liability Employee related obligations  $ 2,398   2,259  Stock based compensation     Depreciation  amortization  1,784    (9 ) Non-deductible intangibles   (5,967 )   (6,506 ) International RD capitalized for tax  1,282   1,307  Reserves  liabilities  1,647   1,718  Income reported for tax purposes  1,104   1,316  Net operating loss carryforward international     Undistributed foreign earnings   (2,240 )  1,101  (4,457 ) Global intangible low-taxed income    (2,971 )     Miscellaneous international   (93 )   (194 ) Miscellaneous U.S.     Total deferred income taxes  $ 11,405  (11,271 )  9,902  (11,166 ) ##TABLE_ENDThe Company has wholly-owned international subsidiaries that have cumulative net losses.

The Company conducts business and files tax returns in numerous countries and currently has tax audits in progress with a number of tax authorities. The IRS has completed its audit for the tax years through 2009 and is currently auditing the tax years 2010-2012. The Company currently expects completion of this audit during 2019. Final conclusion of the tax audit may result in an outcome that is different than the Companys estimates and may result in a material impact on the Companys current and future operating results or cash flows in the period that the audit is concluded. In other major jurisdictions where the Company conducts business, the years that remain open to tax audit go back to the year 2006. The Company believes it is possible that audits may be completed by tax authorities in some jurisdictions over the next twelve months. However, the Company is not able to provide a reasonably reliable estimate of the timing of any other future tax payments relating to uncertain tax positions. The Company classifies liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits and related interest and penalties as long-term liabilities. Interest expense and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits are classified as income tax expense. The Company recognized after tax interest expense of $53 million , $60 million and $7 million in 2018 , 2017 and 2016 , respectively. The total amount of accrued interest was $503 million and $436 million in 2018 and 2017 , respectively.  ##TABLE_START  ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START 9.

Pensions and Other Benefit Plans ##TABLE_END The Company sponsors various retirement and pension plans, including defined benefit, defined contribution and termination indemnity plans, which cover most employees worldwide. The Company also provides post-retirement benefits, primarily health care, to all eligible U.S. retired employees and their dependents. Many international employees are covered by government-sponsored programs and the cost to the Company is not significant. Retirement plan benefits for employees hired before January 1, 2015 are primarily based on the employees compensation during the last three to five years before retirement and the number of years of service. In 2014, the Company announced that the U.S. Defined Benefit Plan was amended to adopt a new benefit formula, effective for employees hired on or after January 1, 2015. The benefits are calculated using a new formula based on employee compensation over total years of service. International subsidiaries have plans under which funds are deposited with trustees, annuities are purchased under group contracts, or reserves are provided. The Company does not typically fund retiree health care benefits in advance, but may do so at its discretion. The Company also has the right to modify these plans in the future. In 2018 and 2017 the Company used December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017 , respectively, as the measurement date for all U.S. and international retirement and other benefit plans. Net periodic benefit costs for the Companys defined benefit retirement plans and other benefit plans for 2018 , 2017 and 2016 include the following components: ##TABLE_START   Retirement Plans  Other Benefit Plans (Dollars in Millions)       Service cost  $ 1,283  1,080     Interest cost       Expected return on plan assets  (2,212 )  (2,041 )  (1,962 )  (7 )  (6 )  (6 ) Amortization of prior service cost (credit)     (31 )  (30 )  (34 ) Recognized actuarial losses       Curtailments and settlements          Net periodic benefit cost  $      ##TABLE_ENDIn 2018, as per the adoption of ASU 2017-07, the service cost component of net periodic benefit cost was presented in the same line items on the Consolidated Statement of Earnings where other employee compensation costs are reported. All other components of net periodic benefit cost are presented as part of Other (income) expense, net on the Consolidated Statement of Earnings.  ##TABLE_START  ##TABLE_END Amounts expected to be recognized in net periodic benefit cost in the coming year for the Companys defined benefit retirement plans and other post-retirement plans: ##TABLE_START (Dollars in Millions)  Amortization of net transition obligation $  Amortization of net actuarial losses Amortization of prior service credit ##TABLE_ENDUnrecognized gains and losses for the U.S. pension plans are amortized over the average remaining future service for each plan. For plans with no active employees, they are amortized over the average life expectancy. The amortization of gains and losses for the other U.S. benefit plans is determined by using a 10% corridor of the greater of the market value of assets or the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation. Total unamortized gains and losses in excess of the corridor are amortized over the average remaining future service. Prior service costs/benefits for the U.S. pension plans are amortized over the average remaining future service of plan participants at the time of the plan amendment. Prior service cost/benefit for the other U.S. benefit plans is amortized over the average remaining service to full eligibility age of plan participants at the time of the plan amendment. The following table represents the weighted-average actuarial assumptions: ##TABLE_START   Retirement Plans  Other Benefit Plans Worldwide Benefit Plans       Net Periodic Benefit Cost             Service cost discount rate  3.20 %  3.59  3.98  3.85  4.63  4.77 Interest cost discount rate  3.60 %  3.98  4.24  3.62  3.94  4.10 Rate of increase in compensation levels  3.98 %  4.01  4.02  4.29  4.31  4.32 Expected long-term rate of return on plan assets  8.46 %  8.43  8.55                    Benefit Obligation             Discount rate  3.76 %  3.30  3.78  4.40  3.78  4.42 Rate of increase in compensation levels  3.97 %  3.99  4.02  4.29  4.30  4.29 ##TABLE_ENDThe Companys discount rates are determined by considering current yield curves representing high quality, long-term fixed income instruments. The resulting discount rates are consistent with the duration of plan liabilities. In the fiscal year 2016, the Company changed its methodology in determining service and interest cost from the single weighted average discount rate approach to duration specific spot rates along that yield curve to the plans liability cash flows, which management has concluded is a more precise estimate. Prior to this change in methodology, the Company measured service and interest costs utilizing a single weighted-average discount rate derived from the yield curve used to measure the plan obligations. The Company has accounted for this change as a change in accounting estimate and, accordingly, has accounted for it on a prospective basis. This change does not impact the benefit obligation and did not have a material impact to the 2016 full year results. The expected rates of return on plan asset assumptions represent the Company's assessment of long-term returns on diversified investment portfolios globally. The assessment is determined using projections from external financial sources, long-term historical averages, actual returns by asset class and the various asset class allocations by market.  ##TABLE_START  ##TABLE_END The following table displays the assumed health care cost trend rates, for all individuals: ##TABLE_START Health Care Plans   Health care cost trend rate assumed for next year  6.12 %  6.33 % Rate to which the cost trend rate is assumed to decline (ultimate trend)  4.55 %  4.55 % Year the rate reaches the ultimate trend rate   ##TABLE_ENDA one-percentage-point change in assumed health care cost trend rates would have the following effect: ##TABLE_START   One-Percentage-  One-Percentage- (Dollars in Millions)  Point Increase  Point Decrease Health Care Plans     Total interest and service cost  $  (22 ) Post-retirement benefit obligation  $  (280 ) ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  ##TABLE_END The following table sets forth information related to the benefit obligation and the fair value of plan assets at year-end 2018 and 2017 for the Companys defined benefit retirement plans and other post-retirement plans: ##TABLE_START   Retirement Plans  Other Benefit Plans (Dollars in Millions)     Change in Benefit Obligation         Projected benefit obligation  beginning of year  $ 33,221  28,116  4,582  4,605 Service cost  1,283  1,080   Interest cost     Plan participant contributions       Amendments   (7 )    (17 ) Actuarial (gains) losses  (2,326 )  2,996  (119 )  (166 ) Divestitures  acquisitions  (29 )     Curtailments, settlements  restructuring  (21 )  (35 )    Benefits paid from plan  (1,018 )  (1,050 )  (383 )  (351 ) Effect of exchange rates  (528 )   (17 )  Projected benefit obligation  end of year  $ 31,670  33,221  4,480  4,582 Change in Plan Assets         Plan assets at fair value  beginning of year  $ 28,404  23,633   Actual return on plan assets  (1,269 )  4,274    Company contributions  1,140    Plan participant contributions       Settlements  (13 )  (32 )     Divestitures  acquisitions  (17 )      Benefits paid from plan assets  (1,018 )  (1,050 )  (383 )  (351 ) Effect of exchange rates  (475 )      Plan assets at fair value  end of year  $ 26,818  28,404   Funded status  end of year  $ (4,852 )  (4,817 )  (4,300 )  (4,301 ) Amounts Recognized in the Companys Balance Sheet consist of the following:         Non-current assets  $      Current liabilities  (98 )  (92 )  (281 )  (228 ) Non-current liabilities  (5,229 )  (5,251 )  (4,019 )  (4,073 ) Total recognized in the consolidated balance sheet  end of year  $ (4,852 )  (4,817 )  (4,300 )  (4,301 ) Amounts Recognized in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income consist of the following:         Net actuarial loss  $ 8,323  8,140  1,263  1,500 Prior service cost (credit)   (25 )  (106 )  (137 ) Unrecognized net transition obligation         Total before tax effects  $ 8,325  8,115  1,157  1,363          Accumulated Benefit Obligations  end of year  $ 28,533  29,793                       ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START   Retirement Plans  Other Benefit Plans (Dollars in Millions)     Amounts Recognized in Net Periodic Benefit Cost and Other Comprehensive Income         Net periodic benefit cost  $    Net actuarial (gain) loss  1,153   (111 )  (169 ) Amortization of net actuarial loss  (852 )  (609 )  (123 )  (138 ) Prior service cost (credit)   (7 )    (17 ) Amortization of prior service (cost) credit  (3 )  (2 )   Effect of exchange rates  (114 )   (3 )  Total loss/(income) recognized in other comprehensive income, before tax  $   (206 )  (291 ) Total recognized in net periodic benefit cost and other comprehensive income  $ 1,133    ##TABLE_ENDThe Company plans to continue to fund its U.S. Qualified Plans to comply with the Pension Protection Act of 2006. International Plans are funded in accordance with local regulations. Additional discretionary contributions are made when deemed appropriate to meet the long-term obligations of the plans. For certain plans, funding is not a common practice, as funding provides no economic benefit. Consequently, the Company has several pension plans that are not funded. In 2018 , the Company contributed $679 million and $461 million to its U.S. and international pension plans, respectively. The following table displays the funded status of the Company's U.S. Qualified  Non-Qualified pension plans and international funded and unfunded pension plans at December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively: ##TABLE_START  U.S. Plans International Plans  Qualified Plans Non-Qualified Plans Funded Plans Unfunded Plans (Dollars in Millions) 2017 2017 2017 2017 Plan Assets $ 17,725 18,681   9,093 9,723   Projected Benefit Obligation 18,609 19,652 2,176 2,257 10,467 10,863 449 Accumulated Benefit Obligation 16,851 17,654 1,793 1,849 9,510 9,893 397 Over (Under) Funded Status         Projected Benefit Obligation $ (884 ) (971 ) (2,176 ) (2,257 ) (1,374 ) (1,140 ) (418 ) (449 ) Accumulated Benefit Obligation 1,027 (1,793 ) (1,849 ) (417 ) (170 ) (379 ) (397 ) ##TABLE_ENDPlans with accumulated benefit obligations in excess of plan assets have an accumulated benefit obligation, projected benefit obligation and plan assets of $7.5 billion , $8.8 billion and $4.3 billion , respectively, at the end of 2018 , and $3.8 billion , $4.6 billion and $0.7 billion , respectively, at the end of 2017 .

In determining investment policies, strategies and goals, each committee or board considers factors including, local pension rules and regulations; local tax regulations; availability of investment vehicles (separate accounts, commingled accounts, insurance funds, etc.); funded status of the plans; ratio of actives to retirees; duration of liabilities; and other relevant factors including: diversification, liquidity of local markets and liquidity of base currency. A majority of the Companys pension funds are open to new entrants and are expected to be on-going plans. Permitted investments are primarily liquid and/or listed, with little reliance on illiquid and non-traditional investments such as hedge funds. The Companys retirement plan asset allocation at the end of 2018 and 2017 and target allocations for 2019 are as follows: ##TABLE_START   Percent of Plan Assets  Target Allocation     Worldwide Retirement Plans       Equity securities  %  %  % Debt securities    Total plan assets  %  %  % ##TABLE_ENDDetermination of Fair Value of Plan Assets The Plan has an established and well-documented process for determining fair values. Fair value is based upon quoted market prices, where available. If listed prices or quotes are not available, fair value is based upon models that primarily use, as inputs, market-based or independently sourced market parameters, including yield curves, interest rates, volatilities, equity or debt prices, foreign exchange rates and credit curves. While the Plan believes its valuation methods are appropriate and consistent with other market participants, the use of different methodologies or assumptions to determine the fair value of certain financial instruments could result in a different estimate of fair value at the reporting date. Valuation Hierarchy The authoritative literature establishes a three-level hierarchy to prioritize the inputs used in measuring fair value. The levels within the hierarchy are described in the table below with Level 1 having the highest priority and Level 3 having the lowest. A financial instruments categorization within the valuation hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. Following is a description of the valuation methodologies used for the investments measured at fair value. ##TABLE_START  Short-term investment funds  Cash and quoted short-term instruments are valued at the closing price or the amount held on deposit by the custodian bank. Other investments are through investment vehicles valued using the Net Asset Value (NAV) provided by the administrator of the fund. The NAV is based on the value of the underlying assets owned by the fund, minus its liabilities, and then divided by the number of shares outstanding. The NAV is a quoted price in a market that is not active and classified as Level 2. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Government and agency securities  A limited number of these investments are valued at the closing price reported on the major market on which the individual securities are traded. Where quoted prices are available in an active market, the investments are classified within Level 1 of the valuation hierarchy. If quoted market prices are not available for the specific security, then fair values are estimated by using pricing models, quoted prices of securities with similar characteristics or discounted cash flows. When quoted market prices for a security are not available in an active market, they are classified as Level 2. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Debt instruments  A limited number of these investments are valued at the closing price reported on the major market on which the individual securities are traded. Where quoted prices are available in an active market, the investments are classified as Level 1. If quoted market prices are not available for the specific security, then fair values are estimated by using pricing models, quoted prices of securities with similar characteristics or discounted cash flows and are classified as Level 2. Level 3 debt instruments are priced based on unobservable inputs. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Equity securities  Equity securities are valued at the closing price reported on the major market on which the individual securities are traded. Substantially all common stock is classified within Level 1 of the valuation hierarchy. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Commingled funds  These investment vehicles are valued using the NAV provided by the fund administrator. The NAV is based on the value of the underlying assets owned by the fund, minus its liabilities, and then divided by the number of shares outstanding. Assets in the Level 2 category have a quoted market price. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  Insurance contracts  The instruments are issued by insurance companies. The fair value is based on negotiated value and the underlying investments held in separate account portfolios as well as considering the credit worthiness of the issuer. The underlying investments are government, asset-backed and fixed income securities. In general, insurance contracts are classified as Level 3 as there are no quoted prices nor other observable inputs for pricing. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Other assets  Other assets are represented primarily by limited partnerships and real estate investments, as well as commercial loans and commercial mortgages that are not classified as corporate debt. Other assets that are exchange listed and actively traded are classified as Level 1, while inactively traded assets are classified as Level 2. ##TABLE_END The following table sets forth the Retirement Plans' investments measured at fair value as of December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017: ##TABLE_START   Quoted Prices in Active Markets for Identical Assets  Significant Other Observable Inputs  Significant Unobservable Inputs (a)  Investments Measured at Net Asset Value       (Level 1)  (Level 2)  (Level 3)      Total Assets (Dollars in Millions)           Short-term investment funds  $              Government and agency securities      3,595  3,094          3,595  3,094 Debt instruments      3,105  2,013          3,105  2,013 Equity securities  11,298  13,848             11,302  13,848 Commingled funds      2,304  1,780    5,201  6,158  7,638  7,995 Insurance contracts                 Other assets               Investments at fair value  $ 11,420  14,277  9,570  7,435    5,502  6,436  26,818  28,404 ##TABLE_END(a)  The activity for the Level 3 assets is not significant for all years presented.

International Currency Translation ##TABLE_END For translation of its subsidiaries operating in non-U.S. Dollar currencies, the Company has determined that the local currencies of its international subsidiaries are the functional currencies except those in highly inflationary economies, which are defined as those which have had compound cumulative rates of inflation of 100% or more during the past three years , or where a substantial portion of its cash flows are not in the local currency. Beginning in the fiscal third quarter of 2018, the Company accounted for operations in Argentina as highly inflationary. For the majority of the Company's subsidiaries the local currency is the functional currency. In consolidating international subsidiaries, balance sheet currency effects are recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income. This equity account includes the results of translating certain balance sheet assets and liabilities at current exchange rates and some accounts at historical rates, except for those located in highly inflationary economies. The translation of balance sheet accounts for highly inflationary economies are reflected in the operating results. A rollforward of the changes during 2018 , 2017 and 2016 for foreign currency translation adjustments is included in Note 13. Net currency transaction gains and losses included in Other (income) expense were losses of $265 million , $216 million and $289 million in 2018 , 2017 and 2016 , respectively. ##TABLE_START 15.

Common Stock, Stock Option Plans and Stock Compensation Agreements ##TABLE_END At December 30, 2018 , the Company had 2 stock-based compensation plans. The shares outstanding are for contracts under the Company's 2005 Long-Term Incentive Plan and the 2012 Long-Term Incentive Plan. The 2005 Long-Term Incentive Plan expired April 26, 2012. All options and restricted shares granted subsequent to that date were under the 2012 Long-Term Incentive Plan. Under the 2012 Long-Term Incentive Plan, the Company may issue up to 650 million shares of common stock, plus any shares canceled, expired, forfeited, or not issued from the 2005 Long-Term Incentive Plan subsequent to April 26, 2012. Shares available for future grants under the 2012 Long-Term Incentive Plan were 351 million at the end of 2018 . The compensation cost that has been charged against income for these plans was $978 million , $962 million and $878 million for 2018 , 2017 and 2016 , respectively. The total income tax benefit recognized in the income statement for share-based compensation costs was $192 million , $275 million and $256 million for 2018 , 2017 and 2016 , respectively. An additional tax benefit of $353 million was recognized in 2016 due to the adoption of a new accounting standard for the reporting of additional tax benefits on share-based compensation. The total unrecognized compensation cost was $827 million , $798 million and $749 million for 2018 , 2017 and 2016 , respectively. The weighted average period for this cost to be recognized was 1.73 years, 1.76 years and 1.09 years for 2018 , 2017 , and 2016 , respectively. Share-based compensation costs capitalized as part of inventory were insignificant in all periods. The Company settles employee benefit equity issuances with treasury shares. Treasury shares are replenished throughout the year for the number of shares used to settle employee benefit equity issuances. Stock Options Stock options expire 10 years from the date of grant and vest over service periods that range from 6 months to 4 years . All options are granted at the average of the high and low prices of the Companys Common Stock on the New York Stock Exchange on the date of grant. The fair value of each option award was estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option valuation model that uses the assumptions noted in the following table. For 2018, 2017 and 2016 grants, expected volatility represents a blended rate of 10-year weekly historical overall volatility rate, and a 5-week average implied volatility rate based on at-the-money traded Johnson  Johnson options with a life of 2 years. For all grants, historical data is used to determine the expected life of the option. The risk-free rate was based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant.

Restricted Share Units and Performance Share Units The Company grants restricted share units which vest over service periods that range from 6 months to 3 years . The Company also grants performance share units, which are paid in shares of Johnson  Johnson Common Stock after the end of a three -year performance period. Whether any performance share units vest, and the amount that does vest, is tied to the completion of service periods that range from 6 months to 3 years and the achievement, over a three -year period, of three equally-weighted goals that directly align with or help drive long-term total shareholder return: operational sales, adjusted operational earnings per share, and relative total shareholder return. The number of shares actually earned at the end of the three -year period will vary, based only on actual performance, from 0% to 200% of the target number of performance share units granted . In the fourth quarter of 2017, the Company modified the restricted share units that are scheduled to vest between January 1, 2018 and March 15, 2018. This modification guaranteed a minimum aggregate value, below the market value of the total expected payout amount, for all awards expected to vest during this period. The amount that was committed was not material to the Companys overall financial position.  ##TABLE_START  ##TABLE_END A summary of the restricted share units and performance share units activity under the Plans as of December 30, 2018 is presented below: ##TABLE_START (Shares in Thousands)  Outstanding Restricted Share Units  Outstanding Performance Share Units Shares at December 31, 2017  20,161  2,625 Granted  6,074  1,142 Issued  (6,684 )  (1,151 ) Canceled/forfeited/adjusted  (1,091 )  (122 ) Shares at December 30, 2018  18,460  2,494 ##TABLE_ENDThe average fair value of the restricted share units granted was $119.67 , $107.69 and $92.45 in 2018 , 2017 and 2016 , respectively, using the fair market value at the date of grant. The fair value of restricted share units was discounted for dividends, which are not paid on the restricted share units during the vesting period. The fair value of restricted share units issued was $613.7 million , $596.5 million and $587.7 million in 2018 , 2017 and 2016 , respectively. The weighted average fair value of the performance share units granted was $120.64 , $114.13 and $105.30 in 2018 , 2017 and 2016 , calculated using the weighted average fair market value for each of the three component goals at the date of grant. The fair values for the sales and earnings per share goals of each performance share unit were estimated on the date of grant using the fair market value of the shares at the time of the award discounted for dividends, which are not paid on the performance share units during the vesting period. The fair value for the relative total shareholder return goal of each performance share unit was estimated on the date of grant using the Monte Carlo valuation model. The fair value of performance share units issued was $128.8 million , $132.5 million and $127.7 million in 2018 , 2017 and 2016 , respectively.  ##TABLE_START  ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START 18.

Business Combinations and Divestitures ##TABLE_END Certain businesses were acquired for $0.9 billion in cash and $0.1 billion of liabilities assumed during 2018. These acquisitions were accounted for using the acquisition method and, accordingly, results of operations have been included in the financial statements from their respective dates of acquisition. The 2018 acquisitions primarily included: Zarbees, Inc., a privately held company that is a leader in naturally-based consumer healthcare products; Medical Enterprises Distribution LLC, a privately held healthcare technology firm focused on surgical procedure innovation; BeneVir Biopharm, Inc. (BeneVir), a privately-held, biopharmaceutical company specializing in the development of oncolytic immunotherapies and Orthotaxy, a privately-held developer of software-enabled surgery technologies, including a differentiated robotic-assisted surgery solution. The excess of purchase price over the estimated fair value of tangible assets acquired amounted to $1.0 billion and has been assigned to identifiable intangible assets, with any residual recorded to goodwill. On October 23, 2018, the Company entered into an agreement to acquire Ci:z Holdings Co., Ltd., a Japanese company focused on the marketing, development and distribution of a broad range of dermocosmetic, cosmetic and skincare products for a total purchase price of approximately 230 billion , which equates to approximately $2.1 billion , using the exchange rate of 109.06 Japanese Yen to each U.S. Dollar on January 16, 2019. The acquisition was completed on January 17, 2019, through a series of transactions that included an all-cash tender offer to acquire the publicly held shares not already held by the Company for 5,900 per share. Upon completion of the tender offer and the related transactions, the Company acquired 89% of the outstanding shares. The Company plans to acquire the remaining shares that were not tendered in the tender offer through a share consolidation under Japanese law during the first half of 2019 and take appropriate actions to  delist from the Tokyo Stock Exchange. The acquisition will include the range of brands comprising DR.CI:LABO, LABO LABO and GENOMER line of skincare products. The Company expects to treat this transaction as a business combination and will include it in the Consumer segment. On February 13, 2019, the Company entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Auris Health, Inc. for approximately $3.4 billion in cash. Additional contingent payments of up to $2.35 billion , in the aggregate, may be payable upon reaching certain predetermined milestones. Auris Health is a privately held developer of robotic technologies, initially focused in lung cancer, with an FDA-cleared platform currently used in bronchoscopic diagnostic and therapeutic procedures. The closing is subject to antitrust clearance and other customary closing conditions. The transaction is expected to close by the end of the second quarter of 2019. The Company expects to treat this transaction as a business combination and will include it in the Medical Devices segment. During 2017 certain businesses were acquired for $35.2 billion in cash and $1.8 billion of liabilities assumed. These acquisitions were accounted for using the acquisition method and, accordingly, results of operations have been included in the financial statements from their respective dates of acquisition. The 2017 acquisitions primarily included: Actelion Ltd, an established leading franchise of differentiated, innovative products for pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH); Abbott Medical Optics (AMO), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Abbott Laboratories, which included ophthalmic products related to: cataract surgery, laser refractive surgery and consumer eye health; Neuravi Limited, a privately-held medical device company that develops and markets medical devices for neurointerventional therapy; TearScience Inc., a manufacturer of products dedicated to treating meibomian gland dysfunction; Sightbox, Inc., a privately-held company that developed a subscription vision care service that connects consumers with eye care professionals and a supply of contact lenses; Torax Medical, Inc., a privately-held medical device company that manufactures and markets the LINX Reflux Management System for the surgical treatment of gastroesophageal reflux disease and Megadyne Medical Products, Inc., a privately-held medical device company that develops, manufactures and markets electrosurgical tools. The excess of purchase price over the estimated fair value of tangible assets acquired amounted to $34.4 billion and has been assigned to identifiable intangible assets, with any residual recorded to goodwill. Of this amount, approximately $1.1 billion has been identified as the value of IPRD, primarily associated with the acquisition of Actelion Ltd. The value of the IPRD was calculated using cash flow projections discounted for the inherent risk in the projects. During 2017, the Company completed the acquisition of Actelion Ltd through an all cash tender offer in Switzerland for $280 per share, amounting to $29.6 billion , net of cash acquired. As part of the transaction, immediately prior to the completion of the acquisition, Actelion spun out its drug discovery operations and early-stage clinical development assets into a newly created Swiss biopharmaceutical company, Idorsia Ltd. The shares of Idorsia are listed on the SIX Swiss Exchange (SIX). In 2017 the Company held 9.9% of the shares of Idorsia and had rights to an additional 22.1% of Idorsia equity through a convertible loan with a principal amount of approximately $0.5 billion . As a result of Idorsia raising additional capital in July 2018, the Company currently holds 9.0% of the shares of Idorsia and has rights to an additional 20.8% of Idorsia equity through a convertible loan with a principal amount of approximately $0.5 billion . The convertible loan may be converted into Idorsia shares as follows: (i) up to an aggregate shareholding of 16% of Idorsia shares as a result of certain shareholders holding more than 20% of the issued Idorsia shares, and (ii) up to the balance of the remaining amount within 20 business days of the maturity date of the convertible loan, which has a 10 year term, or if Idorsia undergoes a change of control transaction. The investment in Idorsia was recorded as a cost method investment in Other assets in the Company's consolidated Balance Sheet. The Company also exercised the option acquired on ACT-132577, a product within Idorsia being developed for resistant hypertension currently in phase 2 of clinical development. The Company has also entered into an agreement to provide Idorsia  ##TABLE_START  ##TABLE_END with a Swiss franc denominated credit facility of approximately $250 million . As of December 30, 2018, Idorsia has not made any draw-downs under the credit facility. Actelion has entered into a transitional services agreement with Idorsia. Actelion has established a leading franchise of differentiated, innovative products for pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) that are highly complementary to the existing portfolio of the Company. The addition of Actelions specialty in-market medicines and late-stage products is consistent with the Company's efforts to grow in attractive and complementary therapeutic areas and serve patients with serious illnesses and significant unmet medical need. During the fiscal second quarter of 2018, the Company finalized the purchase price allocation to the individual assets acquired and liabilities assumed using the acquisition method. The following table presents the amounts recognized for assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of the acquisition date with adjustments made through the second quarter of 2018: ##TABLE_START (Dollars in Millions)  Cash  Cash equivalents Inventory (1) Accounts Receivable Other current assets Property, plant and equipment Goodwill 6,161 Intangible assets 25,010 Deferred Taxes Other non-current assets Total Assets Acquired 33,199   Current liabilities Deferred Taxes 1,776 Other non-current liabilities Total Liabilities Assumed 3,145   Net Assets Acquired 30,054 ##TABLE_END (1) Includes adjustment of $642 million to write-up the acquired inventory to its estimated fair value.  The adjustments made since the date of acquisition were $0.2 billion to the deferred taxes and $0.4 billion to the current liabilities with the offset to goodwill. The assets acquired are recorded in the Pharmaceutical segment. The acquisition of Actelion resulted in approximately $6.2 billion of goodwill. The goodwill is primarily attributable to synergies expected to arise from the acquisition. The goodwill is not expected to be deductible for tax purposes. The purchase price allocation to the identifiable intangible assets is as follows: ##TABLE_START (Dollars in Millions)   Intangible assets with definite lives:   Patents and trademarks*  $ 24,230 Total amortizable intangibles  24,230    In-process research and development  Total intangible assets  $ 25,010 ##TABLE_END*Includes $0.4 billion related to VALCHLOR  , one of the acquired products, which was divested in the fiscal second quarter of 2018. The patents and trademarks acquired are comprised of developed technology with a weighted average life of 9 years and was primarily based on the patent life of the marketed products. The intangible assets with definite lives were assigned asset lives ranging from 4 to 10 years . The in-process research and development intangible assets were valued for technology programs for unapproved products. The value of the IPRD was calculated using probability adjusted cash flow projections discounted for the risk inherent in such projects. The discount rate applied was 9% .  ##TABLE_START  ##TABLE_END The acquisition was accounted for using the acquisition method and, accordingly, the results of operations of Actelion were reported in the Company's financial statements beginning on June 16, 2017, the date of acquisition. For the year ended December 31, 2017, total sales and a net loss for Actelion from the date of acquisition were $1.4 billion and $1.4 billion , respectively. The following table provides pro forma results of operations for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017 and January 1, 2017, as if Actelion had been acquired as of January 4, 2016. The pro forma results include the effect of certain purchase accounting adjustments such as the estimated changes in depreciation and amortization expense on the acquired tangible and intangible assets. However, pro forma results do not include any anticipated cost savings or other effects of the planned integration of Actelion. Accordingly, such amounts are not necessarily indicative of the results if the acquisition had occurred on the dates indicated or which may occur in the future. ##TABLE_START  Unaudited Pro forma Consolidated Results (Dollars in Millions Except Per Share Data) 2016    Net Sales 77,681 74,339 Net Earnings 1,509 13,916 Diluted Net Earnings per Common Share 0.55 4.99 ##TABLE_ENDThe Company recorded Actelion acquisition related costs before tax of approximately $0.2 billion and $0.8 billion in 2018 and 2017, respectively, which was recorded in Other (income)/expense and Cost of products sold. During 2017, the Company acquired Abbott Medical Optics (AMO), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Abbott Laboratories, for $4.3 billion , net of cash acquired. The acquisition included ophthalmic products related to: cataract surgery, laser refractive surgery and consumer eye health. The net purchase price was primarily recorded as amortizable intangible assets for $2.3 billion and goodwill for $1.7 billion . The weighted average life of total amortizable intangibles, the majority being customer relationships, is approximately 14.4 years . The goodwill is primarily attributable to synergies expected to arise from the business acquisition and is not deductible for tax purposes. The intangible assets and goodwill amounts are based on the final purchase price allocation. The assets acquired were recorded in the Medical Devices segment. Certain businesses were acquired for $4.5 billion in cash and $0.1 billion of liabilities assumed during 2016. These acquisitions were accounted for using the acquisition method and, accordingly, results of operations have been included in the financial statements from their respective dates of acquisition. The 2016 acquisitions primarily included: Vogue International LLC, a privately-held company focused on the marketing, development and distribution of salon-influenced and nature inspired hair care and other personal products; NeuWave Medical, Inc., a privately-held medical device company that manufactures and markets minimally invasive soft tissue microwave ablation systems; NeoStrata Company, Inc., a global leader in dermocosmetics; and the global rights for the commercialization of RHINOCORT  allergy spray outside the United States. The excess of purchase price over the estimated fair value of tangible assets acquired amounted to $4.1 billion and has been assigned to identifiable intangible assets, with any residual recorded to goodwill. The net purchase price for Vogue International LLC of $3.3 billion was primarily recorded as amortizable intangible assets for $2.3 billion and goodwill for $1.1 billion . The weighted average life for the $2.3 billion of total amortizable intangibles is approximately 22 years . The trademark asset values were determined to have definite lives ranging from 10 to 22 years, with the majority being 22 years. The goodwill is primarily attributable to synergies expected to arise from the business acquisition and is expected to be deductible for tax purposes. The assets acquired were recorded in the Consumer segment. In 2012, the Company completed the acquisition of Synthes, Inc. for a purchase price of $20.2 billion in cash and stock. In connection with the acquisition of Synthes, Inc. the Company entered into two accelerated share repurchase (ASR) agreements. In 2013, the Company settled the remaining liabilities under the ASR agreements. While the Company believes that the transactions under each ASR agreement and a series of related internal transactions were consummated in a tax efficient manner in accordance with applicable law, it is possible that the Internal Revenue Service could assert one or more contrary positions to challenge the transactions from a tax perspective. If challenged, an amount up to the total purchase price for the Synthes shares could be treated as subject to applicable U.S. tax at approximately the statutory rate to the Company, plus interest. With the exception of the Actelion Ltd acquisition, supplemental pro forma information for 2018, 2017 and 2016 in accordance with U.S. GAAP standards related to business combinations, and goodwill and other intangible assets, is not provided, as the impact of the aforementioned acquisitions did not have a material effect on the Companys results of operations, cash flows or financial position. During 2018, the Company divested the LifeScan Inc business for approximately $2.1 billion and retained certain net liabilities. Other divestitures in 2018 included: NIZORAL  , RoC  and certain non-strategic Pharmaceutical products. In 2018, the pre-tax gains on the divestitures were approximately $1.2 billion . Additionally, in 2018, the Company accepted the binding  ##TABLE_START  ##TABLE_END offer from Fortive Corporation to acquire its Advanced Sterilization Products (ASP) business for approximately $2.7 billion , subject to customary adjustments. The transaction is expected to close in 2019. As of December 30, 2018, the assets held for sale on the Consolidated Balance Sheet were $0.2 billion of inventory, $0.1 billion of property, plant and equipment and $0.3 billion of goodwill. The Company will retain certain net receivables of approximately $0.1 billion associated with the ASP business. In 2018, the Company accepted a binding offer to form a strategic collaboration with Jabil Inc., one of the worlds leading manufacturing services providers for health care products and technology products. The Company is expanding a 12-year relationship with Jabil to produce a range of products within the Ethicon Endo-Surgery and DePuy Synthes businesses. This transaction includes the transfer of employees and manufacturing sites. As of December 30, 2018, the assets held for sale on the Consolidated Balance Sheet were $0.3 billion of inventory and $0.1 billion of property, plant and equipment, net. For additional details on the global supply chain restructuring see Note 22 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. During 2017, the Company divestitures primarily included: the Codman Neurosurgery business, to Integra LifeSciences Holdings Corporation and the divestiture of COMPEED  to HRA Pharma. In 2017, the pre-tax gains on the divestitures were approximately $1.3 billion . During 2016, the Company divestitures included: the controlled substance raw material and active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) business; certain anesthetic products in Europe; and certain non-strategic Consumer brands. In 2016, the pre-tax gains on the divestitures were approximately $0.6 billion . ##TABLE_START 21. Legal Proceedings ##TABLE_END Johnson  Johnson and certain of its subsidiaries are involved in various lawsuits and claims regarding product liability, intellectual property, commercial, supplier indemnification and other matters; governmental investigations; and other legal proceedings that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of their business. The Company records accruals for loss contingencies associated with these legal matters when it is probable that a liability will be incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. As of December 30, 2018 , the Company has determined that the liabilities associated with certain litigation matters are probable and can be reasonably estimated. The Company has accrued for these matters and will continue to monitor each related legal issue and adjust accruals as might be warranted based on new information and further developments in accordance with ASC 450-20-25. For these and other litigation and regulatory matters discussed below for which a loss is probable or reasonably possible, the Company is unable to estimate the possible loss or range of loss beyond the amounts already accrued. Amounts accrued for legal contingencies often result from a complex series of judgments about future events and uncertainties that rely heavily on estimates and assumptions. The ability to make such estimates and judgments can be affected by various factors, including whether damages sought in the proceedings are unsubstantiated or indeterminate; scientific and legal discovery has not commenced or is not complete; proceedings are in early stages; matters present legal uncertainties; there are significant facts in dispute; or there are numerous parties involved. In the Company's opinion, based on its examination of these matters, its experience to date and discussions with counsel, the ultimate outcome of legal proceedings, net of liabilities accrued in the Company's balance sheet, is not expected to have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial position. However, the resolution of, or increase in accruals for, one or more of these matters in any reporting period may have a material adverse effect on the Company's results of operations and cash flows for that period. PRODUCT LIABILITY Johnson  Johnson and certain of its subsidiaries are involved in numerous product liability claims and lawsuits involving multiple products. Claimants in these cases seek substantial compensatory and, where available, punitive damages. While the Company believes it has substantial defenses, it is not feasible to predict the ultimate outcome of litigation. The Company has established accruals for product liability claims and lawsuits in compliance with ASC 450-20 based on currently available information, which in some cases may be limited. The Company accrues an estimate of the legal defense costs needed to defend each matter when those costs are probable and can be reasonably estimated. For certain of these matters, the Company has accrued additional amounts such as estimated costs associated with settlements, damages and other losses. To the extent adverse verdicts have been rendered against the Company, the Company does not record an accrual until a loss is determined to be probable and can be reasonably estimated. Product liability accruals can represent projected product liability for thousands of claims around the world, each in different litigation environments and with different fact patterns. Changes to the accruals may be required in the future as additional information becomes available. The most significant of these cases include: the DePuy ASR XL Acetabular System and DePuy ASR Hip Resurfacing System; the PINNACLE  Acetabular Cup System; pelvic meshes; RISPERDAL  ; XARELTO  ; body powders containing talc, primarily JOHNSONS  Baby Powder; INVOKANA  ; and ETHICON PHYSIOMESH  Flexible Composite Mesh. As of December 30, 2018 , in the United States there were approximately 1,800 plaintiffs with direct claims in pending lawsuits  ##TABLE_START  ##TABLE_END regarding injuries allegedly due to the DePuy ASR XL Acetabular System and DePuy ASR Hip Resurfacing System; 10,500 with respect to the PINNACLE  Acetabular Cup System; 34,800 with respect to pelvic meshes; 13,400 with respect to RISPERDAL  ; 25,600 with respect to XARELTO  ; 13,000 with respect to body powders containing talc; 1,050 with respect to INVOKANA  ; and 2,100 with respect to ETHICON PHYSIOMESH  Flexible Composite Mesh. In August 2010, DePuy Orthopaedics, Inc. (DePuy) announced a worldwide voluntary recall of its ASR  XL Acetabular System and DePuy ASR  Hip Resurfacing System used in hip replacement surgery. Claims for personal injury have been made against DePuy and Johnson  Johnson. The number of pending lawsuits is expected to fluctuate as certain lawsuits are settled or dismissed and additional lawsuits are filed. Cases filed in federal courts in the United States have been organized as a multi-district litigation in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Ohio. Litigation has also been filed in countries outside of the United States, primarily in the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, Ireland, Germany and Italy. In November 2013, DePuy reached an agreement with a Court-appointed committee of lawyers representing ASR Hip System plaintiffs to establish a program to settle claims with eligible ASR Hip patients in the United States who had surgery to replace their ASR Hips, known as revision surgery, as of August 31, 2013. DePuy reached additional agreements in February 2015 and March 2017, which further extended the settlement program to include ASR Hip patients who had revision surgeries after August 31, 2013 and prior to February 15, 2017. This settlement program has resolved more than 10,000 claims, therefore bringing to resolution significant ASR Hip litigation activity in the United States. However, lawsuits in the United States remain, and the settlement program does not address litigation outside of the United States. In Australia, a class action settlement was reached that resolved the claims of the majority of ASR Hip patients in that country. In Canada, the Company has reached agreements to settle two pending class actions which have been approved by the Qubec Superior Court and the Supreme Court of British Columbia. The British Columbia order is currently the subject of an appeal.

Many of these matters involve challenges to the coverage and/or validity of the patents on various products and allegations that certain of the Companys products infringe the patents of third parties. Although these subsidiaries believe that they have substantial defenses to these challenges and allegations with respect to all significant patents, there can be no assurance as to the outcome of these matters. A loss in any of these cases could adversely affect the ability of these subsidiaries to sell their products, result in loss of sales due to loss of market exclusivity, require the payment of past damages and future royalties, and may result in a non-cash impairment charge for any associated intangible asset. The most significant of these matters are described below. Medical Devices In June 2009, Rembrandt Vision Technologies, L.P. (Rembrandt) filed a patent infringement lawsuit against Johnson  Johnson Vision Care, Inc. (JJVCI) in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Texas alleging that JJVCI's manufacture and sale of its ACUVUE  ADVANCE and ACUVUE OASYS  Hydrogel Contact Lenses infringed Rembrandts United States Patent No. 5,712,327 and seeking monetary relief. The case was transferred to the United States District Court for the Middle District of Florida, where a trial in May 2012 resulted in a verdict of non-infringement that was subsequently upheld on appeal. In July 2014, Rembrandt sought a new trial based on alleged new evidence, which the district court denied. In April 2016, the Court of Appeals overturned that ruling and remanded the case to the district court for a new trial. A new trial was held in August 2017, and the jury returned a verdict of non-infringement in favor of JJVCI. Rembrandt has appealed the verdict to the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit (CAFC). In February 2019, the CAFC affirmed the judgment in favor of JJVCI. In March 2013, Medinol Ltd. (Medinol) filed a patent infringement lawsuit against Cordis Corporation (Cordis) and Johnson  Johnson in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York alleging that Cordiss sales of the CYPHER  and CYPHER SELECT  stents made in the United States since 2005 willfully infringed four of Medinol's patents directed to the geometry of articulated stents. Medinol is seeking damages and attorneys fees. Although Johnson  Johnson has since sold Cordis, it has retained liability for this case. After trial in January 2014, the district court dismissed the case, finding Medinol unreasonably delayed bringing its claims (the laches defense). In September 2014, the district court denied a motion by Medinol to vacate the judgment and grant it a new trial. Medinol appealed the decision to the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. In March 2017, the United States Supreme Court held that the laches defense is not available in patent cases. In April 2018, the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit remanded the case back to the district court to reconsider Medinols motion for a new trial, and briefing in the district court was completed in June 2018. In November 2016, MedIdea, L.L.C.

Specifically, MedIdea alleges that the SOFCAM TM Contact feature of the ATTUNE  posterior stabilized knee products infringes the patents-in-suit. MedIdea is seeking monetary damages and injunctive relief. In June 2017, the case was transferred to the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts. A claim construction hearing was held in October 2018, and a claim construction order was issued in November 2018. In December 2018, MedIdea stipulated to non-infringement of the 132, 730 and 280 patents, based on the district courts claim construction and reserving its right to appeal that construction, leaving only the 426 patent at issue before the district court. In January 2019, the district court stayed the case pending a decision in the Inter Partes Review proceeding on the 426 patent (see below). In December 2017, DePuy Synthes Products, Inc. filed a Petition for Inter Partes Review with the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO), seeking to invalidate the two claims of the 426 patent asserted in the district court litigation, and in June 2018, the USPTO instituted review of those claims. A hearing trial is scheduled for March 2019, and a decision in the proceeding is due by June 2019.

(JBI), Genmab U.S. Inc. and Genmab A/S (collectively, Genmab) in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware. MorphoSys alleged that JBIs manufacture and sale of DARZALEX  (daratumumab) willfully infringed MorphoSys United States Patent Nos. 8,263,746, 9,200,061 and 9,785,590. MorphoSys sought money damages. JBI licenses patents and the commercial rights to DARZALEX  from Genmab. In January 2019, the district court granted summary judgment in JBI and Genmabs favor, invalidating the asserted claims of the patents-in-suit, and the parties filed a joint stipulation of dismissal of the action. In August 2016, Sandoz Ltd and Hexal AG (collectively, Sandoz) filed a lawsuit in the English High Court against G.D. Searle LLC, a Pfizer company (Searle) and Janssen Sciences Ireland UC (JSI) alleging that Searles supplementary protection certificate SPC/GB07/038 (SPC), which is exclusively licensed to JSI, is invalid and should be revoked. Janssen-Cilag Limited sells PREZISTA  (darunavir) in the United Kingdom pursuant to this license. In October 2016, Searle and JSI counterclaimed against Sandoz for threatened infringement of the SPC based on statements of its plans to launch generic darunavir in the United Kingdom. Sandoz admitted that its generic darunavir product would infringe the SPC if it is found valid. Searle and JSI are seeking an order enjoining Sandoz from marketing its generic darunavir before the expiration of the SPC. Following a trial in April 2017, the court entered a decision holding that the SPC is valid and granting a final injunction. Sandoz has appealed the courts decision and the injunction is stayed pending the appeal. In January 2018, the court referred the issue on appeal to the Court of Justice for the European Union (CJEU) and stayed the proceedings pending the CJEUs ruling on the issue. In April 2018, Acerta Pharma B.V., AstraZeneca UK Ltd and AstraZeneca Pharmaceuticals LP filed a patent infringement lawsuit in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware against Pharmacylics LLC and Abbvie Inc.

(collectively, Celltrion) filed an application with the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for approval to make and sell its own infliximab biosimilar. In March 2015, Janssen Biotech, Inc. (JBI) filed a lawsuit in the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts against Celltrion and Hospira Healthcare Corporation (Hospira), which has exclusive marketing rights for Celltrions infliximab biosimilar in the United States, seeking, among other things, a declaratory judgment that their biosimilar product infringes or potentially infringes several JBI patents, including United States Patent No. 6,284,471 relating to REMICADE  (infliximab) (the 471 patent) and United States Patent No. 7,598,083 (the 083 patent) directed to the cell culture media used to make Celltrions biosimilar. In August 2016, the district court granted both Celltrions and Hospiras motions for summary judgment of invalidity of the 471 patent. JBI appealed those decisions to the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. In January 2018, the Federal Circuit dismissed the appeal as moot based on its affirmance of a decision by the USPTOs Patent Trial and Appeal Board affirming invalidity of the 471 patent. In June 2016, JBI filed two additional patent infringement lawsuits asserting the 083 patent, one against Celltrion and Hospira in the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts and the other against HyClone Laboratories, Inc., the manufacturer of the cell culture media that Celltrion uses to make its biosimilar product, in the United States District Court for the District of Utah. On July 30, 2018 the district court granted Celltrions motion for summary judgment of non-infringement and entered an order dismissing the 083 lawsuit against Celltrion and Hospira. JBI appealed to the United States Court of  ##TABLE_START  ##TABLE_END Appeals for the Federal Circuit. The litigation against HyClone in Utah is stayed pending the outcome of the Massachusetts actions. The FDA approved the first infliximab biosimilar for sale in the United States in 2016, and a number of such products have been launched. Litigation Against Filers of Abbreviated New Drug Applications (ANDAs) The following summarizes lawsuits pending against generic companies that have filed Abbreviated New Drug Applications (ANDAs) with the FDA or undertaken similar regulatory processes outside of the United States, seeking to market generic forms of products sold by various subsidiaries of Johnson  Johnson prior to expiration of the applicable patents covering those products. These ANDAs typically include allegations of non-infringement and invalidity of the applicable patents. In the event the subsidiaries are not successful in an action, or the automatic statutory stay of the ANDAs expires before the United States District Court rulings are obtained, the third-party companies involved would have the ability, upon approval of the FDA, to introduce generic versions of their products to the market, resulting in the potential for substantial market share and revenue losses for the applicable products, and which may result in a non-cash impairment charge in any associated intangible asset. In addition, from time to time, subsidiaries may settle these types of actions and such settlements can involve the introduction of generic versions of the products at issue to the market prior to the expiration of the relevant patents. The Inter Partes Review (IPR) process with the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO), created under the 2011 America Invents Act, is also being used at times by generic companies in conjunction with ANDAs and lawsuits, to challenge the applicable patents. ZYTIGA   In July 2015, Janssen Biotech, Inc., Janssen Oncology, Inc. and Janssen Research  Development, LLC (collectively, Janssen) and BTG International Ltd.

(collectively, Qilu), who filed an ANDA seeking approval to market a generic version of ZYTIGA  before the expiration of the 438 patent. In December 2017, Janssen and BTG entered into a settlement agreement with Glenmark. In January 2018, Janssen dismissed its lawsuit against Sun after it withdrew its ANDA. In April 2018, Janssen and BTG entered into a settlement agreement with Apotex.  ##TABLE_START  ##TABLE_END In October 2018, the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey issued a ruling invalidating all asserted claims of the 438 patent. The court held that the patent claims would be infringed if the patent were valid. Janssen appealed the courts decision. In November 2018, the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit denied Janssens request for an injunction pending appeal. As a result, several generic versions of ZYTIGA  have entered the market. Janssen has appealed the decision of the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey, and the oral argument on the appeal is scheduled for March 2019.

GOVERNMENT PROCEEDINGS Like other companies in the pharmaceutical and medical devices industries, Johnson  Johnson and certain of its subsidiaries are subject to extensive regulation by national, state and local government agencies in the United States and other countries in which they operate. As a result, interaction with government agencies is ongoing. The most significant litigation brought by, and investigations conducted by, government agencies are listed below. It is possible that criminal charges and substantial fines and/or civil penalties or damages could result from government investigations or litigation. Average Wholesale Price (AWP) Litigation Johnson  Johnson and several of its pharmaceutical subsidiaries (the JJ AWP Defendants), along with numerous other pharmaceutical companies, were named as defendants in a series of lawsuits in state and federal courts involving allegations that the pricing and marketing of certain pharmaceutical products amounted to fraudulent and otherwise actionable conduct because, among other things, the companies allegedly reported an inflated Average Wholesale Price (AWP) for the drugs at issue. Payors alleged that they used those AWPs in calculating provider reimbursement levels. The plaintiffs in these cases included three classes of private persons or entities that paid for any portion of the purchase of the drugs at issue based on AWP, and state government entities that made Medicaid payments for the drugs at issue based on AWP. Many of these cases, both federal actions and state actions removed to federal court, were consolidated for pre-trial purposes in a multi-district litigation in the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts, where all claims against the JJ AWP Defendants were ultimately dismissed. The JJ AWP Defendants also prevailed in a case brought by the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. Other AWP cases have been resolved through court order or settlement. Two cases remain pending. In a case brought by Illinois, trial has been scheduled for March 2019. In New Jersey, a putative class action based upon AWP allegations is pending against Centocor, Inc. and Ortho Biotech Inc. (both now Janssen Biotech, Inc.), Johnson  Johnson and ALZA Corporation. Opioids Litigation Beginning in 2014 and continuing to the present, Johnson  Johnson and Janssen Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (JPI), along with other pharmaceutical companies, have been named in more than 1,600 lawsuits brought by certain state and local governments related to the marketing of opioids, including DURAGESIC  , NUCYNTA  and NUCYNTA  ER. To date, complaints against pharmaceutical companies, including Johnson  Johnson and JPI, have been filed in state court by the state Attorneys General in Arkansas, Florida, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, Ohio, Oklahoma and South Dakota. Complaints against the manufacturers also have been filed in state or federal court by city, county and local government agencies in the following states: Alabama; Arkansas; California; Connecticut; Florida; Georgia; Illinois; Kentucky; Louisiana; Maine; Maryland; Massachusetts; Mississippi; Missouri; Nevada; New Hampshire; New Jersey; New Mexico; New York; North Carolina; Ohio; Oklahoma; Oregon; Pennsylvania; Rhode Island; South Carolina; South Dakota; Tennessee; Texas; Utah; Virginia; Washington; West Virginia and Wisconsin. The Government of Puerto Rico filed suit in Superior Court of San Juan. In addition, the Province of British Columbia filed suit in Canada. These actions allege a variety of claims related to opioids marketing practices, including false advertising, unfair competition, public nuisance, consumer fraud violations, deceptive acts and practices, false claims and unjust enrichment. The suits generally seek penalties and/or injunctive and monetary relief and, in some of the suits, the plaintiffs are seeking joint and several liability among the defendants. These cases are in early stages of litigation. In October 2017, Johnson  Johnson and JPI were both served with a motion to consolidate 66 pending matters into a federal Multi District Litigation in the Southern District of Ohio. In December 2017, the MDL was approved in the Northern District of Ohio and there are over 1,400 cases that have been transferred to the MDL. Johnson  Johnson, JPI and other pharmaceutical companies have also received subpoenas or requests for information related to opioids marketing practices from the following state Attorneys General: Alaska, Indiana, Montana, New Hampshire, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas and Washington. In September 2017, Johnson  Johnson and JPI were contacted by the Texas and Colorado Attorney Generals Offices on behalf of approximately 38 states regarding a multi-state Attorney General investigation. The multi-state coalition served Johnson  Johnson and JPI with subpoenas as part of the investigation. Johnson  Johnson and JPI have also received requests for information from the ranking minority member of the United States Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs regarding the sales, marketing, and educational strategies related to the promotion of opioids use. Other  ##TABLE_START  ##TABLE_END In August 2012, DePuy Orthopaedics, Inc., DePuy, Inc. (now known as DePuy Synthes, Inc.), and Johnson  Johnson Services, Inc. (collectively DePuy) received an informal request from the United States Attorney's Office for the District of Massachusetts and the Civil Division of the United States Department of Justice (the United States) for the production of materials relating to the DePuy ASR XL Hip device. In July 2014, the United States notified the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts that it had declined to intervene in a qui tam case filed pursuant to the False Claims Act against the companies. In February 2016, the district court granted the companies motion to dismiss with prejudice, unsealed the qui tam complaint, and denied the qui tam relators request for leave to file a further amended complaint. The qui tam relators appealed the case to the United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit. In July 2017, the First Circuit affirmed the district courts dismissal in part, reversed in part, and affirmed the decision to deny the relators request to file a third amended complaint. The relators remaining claims are now pending before the district court, and fact discovery is currently scheduled to close in September 2019. Additionally, DePuy filed a petition for certiorari with the United States Supreme Court, seeking review of the First Circuits decision. The Supreme Court denied the petition in April 2018. Since October 2013, a group of State Attorneys General have issued Civil Investigative Demands relating to the development, sales and marketing of several of DePuy Orthopaedics, Inc.'s hip products. In July 2014, the Oregon Department of Justice, which was investigating these matters independently of the other states, announced a settlement of its ASR XL Hip device investigation  with the State of Oregon.

In October 2012, Johnson  Johnson was contacted by the California Attorney General's office regarding a multi-state Attorney General investigation of the marketing of surgical mesh products for hernia and urogynecological purposes by Johnson  Johnson's subsidiary, Ethicon, Inc. (Ethicon). Johnson  Johnson and Ethicon have since entered into a series of tolling agreements with the 47 states and the District of Columbia participating in the multi-state investigation and have responded to Civil Investigative Demands served by certain of the participating states. The states are seeking monetary and injunctive relief. In May 2016, California and Washington filed civil complaints against Johnson  Johnson, Ethicon and Ethicon US, LLC alleging violations of their consumer protection statutes. Similar complaints were filed against the companies by Kentucky in August 2016 and by Mississippi in October 2017. Johnson  Johnson and Ethicon have entered into a new tolling agreement with the remaining 43 states and the District of Columbia. In December 2012, Therakos, Inc. (Therakos), formerly a subsidiary of Johnson  Johnson and part of the Ortho-Clinical Diagnostics, Inc.

The United States Attorney's Office requested that OCD and Johnson  Johnson preserve documents that could relate to the investigation. Therakos was subsequently acquired by an affiliate of Gores Capital Partners III, L.P. in January 2013, and OCD was divested in June 2014. Following the divestiture of OCD, Johnson  Johnson retains OCDs portion of any liability that may result from the investigation for activity that occurred prior to the sale of Therakos.

Trial is stayed pending interlocutory appeal of a denial of JJCI's motion for summary judgment. In March 2016, Janssen Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (JPI) received a Civil Investigative Demand from the United States Attorneys Office for the Southern District of New York related to JPIs contractual relationships with pharmacy benefit managers over the period from January 1, 2006 to the present with regard to certain of JPI's pharmaceutical products.

At this time, the federal and state governments have declined to intervene and the lawsuit, which is related to the Civil Investigative Demand, is being prosecuted by a former company employee. The United States  ##TABLE_START  ##TABLE_END District Court for the Central District of California dismissed the claim in April 2018. In May 2018, the relator filed a notice of appeal to the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit.

The authorities appear to be investigating allegations of possible anti-competitive behavior and possible improper payments in the medical device industry. The United States Department of Justice and the United States Securities and Exchange Commission have made additional preliminary inquiries about the inspection in Brazil, and Johnson  Johnson do Brasil Indstria e Comrcio de Produtos para Sade Ltda.  is cooperating with those requests. From time to time, the Company has received requests from a variety of United States Congressional Committees to produce information relevant to ongoing congressional inquiries.

These costs are associated with network optimizations, exit costs and accelerated depreciation and amortization.  ##TABLE_START  ##TABLE_END The following table summarizes the severance charges and the associated spending under these initiatives through the fiscal year ended 2018:  ##TABLE_START (Dollars in Millions) Severance Asset Write-offs Other** Total Reserve balance, January 3, 2016 $  501      2016 activity (104 )  (16 ) (120 )      Reserve balance, January 1, 2017  381      2017 activity (151 )  (114 )      Reserve balance, December 31, 2017  267      Current year activity:     Charges  568 Cash payments (35 )  (558 ) (593 ) Settled non cash  (132 )  (132 ) Reserve balance, December 30, 2018* $  242      ##TABLE_END *Cash outlays for severance are expected to be substantially paid out over the next 2 years in accordance with the Company's plans and local laws. **Other includes project expense such as salaries for employees supporting the initiative and consulting expenses. Although the Medical Devices restructuring program was completed in 2018, the Company expects that severance charges will continue beyond that date. The Company continuously reevaluates its severance reserves related to restructuring and the timing of payments has extended due to the planned release of associates regarding several longer-term projects. The Company believes that the existing severance reserves are sufficient to cover the Global Supply Chain plans given the period over which the actions will take place. The Company will continue to assess and make adjustments as necessary if additional amounts become probable and estimable. Approximately 2,375 individuals received separation payments since these restructuring announcements.  ##TABLE_START  ##TABLE_END Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm To the  Board of Directors and Shareholders of Johnson  Johnson Opinions on the Financial Statements and Internal Control over Financial Reporting We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Johnson  Johnson and its subsidiaries (the Company) as of December 30, 2018  and December 31, 2017,  and the related consolidated statements of earnings, of comprehensive income, of equity, and of cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 30, 2018 including the related notes (collectively referred to as the consolidated financial statements).  We also have audited the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 30, 2018, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework  (2013)  issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 30, 2018  and December 31, 2017 , and the results of its  operations and its  cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 30, 2018  in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 30, 2018, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework  (2013)  issued by the COSO. Basis for Opinions The Company's management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Managements Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express opinions on the Companys consolidated financial statements and on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions. Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting A companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.  ##TABLE_START  ##TABLE_END Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. /s/PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP Florham Park, New Jersey February 20, 2019 We have served as the Companys auditor since at least 1920. We have not been able to determine the specific year we began serving as auditor of the Company.   ##TABLE_START  ##TABLE_END Managements Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting Under Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, management is required to assess the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting as of the end of each fiscal year and report, based on that assessment, whether the Companys internal control over financial reporting is effective. Management of the Company is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. The Companys internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance as to the reliability of the Companys financial reporting and the preparation of external financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Internal controls over financial reporting, no matter how well designed, have inherent limitations. Therefore, internal control over financial reporting determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and may not prevent or detect all misstatements. Moreover, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. The Companys management has assessed the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting as of December 30, 2018. In making this assessment, the Company used the criteria established by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013). These criteria are in the areas of control environment, risk assessment, control activities, information and communication, and monitoring. The Companys assessment included extensive documenting, evaluating and testing the design and operating effectiveness of its internal controls over financial reporting. Based on the Companys processes and assessment, as described above, management has concluded that, as of December 30, 2018, the Companys internal control over financial reporting was effective. The effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting as of December 30, 2018 has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report, which appears herein. ##TABLE_START /s/ Alex Gorsky  /s/ Joseph J.
