Business Overview Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc., a Delaware corporation (Walgreens Boots Alliance), is the first global, pharmacy-led health and wellbeing enterprise with net sales of $103.4 billion in the fiscal year ended August 31, 2015. Our purpose is to help people across the world lead healthier and happier lives.Together with our equity method investments:##TABLE_START  we are a global leader in pharmacy-led health and wellbeing retail, with more than 13,100 stores in 11 countries; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  we are one of the largest global pharmaceutical wholesale and distribution networks, with more than 350 distribution centers delivering to more than 200,000 pharmacies, doctors, health centers and hospitals each year in 19 countries; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  we are one of the worlds largest purchasers of prescription drugs and other health and wellbeing products; and ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  we employ more than 370,000 employees, of which more than 100,000 are healthcare providers such as pharmacists, pharmacy technicians, nurse practitioners and other health related professionals. ##TABLE_END Our portfolio of retail and business global brands includes Walgreens, Duane Reade, Boots and Alliance Healthcare, as well as increasingly global health and beauty product brands, including No7, Botanics, Liz Earle and Soap  Glory. Our global brands portfolio is enhanced by our in-house new product research and development and manufacturing capabilities. We seek to further drive innovative ways to address global health and wellness challenges. We believe we are well positioned to expand customer offerings in existing markets and become a health and wellbeing partner of choice in emerging markets.Walgreens Boots Alliance was incorporated in Delaware in 2014 and, as described below, is the successor of Walgreen Co., an Illinois corporation (Walgreens), which was formed in 1909 as a successor to a business founded in 1901. Our principal executive offices are located at 108 Wilmot Road, Deerfield, Illinois 60015. Our common stock trades on the NASDAQ Stock Market under the symbol WBA.Recent Transactions On August 2, 2012, Walgreens acquired a 45% equity interest in Alliance Boots GmbH (Alliance Boots) along with a call option to acquire the remaining 55% equity interest in Alliance Boots (the First Step Transaction) in exchange for $4.025 billion in cash and approximately 83.4 million shares of Walgreens common stock.On December 31, 2014, Walgreens Boots Alliance became the successor of Walgreens pursuant to a merger to effect a reorganization of Walgreens into a holding company structure (the Reorganization), with Walgreens Boots Alliance becoming the parent holding company. Pursuant to the Reorganization, Walgreens became a wholly-owned subsidiary of Walgreens Boots Alliance, which was formed for the purposes of the Reorganization, and each issued and outstanding share of Walgreens common stock was converted into one share of Walgreens Boots Alliance common stock. Also on December 31, 2014, following the completion of the Reorganization, Walgreens Boots Alliance completed the acquisition pursuant to the call option of the remaining 55% of Alliance Boots that Walgreens did not previously own (the Second Step Transaction) in exchange for 3.133 billion ($4.874 billion) in cash and 144.3 million shares of Walgreens Boots Alliance common stock.Prior to the completion of the Second Step Transaction, we accounted for our 45% investment in Alliance Boots using the equity method of accounting. Investments accounted for under the equity method are recorded initially at cost and subsequently adjusted for our share of the net income or loss and cash contributions and distributions to or from these entities. Net income reported by Alliance Boots during this period was translated from British Pounds Sterling at the average rate for the period. Upon completion of the Second Step Transaction, Alliance Boots became a consolidated subsidiary and ceased being accounted for under the equity method. For financial reporting and accounting purposes, Walgreens Boots Alliance was the acquirer of Alliance Boots. The consolidated financial statements (and other data, such as prescriptions filled) reflect the results of operations and financial position of Walgreens and its subsidiaries for periods prior to December 31, 2014 and of Walgreens Boots Alliance and its subsidiaries for periods as of and after the closing of the Reorganization on December 31, 2014. For additional information, see Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (MDA) in Part II, Item 7 below and Note 6, Equity Method Investments, to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 below.On March 19, 2013, Walgreens, Alliance Boots and AmerisourceBergen Corporation (AmerisourceBergen) announced various agreements and arrangements, including a ten-year pharmaceutical distribution agreement between Walgreens and AmerisourceBergen pursuant to which branded and generic pharmaceutical products are sourced from AmerisourceBergen in the U.S.; an agreement which provides AmerisourceBergen the ability to access generics and related pharmaceutical products through Walgreens Boots Alliance Development GmbH (WBAD), a global sourcing enterprise formed by Walgreens and Alliance Boots; and agreements and arrangements pursuant to which we have the right, but not the obligation, to purchase a minority equity position in AmerisourceBergen and gain associated representation on AmerisourceBergens board of directors in certain circumstances. Please refer to our Form 8-K filed on March 20, 2013 for more detailed information regarding these agreements and arrangements. As of August 31, 2015, we owned approximately 5.2% of the outstanding common shares of AmerisourceBergen and had designated one member of AmerisourceBergens board of directors. In addition, we have undertaken a number of additional acquisitions, divestitures, and strategic initiatives in recent years designed to grow our businesses and enhance our competitive position. These initiatives are described in MDA in Part II, Item 7 below and Note 4, Restructuring, Note 6, Equity Method Investments and Note 8, Acquisitions to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 below.Pending Transaction On October 27, 2015, the Company entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger with Rite Aid Corporation (\"Rite Aid'') and Victoria Merger Sub, Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company (the \"Merger Agreement\"), pursuant to which the Company agreed, subject to the terms and conditions thereof, to acquire Rite Aid, a drugstore chain in the United States with 4,561 stores in 31 states and the District of Columbia as of August 29, 2015. The transaction is expected to close in the second half of calendar 2016, subject to Rite Aid stockholder approval, regulatory approvals and other customary closing conditions. For more information, see \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\" in Part II, Item 7 below and Note 21, Subsequent Event, to our Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 below.Industry Overview The global retail pharmacy and pharmaceutical wholesale industries are highly competitive and have been experiencing consolidation in recent years. Prescription drugs play a significant role in healthcare and constitute a first line of treatment for many medical conditions. We believe the long-term outlook for prescription drug utilization is strong due, in part, to aging populations, increases in life expectancy, increases in the availability and utilization of generic drugs, the continued development of innovative drugs that improve quality of life and control healthcare costs, and increases in the number of persons with insurance coverage for prescription drugs, including, in the United States, the expansion of healthcare insurance coverage under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (the ACA) and baby boomers increasingly becoming eligible for the federally funded Medicare Part D prescription program. Wholesalers in the pharmaceutical distribution business function as a vital link between drug manufacturers and pharmacies and healthcare providers in supplying pharmaceuticals to patients. The global retail pharmacy industry relies significantly on private and governmental third party payers. Many private organizations throughout the healthcare industry, including pharmacy benefit management (PBM) companies and health insurance companies, have consolidated in recent years to create larger healthcare enterprises with greater bargaining power. Third party payers, including the Medicare Part D plans and the state-sponsored Medicaid and related managed care Medicaid agencies in the United States, can change eligibility requirements or reduce certain reimbursement rates. In addition, in many European countries, the government provides or subsidizes healthcare to consumers and regulates pharmaceutical prices, patient eligibility, and reimbursement levels to control costs for the government-sponsored healthcare system. Changes in law or regulation also can impact reimbursement rates and terms. For example, the ACA seeks to reduce federal spending by altering the Medicaid reimbursement formula (AMP) for multi-source drugs, and when implemented, is expected to reduce Medicaid reimbursements. State Medicaid programs are also expected to continue to seek reductions in reimbursements independent of AMP. When third party payers or governmental authorities take actions that restrict eligibility or reduce prices or reimbursement rates, sales and margins in the retail pharmacy industry could be reduced, which would adversely affect industry profitability. In some cases, these possible adverse effects may be partially or entirely offset by controlling inventory costs and other expenses, dispensing more higher margin generics, finding new revenue streams through pharmacy services or other offerings and/or dispensing a greater volume of prescriptions.Generic prescription drugs have continued to help lower overall costs for customers and third party payers. We expect the utilization of generic pharmaceuticals to continue to increase. In general, in the United States, generic versions of drugs generate lower total sales dollars per prescription, but higher gross profit margins and gross profit dollars, as compared with patent-protected brand name drugs. The positive impact on retail pharmacy gross profit margins and gross profit dollars can be significant in the first several months after a generic version of a drug is first allowed to compete with the branded version, which is generally referred to as a generic conversion. In any given year, the number of major brand name drugs that undergo a conversion from branded to generic status can vary and the timing of generic conversions can be difficult to predict, which can have a significant impact on retail pharmacy sales, gross profit margins and gross profit dollars. We expect that market demand, government regulation, third-party reimbursement policies, government contracting requirements and other pressures will continue to cause the industries in which we compete to evolve. Pharmacists are on the frontlines of the healthcare delivery system, and we believe rising healthcare costs and the limited supply of primary care physicians present new opportunities for pharmacists and retail pharmacies to play an even greater role in driving positive outcomes for patients and payers through expanded service offerings such as immunizations and other preventive care, healthcare clinics, pharmacist-led medication therapy management and chronic condition management.- 2 -Segments Prior to December 31, 2014, Walgreens operations were reported within one reportable segment. Following the completion of the Reorganization and the Second Step Transaction, we organized our operations to reflect our new structure. Our operations are now organized into three divisions, which are also our reportable segments:##TABLE_START  Retail Pharmacy USA; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  Retail Pharmacy International; and ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  Pharmaceutical Wholesale. ##TABLE_END For fiscal 2015, our segment total sales were: Retail Pharmacy USA, $81.0 billion; Retail Pharmacy International, $8.8 billion; and Pharmaceutical Wholesale, $15.3 billion. Due to the timing of completion of the Second Step Transaction, Retail Pharmacy International and Pharmaceutical Wholesale total sales reflect operations for the last eight months of our fiscal year. Additional information relating to our segments is included in MDA in Part II, Item 7 below and in Note 19, Segment Reporting to our Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 below, which information is incorporated herein by reference.Retail Pharmacy USAOur Retail Pharmacy USA division has pharmacy-led health and beauty retail businesses in 50 states, the District of Colombia, Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands, each focused on helping people feel healthy and happy. We operated 8,173 retail stores in the division as of August 31, 2015. Our principal retail pharmacy brands in the division are Walgreens and Duane Reade. We are a market leader in the United States and, as of August 31, 2015, approximately 76% of the population of the United States lived within five miles of a Walgreens or Duane Reade retail pharmacy.We provide customers with convenient, omni-channel access to consumer goods and services, including own branded general merchandise such as NICE!, DeLish TM and Well at Walgreens, as well as pharmacy and health and wellness services in communities across America. Our websites receive an average of approximately 68 million visits per month. Integrated with our e-commerce platform, the Walgreens mobile application allows customers to refill prescriptions through scan technology, receive text messages alerting when a refill is due and other retail functionality, such as photo and shopping features.Our services help improve health outcomes for patients and manage costs for payers including employers, managed care organizations, health systems, PBM companies and the public sector. We utilize our retail network as a channel to provide health and wellness services to our customers and patients, as illustrated by our ability to play a significant role in providing flu vaccines and other immunizations. We also provide specialty pharmacy services and manage in-store clinics branded as Healthcare Clinic, with more than 400 locations throughout the United States as of August 31, 2015. We have more than 74,000 healthcare service providers, including pharmacists, pharmacy technicians, nurse practitioners and other health related professionals.The components of the divisions sales are Pharmacy (the sale of prescription drugs and provision of pharmacy-related services) and Retail (the sale of healthcare and retail products including non-prescription drugs, beauty, toiletries and general merchandise). The divisions sales are subject to the influence of seasonality, particularly the winter holiday and cough, cold and flu seasons. This seasonality also can affect the divisions proportion of sales between Retail and Pharmacy during certain periods. The components of the divisions fiscal year total sales were as follows:##TABLE_START   Fiscal 2015  Fiscal 2014  Fiscal 2013 Pharmacy  66%  64%  63%Retail  34%  36%  37%Total  100%  100%  100%##TABLE_END We filled approximately 723 million prescriptions (including immunizations) in the division in fiscal 2015. Adjusted to 30-day equivalents, prescriptions filled were 894 million in fiscal 2015. Sales where reimbursement is received from managed care organizations, governmental agencies, PBM companies and private insurance were 96.8% of the divisions fiscal 2015 pharmacy sales.We fill prescriptions for many state Medicaid public assistance programs. Revenues from all such Medicaid plans were approximately 4.5% of the divisions fiscal 2015 total sales. Revenues from Medicare Part D plans were approximately 15.9% of the divisions fiscal 2015 total sales. - 3 -Our U.S. loyalty program, Balance Rewards, is designed to reward our most valuable customers and encourage shopping in stores and online. Balance Rewards members receive special pricing on select products and earn everyday rewards points for purchasing most merchandise that can be instantly redeemed at our stores or through walgreens.com. As of August 31, 2015, the number of active Balance Rewards members totaled approximately 85 million. For this purpose, we define an active member as someone who has used their card in the last six months.AmerisourceBergen began to supply and distribute all branded pharmaceutical products that we historically sourced from distributors and suppliers to the divisions retail stores as of September 1, 2013, and during calendar 2014, it began to supply and distribute increasingly significant levels of generic pharmaceutical products that, in the past, we self-distributed. This transition to AmerisourceBergen was substantially complete as of August 31, 2014. We purchase our non-pharmaceutical merchandise from numerous manufacturers and wholesalers.Our sales, gross profit margin and gross profit dollars are impacted by, among other things, both the percentage of prescriptions that we fill that are generic and the rate at which new generic drugs are introduced to the market. Because any number of factors outside of our control can affect timing for a generic conversion, we face substantial uncertainty in predicting when such conversions will occur and what effect they will have on particular future periods.The current environment of our pharmacy business also includes ongoing generic inflation, reimbursement pressure, and a shift in pharmacy mix towards 90-day at retail (one prescription that is the equivalent of three 30-day prescriptions). In fiscal 2014 and fiscal 2015, we experienced cost increases on a subset of generic drugs that historically experienced deflation, some of which were significant. We expect this generic inflation to continue into fiscal 2016.We continuously face reimbursement pressure from PBM companies, health maintenance organizations, managed care organizations and other commercial third party payers; our agreements with these payers are regularly subject to expiration, termination or renegotiation. In addition, plan changes with rate adjustments often occur in January and our reimbursement arrangements may provide for rate adjustments at prescribed intervals during their term. We experienced lower reimbursement rates in fiscal 2015 as compared to the same period in the prior year. Further, we accepted lower Medicare Part D reimbursement rates in calendar 2015 compared to calendar 2014 in order to secure preferred relationships with Medicare Part D plans serving senior patients with significant pharmacy needs. Our 90-day at retail prescription drug offering is typically at a lower margin than comparable 30-day prescriptions, but provides us with the opportunity to increase business with patients with chronic prescription needs while offering increased convenience, helping facilitate improved prescription adherence and resulting in a lower cost to fill the 90-day prescription. We expect that these factors will continue to have an adverse impact on gross profit dollar growth in our pharmacy business in fiscal 2016.Retail Pharmacy InternationalOur Retail Pharmacy International division (excluding equity method investments) has pharmacy-led health and beauty retail businesses in eight countries, each focused on helping people look and feel their best. We operated 4,582 retail stores in this division as of August 31, 2015 (see Properties in Part I, Item 2 below for information regarding geographic coverage), and have grown our online presence significantly in recent years. Our principal retail pharmacy brands are Boots in the United Kingdom, Thailand, Norway, the Republic of Ireland and The Netherlands, and Benavides in Mexico and Ahumada in Chile. In Europe, we are a market leader and our retail stores are conveniently located and our pharmacists are well placed to provide a significant role in the provision of healthcare services, working closely with other primary healthcare providers in the communities we serve.The Boots omni-channel offering is differentiated from that of competitors due to the product brands we own, such as No7, Boots Pharmaceuticals, Botanics, Liz Earle, Soap  Glory, and only at Boots exclusive products, together with our long established reputation for trust and customer care. Our brands portfolio is enhanced by our in-house product research and development and manufacturing capabilities.Our retail store networks are typically complemented by on-line platforms. In the United Kingdom, our transactional website, boots.com, and our consumer health and wellness portal, BootsWebMD.com, continued to be two of the most visited health websites, receiving on average approximately 19 million and 11 million visits monthly. Through the boots.com website and integrated mobile application, our order and collect service allows customers to order from a range of over 30,000 products by 8:00 p.m. and collect by noon the following day from approximately 90% of the United Kingdoms retail stores as of August 31, 2015.The Boots Advantage Card loyalty program, where customers earn points on purchases for redemption at a later date, continues to be a key element of the Boots offering. As of August 31, 2015, the number of active Boots Advantage Card members totaled approximately 16 million. For this purpose, we define an active member as someone who has used their card in the last six months.- 4 -In addition, Boots in the United Kingdom is one of the leaders in the optical market with 637 practices, of which 177 operated on a franchise basis as of August 31, 2015. Approximately 30% of these optical practices are located in Boots stores with the balance being standalone optical practices.The components of the divisions sales are Pharmacy (typically the sale of prescription drugs and provision of pharmacy-related services, subject to variation in particular jurisdictions depending upon regulatory and other factors) and Retail (primarily the sale of health and beauty products including beauty, toiletries and lifestyle merchandising, non-prescription drugs and, in the United Kingdom, the provision of optical services).The divisions sales are subject to the influence of seasonality, with the second fiscal quarter typically the strongest as a result of the winter holiday period. This seasonality affects the divisions proportion of sales between Retail and Pharmacy during certain periods. Subsequent to the Second Step Transaction, for the months of January through August 2015, Pharmacy and Retail sales represented 37% and 63% of total division sales, respectively.The divisions Retail sales, gross profit margin and gross profit dollars are impacted by, among other things, the highly competitive nature of the health and beauty category, specifically our and our competitors pricing actions, promotional offers and events and our customers desire for value and convenience.The divisions Pharmacy sales, gross margin and gross profit dollars are impacted by governmental agencies and other third party payers seeking to minimize increases in the costs of healthcare, including pharmaceutical drug reimbursement rates. In the United Kingdom, our largest market for Pharmacy sales in the division, the amount of government funding available for pharmacy services is reviewed and agreed with the pharmacy industry on an annual basis, has been broadly unchanged for the last two years.In addition, performance as measured in U.S. dollars is impacted by the exchange rates used to translate these amounts into U.S. dollars, the exchange rate of British Pounds Sterling being the most significant.Pharmaceutical WholesaleOur Pharmaceutical Wholesale division (excluding equity method investments), which mainly operates under the Alliance Healthcare brand, supplies medicines, other healthcare products and related services to more than 140,000 pharmacies, doctors, health centers and hospitals each year from 302 distribution centers in 12 countries, primarily in Europe, as of August 31, 2015.The distribution of prescription medicines to pharmacists comprises the vast majority of the divisions sales. Our wholesale businesses seek to provide high core service levels to pharmacists in terms of frequency of delivery, product availability, delivery accuracy, timeliness and reliability at competitive prices. We also offer customers innovative added-value services to help pharmacists develop their own businesses. This includes membership of Alphega Pharmacy, our pan-European network for independent pharmacies, which, as of August 31, 2015, had over 6,500 members.In addition to the wholesale of medicines and other healthcare products, our businesses provide services to pharmaceutical manufacturers who are increasingly seeking to gain greater control over their product distribution, while at the same time outsourcing non-core activities. These services include pre-wholesale and contract logistics (mainly under the Alloga brand), direct deliveries to pharmacies, and innovative and specialized healthcare services, covering clinical homecare, medicine support, dispensing services, medicine preparation and clinical trial support (mainly under the Alcura brand).Combined with local engagement, scale is important in pharmaceutical wholesaling. We are one of the largest pharmaceutical wholesalers and distributors in Europe, and we rank as one of the top three in market share in many of the individual countries in which we operate.Our sales, gross profit margin and gross profit dollars are impacted by, among other things, government actions, which typically seek to reduce the growth in prescription drug consumption, reduce reimbursement rates and increase generic drug utilization. A greater proportion of generic drugs, whether as a result of government actions, generic conversions or other factors, typically has an adverse effect on our revenues. However, in the wholesale division we typically earn equal or better gross margins on generic drugs than on branded drugs, although there are exceptions. - 5 -Changes in manufacturers product distribution business models also can impact the divisions sales and gross margin. For example, when pharmaceutical drug manufacturers introduce fee-for-service contracts, it reduces our sales even if we are successful in winning these contracts, as we only recognize sales in the amount of the fees charged. Other manufacturer services, including our pre-wholesale and contract logistics operations are typically on a fee-for-service basis.In addition, performance as measured in U.S. dollars is impacted by the exchange rates used to translate these amounts into U.S. dollars, the exchange rate of British Pounds Sterling and the Euro being the most significant. The divisions sales are subject to less seasonality than our other divisions.Intellectual property and licenses We market products and services under various trademarks, trade dress and trade names and rely on a combination of patent, copyright, trademark, service mark, and trade secret laws, as well as contractual restrictions to establish and protect our proprietary rights. We own numerous domain names, hold numerous patents, have registered numerous trademarks, and have filed applications for the registration of a number of our other trademarks and service marks in various jurisdictions. We hold assorted business licenses (such as pharmacy, occupational, liquor and cigarette) having various lives within multiple legal jurisdictions, which are necessary for the normal operation of our business.Seasonal variations in business Our business is affected by a number of factors including, among others, our sales performance during holiday periods (including particularly the winter holiday season) and during the cough, cold and flu season (the timing and severity of which is difficult to predict), significant weather conditions, the timing of our own or competitor discount programs and pricing actions, and the timing of changes in levels of reimbursement from governmental agencies and other third party payers. See Summary of Quarterly Results (Unaudited) in the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 below.Sources and availability of raw materials Inventories are purchased from numerous domestic and foreign suppliers. We do not believe that the loss of any one supplier or group of suppliers under common control would have a material adverse effect on our business or that of any of our divisions.Working capital practices Effective inventory management is important to our operations. We use various inventory management techniques, including demand forecasting and planning and various forms of replenishment management. Our working capital needs typically are greater in the months leading up to the winter holiday season. We generally finance our inventory and expansion needs with internally generated funds and short-term borrowings. For additional information, see the Liquidity and Capital Resources section in MDA in Part II, Item 7 below.Customers We sell to numerous retail and wholesale customers. No customer or payer accounted for ten percent or more of our consolidated net sales in fiscal 2015. One third party payer, OptumRx, accounted for approximately 12.3% of our Retail Pharmacy USA divisions fiscal 2015 total sales. One customer in our Retail Pharmacy International division, NHS England, accounted for approximately 20.0% of the divisions fiscal 2015 total sales.Regulation In the countries in which we do business, we are subject to national, state and local laws, regulations, and administrative practices concerning retail and wholesale pharmacy operations, including regulations relating to our participation in Medicare, Medicaid and other publicly financed health benefit plans; regulations prohibiting kickbacks, beneficiary inducement and the submission of false claims; the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA); the ACA; licensure and registration requirements concerning the operation of pharmacies and the practice of pharmacy; and regulations of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, the U.S. Federal Trade Commission, the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration and the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission, as well as regulations promulgated by comparable foreign, state and local governmental authorities concerning the operation of our businesses. We are also subject to laws and regulations relating to licensing, tax, foreign trade, intellectual property, privacy and data protection, currency, political and other business restrictions.We are also governed by national, state and local laws of general applicability in the countries in which we do business, including laws regulating matters of working conditions, health and safety and equal employment opportunity. In connection with the operation of our businesses, we are subject to laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment and health and safety matters, including those governing exposure to, and the management and disposal of, hazardous substances. Environmental protection requirements did not have a material effect on our results of operations or capital expenditures in fiscal 2015.- 6 -Competitive conditions The industries in which we operate are highly competitive. As a leader in the retail pharmacy industry and as a retailer of general merchandise, we compete with various local, regional, national and global retailers, including chain and independent pharmacies, mail order prescription providers, grocery stores, convenience stores, mass merchants, online and omni-channel pharmacies and retailers, warehouse clubs, dollar stores and other discount merchandisers. Our pharmaceutical wholesale business competes with other pharmaceutical wholesalers as well as alternative supply sources such as importers and manufacturers who supply directly to pharmacies. We compete primarily on the basis of service, convenience, variety and price. Our geographic dispersion helps mitigate the impact of temporary, localized economic and competitive conditions in individual markets. See Properties in Part I, Item 2 below for further information regarding our geographic dispersion.Employees As of August 31, 2015, we employed approximately 360,000 persons, approximately 115,000 of whom were part-time employees working less than 30 hours per week. The foregoing does not include employees of unconsolidated partially-owned entities.Research and development While our global brands portfolio is enhanced by our in-house product research and development capabilities, the amount we spend on research and development activities is not material.Financial Information about Foreign and Domestic Operations and Export Sales Prior to completion of the Second Step Transaction, we accounted for our 45% investment in Alliance Boots using the equity method of accounting and as a result, no Alliance Boots sales were included in our net sales prior to December 31, 2014. All our sales in fiscal years 2014 and 2013 occurred within the United States, Puerto Rico, Guam and the U.S. Virgin Islands. Subsequent to the Second Step Transaction, Alliance Boots results have been fully consolidated. Certain financial information relating to foreign and domestic operations, including total revenues and long-lived assets aggregated by our U.S. and non-U.S. operations, is included in Note 19, Segment Reporting to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 below, which information is incorporated herein by reference. See Risk Factors in Part I, Item 1A below for information regarding risks attendant to our foreign operations.Available Information We file with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC) our Annual Report on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K and any amendments to those reports, as well as proxy statements and registration statements. You may read and copy any material we file with the SEC at the SECs Public Reference Room at 100 F Street, NE, Washington, D.C. 20549. You may also obtain information on the operation of the Public Reference Room by calling the SEC at 1-800-SEC-0330. In addition, the SEC maintains a website at http://www.sec.gov that contains reports, proxy and information statements, and other information regarding issuers, including us, that file electronically. We make available free of charge on or through our website at http://investor.walgreensbootsalliance.com our Annual Reports on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K and amendments to these reports filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Exchange Act as soon as reasonably practicable after we file or furnish them to the SEC. The contents of our website are not, however, a part of this Form 10-K or our other SEC filings.", "1A": " Item 1A. Risk Factors In addition to the other information in this report and our other filings with the SEC, you should carefully consider the risks described below, which could materially and adversely affect our business operations, financial condition and results of operations. These risks are not the only risks that we face. Our business operations could also be affected by additional factors that are not presently known to us or that we currently consider to be immaterial.Reductions in third party reimbursement levels, from private or governmental agency plans, and potential changes in industry pricing benchmarks for prescription drugs could adversely affect our results of operations.The substantial majority of the prescriptions we fill are reimbursed by third party payers, including private and governmental agency payers. The continued efforts of health maintenance organizations, managed care organizations, pharmacy benefit management companies, governmental agencies, and other third party payers to reduce prescription drug costs and pharmacy reimbursement rates, as well as litigation relating to how drugs are priced, may adversely impact our results of operations. In the United States, plan changes with rate adjustments often occur in January and our reimbursement arrangements may provide for rate adjustments at prescribed intervals during their term. In addition, some of these entities may offer pricing terms that we may not be willing to accept or otherwise restrict our participation in their networks of pharmacy providers.- 7 -In the United States, certain provisions of the Deficit Reduction Act of 2005 sought to reduce federal spending by altering AMP (the Medicaid reimbursement formula for multi-source (i.e., generic) drugs). While those reductions did not go into effect, the ACA, which was signed into law on March 23, 2010, enacted a modified AMP reimbursement formula for multi-source drugs that significantly affects reimbursement calculations. The modified formula, when implemented, is expected to reduce Medicaid reimbursements, which could adversely affect our results of operations. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) is preparing to use the modified reimbursement formula to calculate a U.S. federal ceiling on reimbursement rates for multi-source drugs to pharmacies under the Medicaid program, and posts draft federal upper limit (FUL) reimbursement files on the CMS website that are calculated based on the requirements of the health reform legislation. As of the date of this report, these draft FUL files are for review and comment only; however, CMS has announced that it plans to publish final FULs after a period of releasing them in draft format. CMS has issued proposed regulations to implement the ACAs provisions regarding Medicaid reimbursement to pharmacies, but to date the regulations have not been finalized. There have also been a number of other proposals and enactments by the federal government and various states to reduce Medicare Part D and Medicaid reimbursement levels in response to budget deficits, and we expect additional proposals in the future.Many payers in the United States are increasingly considering new metrics as the basis for reimbursement rates, such as average sales price, average manufacturer price, and actual acquisition cost. For example, CMS now makes national average drug acquisition cost data, which reflect retail community pharmacy invoice costs, publicly available on a regular basis. CMS has indicated that state Medicaid agencies can use this information to compare their own reimbursement and pricing methodologies and rates to those derived from the survey data. There can be no assurance that recent or future changes in prescription drug reimbursement policies and practices will not materially and adversely affect our results of operations.A shift in pharmacy mix toward lower margin plans and programs could adversely affect our results of operations.A shift in the mix of pharmacy prescription volume towards programs offering lower reimbursement rates could adversely affect our results of operations. Our Retail Pharmacy USA division continued to experience a shift in pharmacy mix towards 90-day at retail in fiscal 2015 and that trend is expected to continue in fiscal 2016. Our 90-day at retail offering for patients with chronic prescription needs typically is at a lower margin than comparable 30-day prescriptions. Additionally, we have accepted lower reimbursement rates in order to secure preferred relationships with Medicare Part D plans serving senior patients with significant pharmacy needs. If we are not able to generate additional prescription volume and other business from patients participating in these programs that is sufficient to offset the impact of lower reimbursement, our results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.We could be adversely affected by a decrease in the introduction of new brand name and generic prescription drugs.New brand name drugs can result in increased drug utilization and associated sales revenues, while the introduction of lower priced generic alternatives typically results in relatively lower sales revenues, but higher gross profit margins. Accordingly, a decrease in the number of significant new brand name drugs or generics successfully introduced could materially and adversely affect our results of operations.Generic drug inflation could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in the United States.Overall increases in the amounts we pay to procure generic drugs, commonly referred to as generic drug inflation, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, including particularly those of our Retail Pharmacy USA division. Our gross profit margins would be adversely affected by generic inflation to the extent we are not able to offset such cost increases. We experienced a shift from historical patterns of deflation in generic drug costs to inflation in fiscal 2014, when we experienced cost increases on a subset of generic drugs that in some cases were significant. This generic inflation continued with respect to certain generic drugs in fiscal 2015. Any failure to fully offset any such increased prices and costs or to modify our activities to mitigate the impact could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.- 8 -We derive a significant portion of our sales in the United States from prescription drug sales reimbursed by pharmacy benefit management companies.We derive a significant portion of our sales in the United States from prescription drug sales reimbursed through prescription drug plans administered by PBM companies. PBM companies typically administer multiple prescription drug plans that expire at various times and provide for varying reimbursement rates, and often limit coverage to specific drug products on an approved list, known as a formulary, which might not include all of the approved drugs for a particular indication. There can be no assurance that we will continue to participate in any particular PBM companys pharmacy provider network in any particular future time period. If our participation in the pharmacy provider network for a prescription drug plan administered by one or more of the large PBM companies is restricted or terminated, we expect that our sales would be adversely affected, at least in the short-term. If we are unable to replace any such lost sales, either through an increase in other sales or through a resumption of participation in those plans, our operating results could be materially and adversely affected. If we exit a pharmacy provider network and later resume participation, there can be no assurance that we will achieve any particular level of business on any particular pace, or that all clients of the PBM company will choose to include us again in the pharmacy network for their plans, initially or at all. In addition, in such circumstances we may incur increased marketing and other costs in connection with initiatives to regain former patients and attract new patients covered by such plans.Consolidation and strategic alliances in the healthcare industry could adversely affect our business operations, competitive positioning, financial condition and results of operations.Many organizations in the healthcare industry, including PBM companies and health insurance companies, have consolidated in recent years to create larger healthcare enterprises with greater bargaining power, which has resulted in greater pricing pressures. For example, in July 2015, OptumRx, UnitedHealth Groups pharmacy care services business, completed its combination with Catamaran Corporation, with the combined businesses expected to fulfill over one billion prescriptions in 2015 and be the third largest PBM company in the United States. In addition, significant business combinations within the health insurance industry were announced in July 2015, with Anthem, Inc. announcing its agreement to acquire Cigna Corporation, and Aetna, Inc. announcing its agreement to acquire Humana Inc., with the resulting enterprises expected to be two of the three largest health insurers in the United States. If this consolidation trend continues, it could give the resulting enterprises even greater bargaining power, which may lead to further pressure on the prices for our products and services. If these pressures result in reductions in our prices, our businesses would become less profitable unless we are able to achieve corresponding reductions in costs.Strategic alliances in the healthcare industry also impact our businesses and competitive positioning. For example, following the announcement of our agreement with AmerisourceBergen providing for, among other things, generic drug purchasing by Walgreens, Alliance Boots and AmerisourceBergen through WBAD, our global sourcing enterprise, some of our retail pharmacy competitors subsequently established relationships with other pharmaceutical drug wholesalers relating to generic drug procurement. In addition, further consolidation among generic drug manufacturers could lead to increased generic drug inflation in the future. We expect that market demand, government regulation, third-party reimbursement policies, government contracting requirements, and other pressures will continue to cause the healthcare industry to evolve, potentially resulting in further business consolidations and alliances among the industry participants we engage with, and which may materially and adversely impact our business operations, financial condition and results of operations.We may not be able to successfully or timely complete the pending acquisition of Rite Aid.Risks and uncertainties related to our pending acquisition of Rite Aid include, among others: the occurrence of any event, change or other circumstance that could give rise to the termination of the Merger Agreement including the failure of Rite Aid to obtain the approval of its stockholders of the transaction; that regulatory or other approvals required for the transaction are not obtained; that litigation may be filed which could prevent or delay the transaction; and that uncertainty regarding the transaction may adversely affect our and Rite Aid's relationships with suppliers, payers, customers and other third parties with which we or Rite Aid do business. Completion of the transaction is subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement, including the expiration or termination of applicable waiting periods (and any extensions thereof) under the Hart-Scott- Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended, approval of the transaction by Rite Aid stockholders, no material adverse effect having occurred with respect to Rite Aid prior to the closing of the transaction and other customary conditions. We will be unable to complete the pending acquisition of Rite Aid until each of the conditions to closing is either satisfied or waived. In deciding whether or not to object to the transaction, regulatory agencies have broad discretion in administering the applicable governing regulations. As a condition to their approval of the transaction, these agencies may impose requirements, limitations or costs or require divestitures or place restrictions on the conduct of our business after consummation of the transaction. These requirements, limitations, costs, divestitures or restrictions may reduce the anticipated benefits of the transaction or affect our results of operations after the closing of the transaction. Further, we can provide no assurance that we will obtain the necessary approvals or that any such conditions that are imposed would not diminish the anticipated benefits of the transaction or result in the termination of the transaction. In the event that the transaction is not completed due to the failure to obtain antitrust clearance, we could be required to pay Rite Aid a termination fee of $325 million or $650 million in certain circumstances. While our acquisition of Rite Aid is pending, it creates uncertainty that may adversely affect our business and results of operations, including with respect to our relationships with suppliers, payers, customers and other third parties with which we do business. Further, we have incurred and will continue to incur significant costs, expenses and fees for professional services and other transaction costs in connection with the pending transaction, as well as the diversion of management resources, for which we will receive little or no benefit if the closing of the transaction does not occur.If we complete our pending acquisition of Rite Aid, we may not realize the anticipated benefits of the transaction which could adversely impact our results of operations.We entered into the Merger Agreement with the expectation that the transaction will result in various benefits, including, among other things, cost savings and operating efficiencies. The achievement of the anticipated benefits of the transaction is subject to a number of uncertainties, including whether Rite Aid's business can be integrated into ours in an efficient and effective manner. If the Rite Aid transaction is completed, we can provide no assurance that the anticipated benefits of the transaction , including cost savings and synergies, will be fully realized in the time frame anticipated or at all; the costs or difficulties related to the integration of Rite Aid's business and operations into ours will not be greater than expected; unanticipated costs, charges and expenses will not result from the transaction; litigation relating to the transaction will not be filed; we will be able to retain key personnel; and the transaction will not cause disruption to the parties' business and operations and relationships with employees and suppliers, payers, customers and other third parties with which we do business. If one or more of these risks are realized, it could have a material adverse impact on our operating results. The anticipated strategic and financial benefits of our acquisition of Alliance Boots may not be realized.Walgreens and Alliance Boots entered into the Purchase and Option Agreement dated June 18, 2012, as amended on August 5, 2014 (as amended, the Purchase and Option Agreement), and consummated the first and second step transactions contemplated thereby, with the expectation that the transactions would result in various benefits including, among other things, procurement cost savings and operating efficiencies, revenue synergies, increased innovation, sharing of best practices, and a strengthened market position that may serve as a platform for future growth. The processes and initiatives needed to achieve these potential benefits are complex, costly, and time consuming, and we have not previously completed a transaction comparable in size or scope. Many of the expenses that will be incurred, by their nature, are difficult to estimate accurately. Achieving the expected benefits of the Alliance Boots transaction is subject to a number of significant challenges and uncertainties, including, without limitation, whether unique corporate cultures will work collaboratively in an efficient and effective manner, the coordination of geographically separate organizations, the possibility of faulty assumptions underlying expectations regarding potential synergies and the integration process, unforeseen expenses or delays, and competitive factors in the marketplace.Prior to the Alliance Boots acquisition on December 31, 2014, Alliance Boots was a privately-held company and was not subject to the information and reporting requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended and other federal securities laws, and the compliance obligations of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. Compliance with these new obligations as a result of Alliance Boots becoming a part of a public company has required and may continue to require significant resources and management attention, and any failure to comply could have a material adverse effect on us. In addition, some current and prospective employees may experience uncertainty about their roles within the combined company, which may adversely affect our ability to retain or recruit key managers and other employees. We could also encounter unforeseen transaction and integration-related costs or other circumstances, such as unforeseen liabilities or other issues existing or arising with respect to the business of Alliance Boots or otherwise resulting from the transaction. Many of these potential circumstances are outside of our control and any of them could result in increased costs, decreased revenue, decreased synergies and the diversion of management time and attention. If we are unable to achieve our objectives within the anticipated time frame, or at all, the expected benefits may not be realized fully or at all, or may take longer to realize than expected, which could have a material adverse impact on our business operations, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, we have incurred significant transaction costs related to the acquisition and have incurred and will continue to incur integration and related costs as we integrate the Alliance Boots businesses. These integration and acquisition-related costs, including legal, accounting, financial and tax advisory and other fees and costs, may be higher than expected and some of these costs may be material.- 9 -Our operations outside of the United States subject us to a number of operating, economic, political, regulatory and other international business risks.Together with our equity method investments, we had a presence in over 25 countries as of August 31, 2015. The strategic combination with Alliance Boots in December 2014 greatly increased the importance of international business to our operations, growth and prospects as, historically, substantially all of Walgreens business operations had been conducted within the United States and its territories. A substantial portion of Alliance Boots revenues are generated in the European Union and neighboring countries, and substantially all of Alliance Boots revenues are generated outside the United States. Our international business operations are subject to a number of risks, including:##TABLE_START  compliance with a wide variety of foreign laws and regulations, including retail and wholesale pharmacy, licensing, tax, foreign trade, intellectual property, privacy and data protection, currency, political and other business restrictions and requirements and local laws and regulations, whose interpretation and enforcement vary significantly among jurisdictions and can change significantly over time; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  additional U.S. and other regulation of non-domestic operations, including regulation under the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the U.K. Bribery Act and other anti-corruption laws; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  potential difficulties in managing foreign operations, mitigating credit risks in foreign markets, enforcing agreements and collecting receivables through foreign legal systems; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  price controls imposed by foreign countries; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  tariffs, duties or other restrictions on foreign currencies or trade sanctions and other trade barriers imposed by foreign countries; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  potential adverse tax consequences, including tax withholding laws and policies and restrictions on repatriation of funds to the United States; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  fluctuations in currency exchange rates, including uncertainty regarding the Euro; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  impact of recessions and economic slowdowns in economies outside the United States, including foreign currency devaluation, higher interest rates, inflation, and increased government regulation or ownership of traditional private businesses; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  the instability of foreign economies, governments and currencies and unexpected regulatory, economic or political changes in foreign markets; and ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  developing and emerging markets may be especially vulnerable to periods of instability and unexpected changes, and consumers in those markets may have relatively limited resources to spend on products and services. ##TABLE_END These factors can also adversely affect our payers, vendors and customers in international markets, which in turn can negatively impact our businesses. We cannot assure you that one or more of these factors will not have a material adverse effect on our business operations, results of operation or financial condition.Our significant operations outside of the United States also expose us to currency exchange rate fluctuations and related risks, including transaction currency exposures relating to the import and export of goods in currencies other than businesses functional currencies as well as currency translation exposures relating to profits and net assets denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. We present our financial statements in U.S. dollars and, since the completion of the strategic combination with Alliance Boots in December 2014, have had a significant proportion of net assets and income in non-U.S. dollar currencies, primarily British Pounds Sterling and the Euro, as well as a range of emerging market currencies. Our results of operations and capital ratios can therefore be sensitive to movements in foreign exchange rates. Due to the constantly changing currency exposures to which we are subject and the volatility of currency exchange rates, we cannot predict the effect of exchange rate fluctuations upon our future results of operations. In addition, fluctuations in currencies relative to the U.S. dollar may make it more difficult to perform period-to-period comparisons of our reported results of operations. A depreciation of non-U.S. dollar currencies relative to the U.S. dollar could have a significant adverse impact on our results of operations.- 10 -We may from time to time, in some instances enter into foreign currency contracts or other derivative instruments intended to hedge a portion of our foreign currency fluctuation risks, which subjects us to additional risks such as the risk that counterparties may fail to honor their obligations to us. Additionally, we may (and currently do) use foreign currency borrowings to hedge some of our foreign currency fluctuation risks. The periodic use of such hedging activities may not offset any or more than a portion of the adverse financial effects of unfavorable movements in foreign exchange rates over the limited time the hedges are in place. We cannot assure you that fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, including particularly the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against major currencies or the currencies of large developing countries, will not materially affect our consolidated financial results.Our business results depend on our ability to successfully manage ongoing organizational change and achieve cost savings initiatives.In April 2015, our Board of Directors approved a plan to implement the Cost Transformation Program described in MDA in Part II, Item 7 below as part of an initiative to reduce costs and increase operating efficiencies. There can be no assurance that we will realize, in full or in part, the anticipated benefits of this program. Our financial goals assume a level of productivity improvement, including those reflected in our Cost Transformation Program and other business optimization initiatives. If we are unable to deliver these expected productivity improvements, while continuing to invest in business growth, our financial results could be adversely impacted. Our ability to successfully manage and execute these initiatives and realize expected savings and benefits in the amounts and at the times anticipated is important to our business success. Any failure to do so, which could result from our inability to successfully execute plans, changes in global or regional economic conditions, competition, changes in the industries in which we compete, unanticipated costs or charges, loss of key personnel and other factors described herein, could have a material adverse effect on our businesses, financial condition and results of operations.Disruption in our global supply chain could negatively impact our businesses.The products we sell are sourced from a wide variety of domestic and international vendors, and any future disruption in our supply chain or inability to find qualified vendors and access products that meet requisite quality and safety standards in a timely and efficient manner could adversely impact our businesses. The loss or disruption of such supply arrangements for any reason, including for issues such as labor disputes, loss or impairment of key manufacturing sites, inability to procure sufficient raw materials, quality control issues, ethical sourcing issues, the suppliers financial distress, natural disasters, civil unrest or acts of war or terrorism or other external factors over which we have no control, could interrupt product supply and, if not effectively managed and remedied, have a material adverse impact on our business operations, financial condition and results of operations.We use a single wholesaler of branded and generic pharmaceutical drugs as our primary source of such products for our Retail Pharmacy USA division.On March 19, 2013, Walgreens, Alliance Boots and AmerisourceBergen announced various agreements and arrangements, including a ten-year pharmaceutical distribution agreement between Walgreens and AmerisourceBergen pursuant to which Walgreens sources branded and generic pharmaceutical products from AmerisourceBergen; an agreement which provides AmerisourceBergen the ability to access generics and related pharmaceutical products through WBAD, a global sourcing enterprise established by Walgreens and Alliance Boots; and agreements and arrangements pursuant to which we have the right, but not the obligation, to purchase a minority equity position in AmerisourceBergen and gain associated representation on AmerisourceBergens board of directors in certain circumstances. As of the date of this report, AmerisourceBergen distributes for our Retail Pharmacy USA division all branded pharmaceutical products that Walgreens historically sourced from suppliers and distributors as well as substantially all generic pharmaceutical products that Walgreens previously self-distributed. Consequently, our business in the United States may be adversely affected by any operational, financial or regulatory difficulties that AmerisourceBergen experiences. For example, if AmerisourceBergens operations are seriously disrupted for any reason, whether due to a natural disaster, labor disruption, regulatory action, computer or operational systems or otherwise, it could adversely affect our business in the United States and our results of operations.Our distribution agreement with AmerisourceBergen is subject to early termination in certain circumstances and, upon the expiration or termination of the agreement, there can be no assurance that we or AmerisourceBergen will be willing to renew the agreement or enter into a new agreement, on terms favorable to us or at all. If such expiration or termination occurred, we believe that alternative sources of supply for most generic and brand-name pharmaceuticals are readily available and that we could obtain and qualify alternative sources, which may include resuming self-distribution in some cases, for substantially all of the prescription drugs we sell on an acceptable basis, such that the impact of any expiration or termination would be temporary. However, there can be no assurance we would be able to engage alternative supply sources or implement self-distribution processes on a timely basis or on terms favorable to us, or effectively manage these transitions, any of which could adversely affect our business operations, financial condition and results of operations.- 11 -The anticipated strategic and financial benefits of our relationship with AmerisourceBergen may not be realized.Walgreens entered into the arrangement with AmerisourceBergen and Alliance Boots with the expectation that the transactions contemplated thereby would result in various benefits including, among other things, procurement cost savings and operating efficiencies, innovation and sharing of best practices. The processes and initiatives needed to achieve these potential benefits are complex, costly and time-consuming. Many of the anticipated synergies and expenses that will be incurred, by their nature, are difficult to estimate accurately at the present time. Achieving the anticipated benefits from the arrangement is subject to a number of significant challenges and uncertainties, including the possibility of faulty assumptions underlying expectations, processes or initiatives, or the inability to realize and/or delays in realizing potential benefits and synergies, whether unique corporate cultures of separate organizations will work collaboratively in an efficient and effective manner, unforeseen expenses or delays, and competitive factors in the marketplace.In addition, we have the right, but not the obligation, under the transactions contemplated by the Framework Agreement dated as of March 18, 2013 by and among the Company, Alliance Boots and AmerisourceBergen (the Framework Agreement) to invest in the equity of AmerisourceBergen. There can be no assurance that we will complete any specific level of such potential equity investments in AmerisourceBergen, or exercise our warrants to acquire AmerisourceBergen common stock when they are exercisable, or that if completed, that such investments will ultimately be profitable. If such investments are completed and the price of AmerisourceBergen common stock subsequently declines substantially, we could experience a loss on or impairment of such investment, which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. We could also encounter unforeseen costs, circumstances or issues existing or arising with respect to the transactions and collaboration we anticipate resulting from the Framework Agreement. Many of these potential circumstances are outside of our control and any of them could result in increased costs, decreased revenue, decreased synergies and the diversion of management time and attention. If we are unable to achieve our objectives within the anticipated time frame, or at all, the expected benefits may not be realized fully or at all, or may take longer to realize than expected, which could have a material adverse impact on our business operations, financial condition and results of operations.From time to time, we make investments in companies over which we do not have sole control, including our investment in AmerisourceBergen. Some of these companies may operate in sectors that differ from our current operations and have different risks.From time to time, we make debt or equity investments in other companies that we may not control or over which we may not have sole control. For example, while we beneficially own approximately 5% of the outstanding common stock and have a designee serving on the board of directors of AmerisourceBergen, we do not and will not have the ability to control day-to-day operations of that company. Although the businesses in which we have made non-controlling investments often have a significant health and daily living or prescription drug component, some of them operate in businesses that are different from our primary lines of business and/or operate in different geographic markets than we do. Investments in these businesses, among other risks, subject us to the operating and financial risks of the businesses we invest in and to the risk that we do not have sole control over the operations of these businesses.From time to time, we may make additional investments in or acquire other entities that may subject us to similar risks. The completion of the Second Step Transaction increased our and our stockholders effective interest in certain equity method investments and other investments of Alliance Boots over which Alliance Boots does not exercise control. We rely on the internal controls and financial reporting controls of these entities and their failure to maintain effectiveness or comply with applicable standards may materially and adversely affect us. Investments in entities over which we do not have sole control, including joint ventures and strategic alliances, present additional risks such as having differing objectives from our partners or the entities in which we are invested, becoming involved in disputes, or competing with those persons.Changes in economic conditions could adversely affect consumer buying practices.Our performance has been, and may continue to be, adversely impacted by changes in global, national, regional or local economic conditions and consumer confidence. These conditions can also adversely affect our key vendors and customers. External factors that affect consumer confidence and over which we exercise no influence include unemployment rates, levels of personal disposable income, and global, national, regional or local economic conditions, as well as acts of war or terrorism. Changes in economic conditions and consumer confidence could adversely affect consumer preferences, purchasing power and spending patterns, which could lead to a decrease in overall consumer spending. In addition, reduced or flat consumer spending may drive us and our competitors to offer additional products at promotional prices. All of these factors could materially and adversely impact our business operations, financial condition and results of operations.- 12 -European economic conditions together with austerity measures being taken by certain European governments could adversely affect us.The acquisition of Alliance Boots significantly increased our assets and operations within Europe and, accordingly, our exposure to economic conditions in Europe. A further slowdown within the European economy could affect our businesses in Europe by reducing the prices our customers may be able or willing to pay for our products and services or by reducing the demand for our products and services, either of which could result in a material adverse impact on our results of operations. In addition, in many European countries, the government provides or subsidizes healthcare to consumers and regulates pharmaceutical prices, patient eligibility, and reimbursement levels to control costs for the government-sponsored healthcare system. In recent years, in response to the economic environment and financial crisis in Europe, a number of European governments have announced or implemented austerity measures to reduce healthcare spending and constrain overall government expenditures. These measures, which include efforts aimed at reforming healthcare coverage and reducing healthcare costs, continue to exert pressure on the pricing of and reimbursement timelines for pharmaceutical drugs. Countries with existing austerity measures may impose additional laws, regulations, or requirements on the healthcare industry. In addition, European governments that have not yet imposed austerity measures may impose them in the future. Any new austerity measures may be similar to or vary in scope and nature from existing austerity measures and could have a material adverse effect on our international business operations and results of operations.The industries in which we operate are highly competitive.The level of competition among retail pharmacies and pharmaceutical wholesalers is high. Changes in market dynamics or actions of competitors or manufacturers, including industry consolidation and the emergence of new competitors, could materially and adversely impact us. Our retail pharmacy businesses face intense competition from local, regional, national and global companies, including other drugstore and pharmacy chains, independent drugstores and pharmacies, mail-order prescription providers and various other retailers such as grocery stores, convenience stores, mass merchants, online and omni-channel pharmacies and retailers, warehouse clubs, dollar stores and other discount merchandisers, some of which are aggressively expanding in markets we serve. Businesses in our Pharmaceutical Wholesale division face intense competition from direct competitors, including national and regional cooperative wholesalers, and alternative supply sources such as importers and manufacturers who supply directly to pharmacies. Competition may also come from other sources in the future. As competition increases in the markets in which we operate, a significant increase in general pricing pressures could occur, which could require us to reevaluate our pricing structures to remain competitive. For example, if we are not able to anticipate and successfully respond to changes in market conditions in our pharmaceutical wholesale division, including changes driven by competitors, suppliers or manufacturers, it could result in a loss of customers or renewal of contracts or arrangements on less favorable terms. Any failure to anticipate and timely and appropriately respond to evolving market conditions could result in decreased revenue and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.If the merchandise and services that we offer fail to meet customer needs, our sales may be adversely affected.We could be adversely affected by changes in consumer spending levels and shopping habits and preferences, including attitudes towards our retail and product brands. The success of our retail pharmacy businesses depends on our ability to offer a superior shopping experience, a quality assortment of available merchandise, and superior customer service. We must identify, obtain supplies of, and offer to our customers attractive, innovative and high-quality merchandise on a continuous basis. Our products and services must satisfy the needs and desires of our customers, whose preferences may change in the future. It is difficult to predict consistently and successfully the products and services our customers will demand. If we misjudge either the demand for products and services we sell or our customers purchasing habits and tastes, we may be faced with excess inventories of some products and missed opportunities for products and services we chose not to offer. In addition, our sales may decline or we may be required to sell the merchandise we have obtained at lower prices. Failure to timely identify or effectively respond to changing consumer tastes, preferences and spending patterns could negatively affect our relationship with our customers and the demand for our products and services, which could materially and adversely impact our results of operations.- 13 -Our private brand offerings expose us to various additional risks.In addition to brand name products, we offer our customers private brand products that are not available from other retailers. We seek to continue to grow our exclusive private brand offerings as part of our growth strategy, including through the expanded offering of Boots No7 and other brands owned or licensed on an exclusive basis, as well as through selective acquisitions. Maintaining consistent product quality, competitive pricing, and availability of our private brand offerings for our customers is important in differentiating us from other retailers and developing and maintaining customer loyalty. Although we believe that our private brand products offer value to our customers and typically provide us with higher gross margins than comparable national brand products we sell, the expansion of our private brand offerings also subjects us to additional risks, such as potential product liability risks and mandatory or voluntary product recalls; our ability to successfully protect our proprietary rights and successfully navigate and avoid claims related to the proprietary rights of third parties; our ability to successfully administer and comply with applicable contractual obligations and regulatory requirements; and other risks generally encountered by entities that source, sell and market exclusive branded offerings for retail. An increase in sales of our private brands may also adversely affect sales of our vendors products, which, in turn, could adversely affect our relationship with certain of our vendors. Any failure to adequately address some or all of these risks could have a material adverse effect on our business operations, results of operations and financial condition.If we do not successfully develop and maintain a relevant omni-channel experience for our customers, our businesses and results of operations could be adversely impacted.Our business has evolved from an in-store experience to interaction with customers across numerous channels, including in-store, online, mobile and social media, among others. Omni-channel retailing is rapidly evolving and we must keep pace with changing customer expectations and new developments by our competitors. Our customers are increasingly using computers, tablets, mobile phones, and other devices to comparison shop, determine product availability and complete purchases online. We must compete by offering a consistent and convenient shopping experience for our customers regardless of the ultimate sales channel and by investing in, providing and maintaining digital tools for our customers that have the right features and are reliable and easy to use. If we are unable to make, improve, or develop relevant customer-facing technology in a timely manner, our ability to compete and our results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. In addition, if our online activities or our other customer-facing technology systems do not function as designed, we may experience a loss of customer confidence, data security breaches, lost sales, or be exposed to fraudulent purchases, any of which could materially and adversely affect our business operations, reputation and results of operations.We may be constrained if we are unable to find suitable new store locations at acceptable prices or by the terms of our current leases.Our ability to grow our retail pharmacy businesses may be constrained if suitable new store locations cannot be identified with lease terms or purchase prices that are acceptable to us. We compete with other retailers and businesses for suitable locations for our stores. Local land use and other regulations applicable to the types of stores we desire to construct may impact our ability to find suitable locations and influence the cost of constructing our stores. The termination or expiration of leases at existing store locations may adversely affect us if the renewal terms of those leases are unacceptable to us and we are forced to close or relocate stores. Further, changing local demographics at existing store locations may adversely affect revenue and profitability levels at those stores.We may experience a significant disruption in our computer systems.We rely extensively on our computer systems to manage our ordering, pricing, point-of-sale, pharmacy fulfillment, inventory replenishment, customer loyalty programs, finance and other processes. Our systems are subject to damage or interruption from power outages, computer and telecommunications failures, computer viruses, security breaches, vandalism, natural disasters, catastrophic events and human error, and our disaster recovery planning cannot account for all eventualities. If any of our systems are damaged, fail to function properly or otherwise become unavailable, we may incur substantial costs to repair or replace them, and may experience loss or corruption of critical data and interruptions or delays in our ability to perform critical functions, which could adversely affect our businesses and results of operations. In addition, we are currently making, and expect to continue to make, substantial investments in our information technology systems and infrastructure, some of which are significant. Upgrades involve replacing existing systems with successor systems, making changes to existing systems, or cost-effectively acquiring new systems with new functionality. Implementing new systems carries significant potential risks, including failure to operate as designed, potential loss or corruption of data or information, cost overruns, implementation delays, disruption of operations, and the potential inability to meet business and reporting requirements. While we are aware of inherent risks associated with replacing these systems and believe we are taking reasonable action to mitigate known risks, there can be no assurance that these technology initiatives will be deployed as planned or that they will be timely implemented without disruption to our operations. We also could be adversely affected by any significant disruption in the systems of key payers or vendors.- 14 -If we do not maintain the privacy and security of sensitive customer and business information, we could damage our reputation, suffer a loss of revenue, incur substantial additional costs and become subject to litigation.The protection of customer, employee, and company data is critical to our businesses. Cybersecurity and other information technology security risks, such as a significant breach of customer, employee, or company data, could attract a substantial amount of media attention, damage our customer relationships and reputation, and result in lost sales, fines or lawsuits. Throughout our operations, we receive, retain and transmit certain personal information that our customers and others provide to purchase products or services, fill prescriptions, enroll in promotional programs, participate in our customer loyalty programs, register on our websites, or otherwise communicate and interact with us. In addition, aspects of our operations depend upon the secure transmission of confidential information over public networks. Although we deploy a layered approach to address information security threats and vulnerabilities designed to protect confidential information against data security breaches, a compromise of our data security systems or of those of businesses with whom we interact, which results in confidential information being accessed, obtained, damaged or used by unauthorized or improper persons, could harm our reputation and expose us to regulatory actions and claims from customers, financial institutions, payment card associations and other persons, any of which could materially and adversely affect our business operations, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, a security breach could require that we expend substantial additional resources related to the security of information systems and disrupt our businesses.The regulatory environment surrounding information security and privacy is increasingly demanding, with the frequent imposition of new and changing requirements across businesses. We are required to comply with increasingly complex and changing data privacy regulations in the United States and in other countries in which we operate that regulate the collection, use and transfer of personal data, including the transfer of personal data between or among countries. Some foreign data privacy regulations are more stringent than those in the United States. We may also face audits or investigations by one or more domestic or foreign government agencies relating to our compliance with these regulations. Compliance with changes in privacy and information security laws and standards may result in significant expense due to increased investment in technology and the development of new operational processes. If we or those with whom we share information fail to comply with these laws and regulations or experience a data security breach, our reputation could be damaged and we could be subject to additional litigation and regulatory risks. Our security measures may be undermined due to the actions of outside parties, employee error, malfeasance, or otherwise, and, as a result, an unauthorized party may obtain access to our data systems and misappropriate business and personal information. Because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access, disable or degrade service, or sabotage systems change frequently and may not immediately produce signs of intrusion, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures. Any such breach or unauthorized access could result in significant legal and financial exposure, damage to our reputation, and potentially have a material adverse effect on our business operations, financial condition and results of operations.We are subject to payment-related risks that could increase our operating costs, expose us to fraud or theft, subject us to potential liability and potentially disrupt our business operations.We accept payments using a variety of methods, including cash, checks, credit and debit cards, Apple Pay and gift cards, and we may offer new payment options over time. Acceptance of these payment options subjects us to rules, regulations, contractual obligations and compliance requirements, including payment network rules and operating guidelines, data security standards and certification requirements, and rules governing electronic funds transfers. These requirements and related interpretations may change over time, which could make compliance more difficult or costly. For certain payment methods, including credit and debit cards, we pay interchange and other fees, which could increase over time and raise our operating costs. We rely on third parties to provide payment processing services, including the processing of credit cards, debit cards, and other forms of electronic payment. If these companies become unable to provide these services to us, or if their systems are compromised, it could disrupt our business. The payment methods that we offer also subject us to potential fraud and theft by persons who seek to obtain unauthorized access to or exploit any weaknesses that may exist in the payment systems. If we fail to comply with applicable rules or requirements, or if data is compromised due to a breach or misuse of data relating to our payment systems, we may be liable for costs incurred by payment card issuing banks and other third parties or subject to fines and higher transaction fees, or our ability to accept or facilitate certain types of payments could be impaired. In addition, our reputation could suffer and our customers could lose confidence in certain payment types, which could result in higher costs and/or reduced sales and materially and adversely affect our results of operations.- 15 -Our growth strategy is partially dependent upon acquisitions, joint ventures and other strategic investments, some of which may not prove to be successful.We have grown, in part, through acquisitions in recent years and expect to continue to acquire or invest in businesses that build on or are deemed complementary to our existing businesses or further our growth strategies. Acquisitions involve numerous risks, including difficulties in integrating the operations and personnel of the acquired companies, distraction of management from overseeing, and disruption of, our existing operations, difficulties in entering markets or lines of business in which we have no or limited direct prior experience, the possible loss of key employees and customers, and difficulties in achieving the synergies we anticipated. Any failure to select suitable acquisitions at fair prices, conduct appropriate due diligence and successfully integrate the acquired company, including particularly when acquired businesses operate in new geographic markets or areas of business, could materially and adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations. These transactions may also cause us to significantly increase our interest expense, leverage and debt service requirements if we incur additional debt to pay for an acquisition or investment, issue common stock that would dilute our current stockholders percentage ownership, or incur asset write-offs and restructuring costs and other related expenses.Acquisitions, joint ventures and strategic investments involve numerous other risks, including potential exposure to unknown liabilities, as well as undetected internal control, regulatory or other issues, or additional costs not anticipated at the time the transaction was completed. No assurance can be given that our acquisitions, joint ventures and other strategic investments will be successful and will not materially adversely affect our business operations, financial condition or results of operations.Changes in healthcare regulatory environments may adversely affect our businesses.Political, economic and regulatory influences are subjecting the healthcare industry to significant changes that could adversely affect our results of operations. In recent years, the healthcare industry has undergone significant changes in an effort to reduce costs and government spending. These changes include an increased reliance on managed care; cuts in certain Medicare and Medicaid funding in the United States and the funding of governmental payers in foreign jurisdictions; consolidation of competitors, suppliers and other market participants; and the development of large, sophisticated purchasing groups. We expect the healthcare industry to continue to change significantly in the future. Some of these potential changes, such as a reduction in governmental funding at the state or federal level for certain healthcare services or adverse changes in legislation or regulations governing prescription drug pricing, healthcare services or mandated benefits, may cause customers to reduce the amount of our products and services they purchase or the price they are willing to pay for our products and services. We expect continued governmental and private payer pressure to reduce pharmaceutical pricing. Changes in pharmaceutical manufacturers pricing or distribution policies could also significantly reduce our profitability.The ACA was enacted in 2010 to provide health insurance coverage to millions of previously uninsured Americans through a combination of insurance market reforms, an expansion of Medicaid, subsidies and health insurance mandates. While certain provisions of the ACA have already taken effect, others have delayed effective dates or require further rulemaking action or regulatory guidance by governmental agencies to implement and/or finalize. As a result, there remains considerable uncertainty as to the full impact of ACA on our business operations. Future rulemaking or other regulatory actions under the ACA or otherwise could increase regulation of pharmacy services, result in changes to pharmacy reimbursement rates, and otherwise change the way we do business. We cannot predict the timing or impact of any future rulemaking or other regulatory actions, but any such actions could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations.A significant change in, or noncompliance with, governmental regulations and other legal requirements could have a material adverse effect on our reputation and profitability.We operate in a complex, highly regulated environment in the United States and in the other countries in which we operate and could be adversely affected by changes to existing legal requirements, new legal requirements and/or any failure to comply with applicable regulations. Businesses in our Pharmaceutical Wholesale division are subject to a range of regulations relating to such things as product margins, product traceability and the conditions under which products must be stored. Our retail pharmacy and health and wellness services businesses are subject to numerous country, state and local regulations including licensing and other requirements for pharmacies and reimbursement arrangements. The regulations to which we are subject include, but are not limited to: country, and state registration and regulation of pharmacies; dispensing and sale of controlled substances and products containing pseudoephedrine; applicable governmental payer regulations including Medicare and Medicaid; data privacy and security laws and regulations including HIPAA; the ACA; laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment and health and safety matters, including those governing exposure to, and the management and disposal of, hazardous substances; regulations regarding food and drug safety including those of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), trade regulations including those of the U.S. Federal Trade Commission, and consumer protection and safety regulations including those of the Consumer Product Safety Commission, as well as state regulatory authorities, governing the availability, sale, advertisement and promotion of products we sell; anti-kickback laws; false claims laws; laws against the corporate practice of medicine; and foreign, national and state laws governing the practice of the profession of pharmacy. For example, in the United States the DEA, FDA and various other regulatory authorities regulate the distribution and dispensing of pharmaceuticals and controlled substances. We are required to hold valid DEA and state-level licenses, meet various security and operating standards and comply with the Controlled Substance Act and its accompanying regulations governing the sale, dispensing, disposal, holding and distribution of controlled substances. The DEA, FDA and state regulatory authorities have broad enforcement powers, including the ability to seize or recall products and impose significant criminal, civil and administrative sanctions for violations of these laws and regulations. We are also governed by foreign, national and state laws of general applicability, including laws regulating matters of working conditions, health and safety and equal employment opportunity. In addition, we could have significant exposure if we are found to have infringed another partys intellectual property rights.- 16 -Changes in laws, regulations and policies and the related interpretations may alter the landscape in which we do business and may affect our costs of doing business. The impact of new laws, regulations and policies generally cannot be predicted, and changes in applicable laws, regulations and policies may require extensive system and operational changes, be difficult to implement, increase our operating costs and require significant capital expenditures. Untimely compliance or noncompliance with applicable laws and regulations could result in the imposition of civil and criminal penalties that could adversely affect the continued operation of our businesses, including: suspension of payments from government programs; loss of required government certifications; loss of authorizations to participate in or exclusion from government programs, including the Medicare and Medicaid programs in the United States; loss of licenses; and significant fines or monetary penalties. Any failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements in the United States or in any of the countries in which we operate could result in significant legal and financial exposure, damage our reputation, and have a material adverse effect on our business operations, financial condition and results of operations.We could be adversely affected by product liability, product recall or personal injury issues.We could be adversely impacted by the supply of defective products, including the infiltration of counterfeit products into the supply chain, errors in re-labelling of products, product tampering, product recall and contamination or product mishandling issues. Through our pharmacies, we are also exposed to risks relating to the services we provide. Errors in the dispensing and packaging of pharmaceuticals could lead to serious injury or death. Product liability or personal injury claims may be asserted against us with respect to any of the products or pharmaceuticals we sell or services we provide. Our healthcare clinics also increase our exposure to professional liability claims related to medical care. Should a product or other liability issue arise, the coverage limits under our insurance programs and the indemnification amounts available to us may not be adequate to protect us against claims. We also may not be able to maintain this insurance on acceptable terms in the future. Damage to our reputation in the event of a product liability or personal injury issue or judgment against us or a product recall could have a material adverse effect on our business operations, financial condition and results of operations.We have significant outstanding debt; our debt and associated payment obligations could significantly increase in the future if we incur additional debt and do not retire existing debt.We have outstanding debt and other financial obligations and significant unused borrowing capacity. As of August 31, 2015, we had approximately $14.4 billion of outstanding indebtedness, including short-term borrowings. Our debt level and related debt service obligations could have negative consequences, including:##TABLE_START  requiring us to dedicate significant cash flow from operations to the payment of principal, interest and other amounts payable on our debt, which would reduce the funds we have available for other purposes, such as working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, share repurchases and dividends; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  making it more difficult or expensive for us to obtain any necessary future financing for working capital, capital expenditures, debt service requirements, debt refinancing, acquisitions or other purposes; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  reducing our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our industry and market conditions; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  making us more vulnerable in the event of a downturn in our business operations; and ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  exposing us to interest rate risk given that a portion of our debt obligations is at variable interest rates. ##TABLE_END - 17 -We may incur or assume significantly more debt in the future, including in connection with acquisitions, strategic investments or joint ventures. For example, we incurred significant additional debt in connection with the Second Step Transaction. Further, we intend to finance our pending acquisition of Rite Aid through a combination of cash on hand and debt financing. We have entered into a bridge facility commitment letter and expect to obtain permanent financing to replace such bridge facility prior to the closing of the transaction, but cannot guarantee that we will obtain such permanent financing on terms that are acceptable to us or at all. See Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in Part II , Item 7 below and Note 21, Subsequent Event, to our Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II , Item 8 below. If we add new debt and do not retire existing debt, the risks described above could increase. We also could be adversely impacted by any failure to renew or replace, on terms acceptable to us or at all, existing funding arrangements when they expire, and any failure to satisfy applicable covenants.Our long-term debt obligations include covenants that may adversely affect our ability, and the ability of certain of our subsidiaries, to incur certain secured indebtedness or engage in certain types of transactions. In addition, our existing credit agreements require us to maintain as of the last day of each fiscal quarter a ratio of consolidated debt to total capitalization not to exceed a certain level. Our ability to comply with these restrictions and covenants may be affected by events beyond our control. If we breach any of these restrictions or covenants and do not obtain a waiver from the lenders, then, subject to applicable cure periods, our outstanding indebtedness could be declared immediately due and payable. This could have a material adverse effect on our business operations and financial condition.Our credit ratings and ability to access well-functioning capital markets are important to us.Historically, we have relied on the public debt capital markets to fund portions of our capital investments and access to the commercial paper market and bank credit facilities as part of our working capital management strategy. Our continued access to these markets, and the terms of such access, depend on multiple factors including the condition of debt capital markets, our operating performance, and our credit ratings. The major credit rating agencies have assigned us and our corporate debt investment grade credit ratings. These ratings are based on a number of factors, which include their assessment of our financial strength and financial policies. We aim to maintain investment grade ratings as they serve to lower our borrowing costs and facilitate our access to a variety of lenders and other creditors, including landlords for our leased stores, on terms that we consider advantageous to our businesses. However, there can be no assurance that any particular rating assigned to us will remain in effect for any given period of time or that a rating will not be changed or withdrawn by a rating agency, if in that rating agency's judgment, future circumstances relating to the basis of the rating so warrant. Incurrence of additional debt by us, including, if the pending acquisition of Rite Aid is completed, outstanding Rite Aid indebtedness we acquire upon closing and any additional debt we issue in connection with the financing of the transaction, could adversely affect our credit ratings. Any disruptions or turmoil in the capital markets or any downgrade of our credit ratings could adversely affect our cost of funds, liquidity, competitive position and access to capital markets, which could materially and adversely affect our business operations, financial condition, and results of operations.As a holding company, Walgreens Boots Alliance is dependent on funding from its operating subsidiaries to pay dividends and other obligations.Walgreens Boots Alliance is a holding company with no business operations of its own. Its only significant asset is the outstanding capital stock of its subsidiaries. As a result, it is dependent on funding from its subsidiaries, including Walgreens and Alliance Boots, to meet its obligations. Additionally, Walgreens Boots Alliances subsidiaries may be restricted in their ability to pay cash dividends or to make other distributions to Walgreens Boots Alliance, which may limit the payment of cash dividends or other distributions to the holders of Walgreens Boots Alliance common stock. Credit facilities and other debt obligations of Walgreens Boots Alliance, as well as statutory provisions, may further limit the ability of Walgreens Boots Alliance and its subsidiaries to pay dividends.Our quarterly results may fluctuate significantly.Our operating results have historically varied on a quarterly basis and may continue to fluctuate significantly in the future. Factors that may affect our quarterly operating results, some of which are beyond the control of management, include, but are not limited to, seasonality; the timing of the introduction of new generic and brand name prescription drugs; inflation, including with respect to generic drug procurement costs; the timing and severity of the cough, cold and flu season; changes in payer reimbursement rates and terms; fluctuations in inventory, energy, transportation, labor, healthcare and other costs; significant acquisitions, dispositions, joint ventures and other strategic initiatives; asset impairments; the relative magnitude of our LIFO provision in any particular quarter; fluctuations in the value of our warrants to acquire AmerisourceBergen common stock; foreign currency fluctuations; prolonged severe weather in key markets; and many of the other risk factors discussed herein. Accordingly, we believe that quarter-to-quarter comparisons of our operating results are not necessarily meaningful and investors should not rely on the results of any particular quarter as an indication of our future performance.- 18 -Our businesses are seasonal in nature, and adverse events during the holiday and cough, cold and flu seasons could adversely impact our operating results.Our businesses are seasonal in nature, with the second fiscal quarter (December, January and February) typically generating a higher proportion of retail sales and earnings than other fiscal quarters. We purchase significant amounts of seasonal inventory in anticipation of the holiday season. Adverse events, such as deteriorating economic conditions, higher unemployment, higher gas prices, public transportation disruptions, or unanticipated adverse weather, could result in lower-than-planned sales during key selling seasons. For example, frequent or unusually heavy snowfall, ice storms, rainstorms, windstorms or other extreme weather conditions over a prolonged period could make it difficult for our customers to travel to our stores and increase our snow removal and other costs. This could lead to lower sales or to unanticipated markdowns, negatively impacting our financial condition and results of operations. In addition, both prescription and non-prescription drug sales are affected by the timing and severity of the cough, cold and flu season, which can vary considerably from year to year.We could be adversely impacted by changes in accounting standards and subjective assumptions, estimates and judgments by management related to complex accounting matters.Generally accepted accounting principles and related accounting pronouncements, implementation guidelines and interpretations with regard to a wide range of matters that are relevant to our businesses, including, but not limited to, revenue recognition, asset impairment, impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets, inventories, vendor rebates and other vendor consideration, lease obligations, self-insurance liabilities, tax matters, unclaimed property laws and litigation and other contingent liabilities are highly complex and involve many subjective assumptions, estimates and judgments. Changes in these rules or their interpretation or changes in underlying assumptions, estimates or judgments could significantly change our reported or expected financial performance or financial condition. For example, changes in accounting standards and the application of existing accounting standards particularly related to the measurement of fair value as compared to carrying value for the Companys reporting units, including goodwill, intangible assets and investments in equity interests, including investments held by our equity method investees, may have an adverse effect on the Companys financial condition and results of operations. Factors that could lead to impairment of goodwill and intangible assets include significant adverse changes in the business climate and declines in the financial condition of a reporting unit. Factors that could lead to impairment of investments in equity interests of the companies in which we invested or the investments held by those companies include a prolonged period of decline in their operating performance or adverse changes in the economic, regulatory and legal environments of the countries they operate in. New accounting guidance also may require systems and other changes that could increase our operating costs and/or change our financial statements. For example, implementing future accounting guidance related to leases, revenue and other areas impacted by the current convergence project between the Financial Accounting Standards Board and the International Accounting Standards Board could require us to make significant changes to our lease management system or other accounting systems, and could result in adverse changes to our financial statements.We have a substantial amount of goodwill and other intangible assets which could, in the future, become impaired and result in material non-cash charges to our results of operations.As of August 31, 2015, we had $28.7 billion of goodwill and other intangible assets (based on the preliminary purchase accounting for the Alliance Boots acquisition), a significant increase over the $3.5 billion of goodwill and other intangible assets we had as of August 31, 2014. We accounted for the Second Step Transaction using the purchase method of accounting in accordance with GAAP, with the purchase price paid allocated to recognize the acquired assets and liabilities at their fair value. At least annually, or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate a potential impairment in the carrying value as defined by GAAP, we will evaluate this goodwill and other intangible assets for impairment by first assessing qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances leads to a determination that it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying amount. Estimated fair values could change if, for example, there are changes in the business climate, unanticipated changes in the competitive environment, adverse legal or regulatory actions or developments, changes in capital structure, cost of debt, interest rates, capital expenditure levels, operating cash flows, or market capitalization. Because of the significance of our goodwill and intangible assets, any future impairment of these assets could require material non-cash charges to our results of operations, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.We are exposed to risks related to litigation and other legal proceedings.We operate in a highly regulated and litigious environment. We are involved in legal proceedings and subject to investigations, inspections, audits, inquiries and similar actions by governmental authorities arising in the course of our businesses, including those contained in Note 13, Commitments and Contingencies to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K. Legal proceedings, in general, and securities and class action litigation, in particular, can be expensive and disruptive. Some of these suits may purport or may be determined to be class actions and/or involve parties seeking large and/or indeterminate amounts, including punitive or exemplary damages, and may remain unresolved for several years. From time to time, we are also involved in legal proceedings as a plaintiff involving antitrust, tax, contract, intellectual property and other matters. We cannot predict with certainty the outcomes of these legal proceedings and other contingencies, and the costs incurred in litigation can be substantial, regardless of the outcome. Substantial unanticipated verdicts, fines and rulings do sometimes occur. As a result, we could from time to time incur judgments, enter into settlements or revise our expectations regarding the outcome of certain matters, and such developments could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in the period in which the amounts are accrued and/or our cash flows in the period in which the amounts are paid. The outcome of some of these legal proceedings and other contingencies could require us to take, or refrain from taking, actions which could negatively affect our operations. Additionally, defending against these lawsuits and proceedings may involve significant expense and diversion of managements attention and resources.- 19 -We could be adversely affected by violations of anti-bribery, anti-corruption and/or international trade laws.We are subject to laws concerning our business operations and marketing activities in foreign countries where we conduct business. For example, we are subject to the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (the FCPA), U.S. export control and trade sanction laws, and similar anti-corruption and international trade laws in certain foreign countries, such as the U.K. Bribery Act, any violation of which could create substantial liability for us and also harm our reputation. The FCPA generally prohibits U.S. companies and their officers, directors, employees, and intermediaries from making improper payments to foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business abroad or otherwise obtaining favorable treatment. The FCPA also requires that U.S. public companies maintain books and records that fairly and accurately reflect transactions and maintain an adequate system of internal accounting controls. If we are found to have violated the FCPA, or any other anti-bribery, anti-corruption or international trade laws, we may face sanctions including civil and criminal fines, disgorgement of profits, and suspension or debarment of our ability to contract with governmental agencies or receive export licenses. In addition, new initiatives may be proposed from time to time that impact the trading conditions in certain countries or regions, and may include retaliatory duties or trade sanctions which, if enacted, could adversely impact our trading relationships with vendors or other parties in such locations and have a material adverse effect on our operations. From time to time, we may face audits or investigations by one or more domestic or foreign governmental agencies relating to our international business activities, compliance with which could be costly and time-consuming, and could divert our management and key personnel from our business operations. An adverse outcome under any such investigation or audit could subject us to fines or other penalties, which could materially and adversely affect our business operations, financial condition, and results of operations.We could be subject to adverse changes in tax laws, regulations and interpretations or challenges to our tax positions.We are a large corporation with operations in the United States and numerous other jurisdictions around the world. As such, we are subject to tax laws and regulations of the United States federal, state and local governments as well as various foreign jurisdictions. We compute our income tax provision based on enacted tax rates in the jurisdictions in which we operate. As the tax rates vary among jurisdictions, a change in earnings attributable to the various jurisdictions in which we operate could result in an unfavorable change in our overall tax provision. From time to time, legislative initiatives are proposed that could adversely affect our tax positions, effective tax rate, tax payments or financial condition. In addition, tax laws are complex and subject to varying interpretations. Any change in enacted tax laws, rules or regulatory or judicial interpretations, any adverse outcome in connection with tax audits in any jurisdiction or any change in the pronouncements relating to accounting for income taxes could adversely affect our effective tax rate, tax payments and results of operations.Our insurance programs may expose us to unexpected costs.We use a combination of insurance and self-insurance to provide for potential liability for workers compensation; automobile and general liability; property, director and officers liability; and employee healthcare benefits. Provisions for losses related to self-insured risks generally are based upon actuarially determined estimates. Any actuarial projection of losses is subject to a high degree of variability. Changes in legal claims, trends and interpretations, variability in inflation rates, changes in the nature and method of claims settlement, benefit level changes due to changes in applicable laws, insolvency of insurance carriers, and changes in discount rates could all materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.We could be adversely impacted by changes in assumptions used in calculating pension assets and liabilities.We operate certain defined benefit pension plans in the United Kingdom, which were closed to new entrants in 2010. The valuation of the pension plans assets and liabilities depends in part on assumptions, which are primarily based on the financial markets as well as longevity and employee retention rates. This valuation is particularly sensitive to material changes in the value of equity, bond and other investments held by the pension plans, changes in the corporate bond yields which are used in the measurement of the liabilities, changes in market expectations for long-term price inflation, and new evidence on projected longevity rates. Funding requirements and the impact on the statement of earnings relating to these pension plans are also influenced by these factors. Adverse changes in the assumptions used to calculate the value of pension assets and liabilities, including lower than expected pension fund investment returns and/or increased life expectancy of plan participants, or regulatory change could require us to increase the funding of its defined benefit pension plans or incur higher expenses, which would adversely impact our results of operations and financial position.- 20 -Certain stockholders may have significant voting influence over matters requiring stockholder approval.As of August 31, 2015, affiliates of Stefano Pessina, our Executive Vice Chairman and Chief Executive Officer (the SP Investors), and affiliates of Kohlberg Kravis Roberts  Co. L.P. (KKR, and together with certain of its affiliates, the KKR Investors) together had sole or shared voting power, directly or indirectly, over an aggregate of approximately 20.2% of our outstanding common stock, based on filings by such persons with the SEC. This total includes the approximately 12.8% of our outstanding common stock (as of August 31, 2015) held by Sprint Acquisitions Holdings Limited (f/k/a AB Acquisitions Holdings Limited) (Sprint Acquisitions), which is jointly controlled by Mr. Pessina (indirectly through controlled entities) and the KKR Investors, which could be distributed to the various shareholders of Sprint Acquisitions (including the SP Investors and the KKR Investors) in fiscal 2016 as described below. The SP Investors and the KKR Investors have agreed to, for so long as the SP Investors and the KKR Investors (as applicable) have the right to designate a nominee for election to the Board, to vote all of their shares of common stock in accordance with the Boards recommendation on matters submitted to a vote of the Companys stockholders (including with respect to the election of directors). Whether or not subject to these voting provisions, the SP Investors and/or the KKR Investors significant interest in our common stock potentially could determine the outcome of matters submitted to a vote by our stockholders. The influence of the SP Investors and/or the KKR Investors could result in our taking actions that other stockholders do not support or failing to take actions that other stockholders support. As a result, the market price of our common stock could be adversely affected.Shares issued to Alliance Boots stockholders in connection with our strategic combination with Alliance Boots are or soon will be eligible for future sale.In connection with our strategic combination with Alliance Boots, we issued a total of approximately 227.7 million shares of our common stock to former Alliance Boots shareholders. These shares represented approximately 20.9% of our outstanding shares as of August 31, 2015. We also entered into, on August 2, 2012, a shareholders agreement (the Company Shareholders Agreement) with certain of the SP Investors and the KKR Investors that imposed certain contractual restrictions that generally prohibited them from transferring these shares of our common stock for specified time periods. These transfer restrictions have now lapsed. However, unless the SP Investors and the KKR Investors have elected to put certain guarantees in place, the Purchase and Option Agreement prohibits Sprint Acquisitions from distributing more than 10% of the shares of our common stock it received on completion of the Second Step Transaction to its investors until December 31, 2015. Accordingly, subject to these provisions of the Purchase and Option Agreement and certain obligations pursuant to the Company Shareholders Agreement, these shares may now be sold pursuant to Rule 144 under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act), depending on the holding period and subject to restrictions in the case of shares held by persons deemed to be our affiliates. The Company Shareholders Agreement also contains registration rights that would obligate us, in certain instances, to file future registration statements under the Securities Act covering resales of these shares or to permit a piggyback on a future registration statement. A sale, or the perception that a sale may occur, of a substantial number of shares of our common stock could adversely impact the market price of our common stock.Conflicts of interest, or the appearance of conflicts of interest, may arise because certain of our directors and officers are also owners or directors of our largest stockholder.As of August 31, 2015, Sprint Acquisitions was the holder of approximately 12.8% of our outstanding common stock. Sprint Acquisitions is jointly controlled by Stefano Pessina (indirectly through controlled entities) and the KKR Investors. Mr. Pessina is our Executive Vice Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, and Mr. Dominic Murphy is both a partner of KKR and one of our directors. Additionally, each of Marco Pagni, our Executive Vice President, Global Chief Legal and Administrative Officer, and Ornella Barra, our Executive Vice President, President and Chief Executive, Global Wholesale and International Retail, serves as a director of Sprint Acquisitions and/or its affiliates. This overlap could create, or appear to create, potential conflicts of interest, when our interests diverge with those of Sprint Acquisitions and/or its affiliates. For example, potential conflicts of interest could arise if a dispute were to arise between the Company and Sprint Acquisitions in connection with indemnification or other provisions of the Purchase and Option Agreement or the Company Shareholders Agreement. Potential conflicts of interest could also arise in connection with any current or future arrangements between the Company and Sprint Acquisitions or any of their respective affiliates. While our contractual arrangements place restrictions on the parties conduct in certain situations, and related party transactions are subject to independent review and approval in accordance with our related party transaction approval procedures and applicable law, the potential for a conflict of interest exists and such persons may have conflicts of interest, or the appearance of conflicts of interest, with respect to matters involving or affecting both companies.- 21 -Our certificate of incorporation and bylaws, Delaware law and/or our agreements with certain stockholders may impede the ability of our stockholders to make changes to our Board or impede a takeover.Certain provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws, as well as provisions of the Delaware General Corporation Law (the DGCL), could make it difficult for stockholders to change the composition of the Board or discourage, delay, or prevent a merger, consolidation, or acquisitions that stockholders may otherwise consider favorable. These provisions include the authorization of the issuance of blank check preferred stock that could be issued by the Board, limitations on the ability of stockholders to call special meetings, and advance notice requirements for nomination for election to the Board or for proposing matters that can be acted upon by stockholders at stockholder meetings. We are also subject to the provisions of Section 203 of the DGCL, which prohibits us, except under specified circumstances, from engaging in any mergers, significant sales of stock or assets, or business combinations with any stockholder or group of stockholders who own 15% or more of our common stock.Under the Company Shareholders Agreement, each of the SP Investors and the KKR Investors, respectively, is entitled to designate one nominee to the Board (currently Stefano Pessina for the SP Investors and Dominic Murphy for the KKR Investors) for so long as the SP Investors and the KKR Investors, respectively, continue to meet certain beneficial ownership thresholds and subject to certain other conditions. Pursuant to the Company Shareholders Agreement, the SP Investors and the KKR Investors have agreed that, for so long as each has the right to designate a nominee to the Board, they will vote all of their shares of common stock in accordance with the Boards recommendation on matters submitted to a vote of our stockholders (including with respect to the election of directors).In addition, pursuant to an agreement (the Nomination and Support Agreement) with JANA Partners LLC (JANA) whereby, among other things, Barry Rosenstein of JANA was appointed to the Board, JANA and its affiliates and controlled associates are subject to certain standstill restrictions until the date that is 15 days after Mr. Rosenstein is no longer a member of the Board (subject to certain conditions and limitations). These standstill restrictions include, among other things, that JANA and its affiliates and controlled associates will vote their shares in favor of all incumbent directors nominated by the Board and in accordance with the recommendations of the Board on other matters, other than certain matters specified in the Nomination and Support Agreement.While these provisions do not make us immune from takeovers or changes in the composition of the Board, and are intended to protect our stockholders from, among other things, coercive or otherwise unfair tactics, these provisions could have the effect of making it difficult for stockholders to change the composition of the Board or discouraging, delaying, or preventing a merger, consolidation, or acquisitions that stockholders may otherwise consider favorable.

Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read together with the financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere herein. This discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results may differ materially from those discussed in forward-looking statements. Factors that might cause a difference include, but are not limited to, those discussed under Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements below and in Risk Factors in Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K. References herein to the Company, we, us, or our refer to Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. and its subsidiaries from and after the effective time of the Reorganization on December 31, 2014 and, prior to that time, to its predecessor Walgreen Co. and its subsidiaries, and in each case do not include unconsolidated partially-owned entities, except as otherwise indicated or the context otherwise requires.OVERVIEW On December 31, 2014, Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. became the successor of Walgreen Co. pursuant to a merger to effect a reorganization of Walgreens into a holding company structure, with Walgreens Boots Alliance becoming the parent holding company. Pursuant to the Reorganization, Walgreens became a wholly-owned subsidiary of Walgreens Boots Alliance, a Delaware corporation formed for purposes of the Reorganization, and each issued and outstanding share of Walgreens common stock was converted into one share of Walgreens Boots Alliance common stock. Walgreens Boots Alliance, as successor to Walgreens, replaced Walgreens as the publicly-held corporation.On December 31, 2014, following the completion of the Reorganization, Walgreens Boots Alliance completed the acquisition of the remaining 55% of Alliance Boots GmbH that Walgreens did not previously own in exchange for 3.133 billion ($4.874 billion) in cash and approximately 144.3 million shares of Walgreens Boots Alliance common stock pursuant to the Purchase and Option Agreement. Walgreens previously had acquired, on August 2, 2012, a 45% equity interest in Alliance Boots along with a call option to acquire the remaining 55% equity interest in Alliance Boots in exchange for $4.025 billion in cash and approximately 83.4 million shares of Walgreens common stock.Prior to the completion of the Second Step Transaction, we accounted for our 45% investment in Alliance Boots using the equity method of accounting. Investments accounted for under the equity method are recorded initially at cost and subsequently adjusted for our share of the net income or loss and cash contributions and distributions to or from these entities. Net income reported by Alliance Boots during this period was translated from British Pounds Sterling at the average rate for the period. Upon completion of the Second Step Transaction, Alliance Boots became a consolidated subsidiary and ceased being accounted for under the equity method. For financial reporting and accounting purposes, Walgreens Boots Alliance was the acquirer of Alliance Boots. The consolidated financial statements (and other data, such as prescriptions filled) reflect the results of operations and financial position of Walgreens and its subsidiaries for periods prior to December 31, 2014 and of Walgreens Boots Alliance and its subsidiaries for periods from and after the effective time of the Reorganization on December 31, 2014.RECENT DEVELOPMENT On October 27, 2015, the Company entered into the Merger Agreement with Rite Aid, pursuant to which the Company agreed to acquire Rite Aid, a drugstore chain in the United States with 4,561 stores in 31 states and the District of Columbia as of August 29, 2015. On the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement, Rite Aid will become a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company and Rite Aid stockholders will be entitled to receive $9.00 in cash for each outstanding share of Rite Aid common stock, for a total enterprise value of approximately $17.2 billion, including acquired net debt. The transaction is expected to close in the second half of calendar 2016, subject to Rite Aid stockholder approval, regulatory approvals and other customary closing conditions.We intend to finance the transaction through a combination of cash on hand and debt financing. Concurrently with the signing of the Merger Agreement, the Company entered into a bridge facility commitment letter (the \"Commitment Letter\"), dated October 27, 2015, with UBS Securities LLC and UBS AG, Stamford Branch for a $12.8 billion senior unsecured bridge facility (the Facility). The Facility, if funded, will mature 364 days after the initial borrowings; provided that the Company can extend up to $3.0 billion of the Facility for an additional 90 day period if desired. The interest rate applicable to borrowings under the Facility will be LIBOR or the applicable base rate plus a margin. The financing commitments of the lenders are subject to certain customary conditions set forth in the Commitment Letter. We expect to obtain permanent financing for the transaction prior to the closing date, which would replace the Facility.COMPARABILITY As a result of the completion of the Second Step Transaction on December 31, 2014, there are a number of items that affect comparability for the Company. Historically, Walgreens operations were within one reportable segment that included the results of the Retail Pharmacy USA division and corporate costs, along with the full consolidated results of WBAD and equity earnings from Alliance Boots (on a three-month reporting lag). Upon completion of the Second Step Transaction, Alliance Boots became a consolidated subsidiary and the Company eliminated the three-month reporting lag. Prior period results have been recast to reflect the elimination of the reporting lag. Additionally, following the completion of the Reorganization and the Second Step Transaction on December 31, 2014, the Company now reports results in three segments. Segmental reporting includes the allocation of synergy benefits, including WBADs results, and the combined corporate costs for periods subsequent to December 31, 2014. The Company has determined that it is impracticable to allocate historical results to the current segmental presentation.The completion of the Second Step Transaction on December 31, 2014 also means that results for fiscal 2015 include the results of Alliance Boots for eight months (January through August 2015) on a fully consolidated basis and four months (September through December 2014) as equity income from Walgreens pre-closing 45 percent interest.The Companys balance sheet reflects the full consolidation of Alliance Boots assets and liabilities as a result of the close of the combination on December 31, 2014. The Companys purchase accounting remains preliminary as contemplated by GAAP and, as a result, there may be upon further review future changes to the value, as well as allocation, of the acquired assets and liabilities, associated amortization expense, goodwill and the gain on the previously held equity interest. These changes may be material.Year-over-year comparisons of results require consideration of the foregoing factors and are not directly comparable.In addition, the Companys sales are affected by a number of factors including, among others, our sales performance during holiday periods and during the cough, cold and flu season, significant weather conditions, timing of our own or competitor discount programs and pricing actions, levels of reimbursement from governmental agencies and other third party health providers and general economic conditions in the markets in which we operate.- 29 -AMERISOURCEBERGEN CORPORATION RELATIONSHIP On March 19, 2013, Walgreens, Alliance Boots and AmerisourceBergen announced various agreements and arrangements, including a ten-year pharmaceutical distribution agreement between Walgreens and AmerisourceBergen pursuant to which branded and generic pharmaceutical products are sourced from AmerisourceBergen in the U.S.; an agreement which provides AmerisourceBergen the ability to access generics and related pharmaceutical products through WBAD, a global sourcing enterprise formed by Walgreens and Alliance Boots; and agreements and arrangements pursuant to which we have the right, but not the obligation, to purchase a minority equity position in AmerisourceBergen and gain associated representation on AmerisourceBergens Board of Directors in certain circumstances. In addition to the information in this report, please refer to our Current Report on Form 8-K filed on March 20, 2013, for more detailed information regarding these agreements and arrangements. At August 31, 2015, the Company owned approximately 5.2% of the outstanding common shares in AmerisourceBergen and had designated one member of AmerisourceBergens Board of Directors.RESTRUCTURING PROGRAMS On April 8, 2015, the Board of Directors approved a plan to implement a new restructuring program (the Cost Transformation Program) as part of an initiative to reduce costs and increase operating efficiencies. The Cost Transformation Program implements and builds on the planned three-year, $1.0 billion cost-reduction initiative previously announced by Walgreens on August 6, 2014 and includes a number of elements designed to help achieve profitable growth through increased cost efficiencies. We have identified additional opportunities for cost savings that increase the total expected cost savings of the Cost Transformation Program by $500 million to a projected $1.5 billion by the end of fiscal 2017. Significant areas of focus include plans to close approximately 200 stores across the U.S.; reorganize divisional and field operations; drive operating efficiencies; and streamline information technology and other functions. The actions under the Cost Transformation Program focus primarily on our Retail Pharmacy USA division, and are expected to be substantially completed by the end of fiscal 2017.We currently estimate that we will recognize cumulative pre-tax charges to our GAAP financial results of between $1.6 billion and $1.8 billion, including costs associated with lease obligations and other real estate payments, asset impairments and employee termination and other business transition and exit costs. We expect to incur pre-tax charges of between $525 million and $600 million for real estate costs, including lease obligations (net of estimated sublease income), between $650 million and $725 million for asset impairment charges relating primarily to asset write-offs from store closures, information technology, inventory and other non-operational real estate asset write-offs, and between $425 million and $475 million for employee severance and other business transition and exit costs. We estimate that approximately 60% of the cumulative pre-tax charges will result in immediate or future cash expenditures, primarily related to lease and other real estate payments and employee separation costs.We incurred pre-tax charges of $542 million ($223 million related to asset impairment charges, $202 million in real estate costs and $117 million in severance and other business transition and exit costs) related to the Cost Transformation Program in fiscal 2015. The majority of the charges incurred in fiscal 2015 related to activities within the Retail Pharmacy USA division but also included activities within Retail Pharmacy International. All charges related to the Cost Transformation Program have been recorded within selling, general and administrative expenses. We closed 84 stores in the United States related to the Cost Transformation Program in fiscal 2015. On March 24, 2014, the Board of Directors approved a plan to close underperforming stores in efforts to optimize and focus resources within our Retail Pharmacy USA operations in a manner intended to increase shareholder value. As of August 31, 2015, we have closed 68 locations, one of which was closed in fiscal 2015. In fiscal 2015, we incurred total pre-tax charges related to this plan of $17 million primarily related to lease termination costs. In fiscal 2014, we incurred pre-tax charges of $209 million ($137 million from lease termination costs, $71 million from asset impairments and $1 million of other charges). All charges related to this plan have been recorded within selling, general and administrative expenses. We expect to incur no additional costs related to this plan. - 30 -Restructuring costs by segment were as follows (in millions):##TABLE_START   Retail Pharmacy       USA  International  Pharmaceutical Wholesale  Consolidated Fiscal 2015        Asset impairments $  $  $-  $ Real estate costs  219   -   -   219 Severance and other business transition and exit costs  105   12   -   117 Total restructuring costs  540  $  $-  $                  Fiscal 2014                Real estate costs $  $-  $-  $ Asset impairments  71   -   -   71 Severance and other business transition and exit costs  1   -   -   1 Total restructuring costs $  $-  $-  $ ##TABLE_END As the program is implemented, the restructuring charges will be recognized as the costs are incurred over time in accordance with GAAP.

All periods have been recast to reflect the removal of the three-month reporting lag applied to reporting equity earnings in Alliance Boots prior to December 31, 2014. Additionally, as a result of the completion of the Second Step Transaction, Alliance Boots became a consolidated subsidiary and the Company ceased recording equity earnings in Alliance Boots on December 31, 2014. As a result, fiscal 2015 includes the results of Alliance Boots for eight months (January through August 2015) on a fully consolidated basis and four months (September through December 2014) as equity earnings in Alliance Boots reflecting Walgreens pre-closing 45 percent interest.##TABLE_START   (in millions, except per share amounts)   2015  2014  2013 Net sales $103,444  $76,392  $72,217 Gross Profit  26,924   21,569   21,119 Selling, general and administrative expenses  22,571   17,992   17,543 Operating Income  4,668   4,194   4,092 Adjusted Operating Income (Non-GAAP measure) (1)   6,157   4,866   4,828 Earnings Before Interest and Income Tax Provision  5,916   3,713   4,212 Net Earnings Attributable to Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc.  4,220   1,932   2,548 Adjusted Net Earnings Attributable to Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc.

For fiscal 2015, the full consolidation of Alliance Boots operations increased our net sales by 29.4%, gross profit by 23.6%, selling general and administrative expenses by 24.1 % and operating income by 18.5%, each as compared to fiscal 2014.Net earnings attributable to Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. for fiscal 2015 were $4.2 billion, or $4.00 per diluted share as compared to $1.9 billion, or $2.00 per diluted share in fiscal 2014. The increase in net earnings per diluted share for fiscal 2015 as compared to fiscal 2014, was primarily attributable to the full consolidation of Alliance Boots operations from January through August 2015, a gain on our 45% previously held equity interest in Alliance Boots, increased sales in our Retail Pharmacy USA division, increased income from our warrants to acquire AmerisourceBergen common stock and a lower effective income tax rate. These increases were partially offset by lower Retail Pharmacy USA gross margins and a higher interest expense.As a result of acquiring the remaining 55% interest in Alliance Boots on December 31, 2014, our previously held 45% interest was remeasured to fair value, resulting in a gain of $563 million in fiscal 2015. The fair value of the previously held equity interest in Alliance Boots was determined using the income approach methodology. The fair value measurement of the previously held equity interest is based on significant inputs not observable in the market. The fair value estimates for the previously held equity interest are based on (a) projected discounted cash flows, (b) historical and projected financial information, and (c) synergies including cost savings, as relevant, that market participants would consider when estimating the fair value of the previously held equity interest in Alliance Boots. See Note 8, Acquisitions, to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.Other income (expense) for fiscal 2015 was income of $685 million as compared to expense of $481 million in fiscal 2014. The change in fair value of our AmerisourceBergen warrants resulted in recording income of $759 million and $366 million in fiscal 2015 and 2014, respectively. The increase in fair value was primarily attributed to the change in the price of AmerisourceBergens common stock. In addition, we recorded $20 million and $19 million in fiscal 2015 and 2014, respectively, of other income relating to the amortization of the deferred credit associated with the initial value of the Walgreens warrants. We have also recorded a loss of $94 million in fiscal 2015 on derivative contracts that were not designated as accounting hedges. The losses primarily relate to foreign currency forward contracts entered into in consideration of the delivery of foreign cash consideration related to the Second Step Transaction. Fiscal 2014 results also included a loss of $866 million related to the Alliance Boots call option. Upon the amendment and immediate exercise of the call option to acquire the remaining 55% ownership of Alliance Boots, we were required to compare the fair value of the amended option with the book value of the original option. The fair value of the amended option was estimated to be zero based on its valuation as a financial instrument without regard for its strategic value. The reduction in value was primarily due to the shorter duration of the amended option and the appreciation since the original valuation in the price of Walgreens stock used as partial consideration for the purchase of the remaining 55% ownership interest in Alliance Boots. - 32 -Interest was a net expense of $605 million and $156 million in fiscal 2015 and 2014, respectively. The increase in fiscal 2015 interest expense is primarily due to the notes we issued to fund a portion of the cash consideration payable in connection with the Second Step Transaction and to subsequently refinance substantially all of Alliance Boots outstanding borrowings following completion of the Second Step Transaction. Additionally, in fiscal 2015 we repaid a portion of our long-term debt in advance of its maturity resulting in additional net interest expense of $99 million.The effective tax rate for fiscal 2015 and 2014 was 19.9% and 42.9%, respectively. The decrease in the fiscal 2015 effective tax rate as compared to fiscal 2014 is primarily attributable to recording discrete tax benefits related to previously unrecognized capital loss deferred tax assets as a result of recognizing capital gain income from fiscal 2015 and anticipated future period sale-leaseback transactions. In addition, as a result of our acquisition of the remaining 55% interest in Alliance Boots that we did not previously own, our annual effective tax rate decreased due to incremental foreign source income taxed at lower rates and additional favorable permanent book-tax differences. Also as a result of the acquisition, we recognized a non-recurring tax benefit that also lowered our annual effective tax rate. In addition, we recognized other, net discrete tax benefits in the current fiscal year.Walgreens Boots Alliance Adjusted Net Earnings Per Diluted Share (Non-GAAP measure) Adjusted net earnings per diluted share for fiscal 2015 was $3.88, an increase of 18.3% from $3.28 in fiscal 2014. The increase in adjusted net earnings per diluted share in fiscal 2015 was primarily attributable to the full consolidation of Alliance Boots operations from January through August 2015, increased sales and lower selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales in our Retail Pharmacy USA division and a lower effective income tax rate. These increases were partially offset by lower Retail Pharmacy USA gross margins and a higher interest expense. See --Non-GAAP Measures below for a reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP measure.Fiscal 2014 compared to fiscal 2013 Net earnings attributable to Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. for fiscal 2014 were $1.9 billion or $2.00 per diluted share as compared to $2.5 billion, or $2.67 per diluted share in fiscal 2013. The decrease in fiscal 2014 net earnings per diluted share as compared to fiscal 2013 was primarily attributable to lower gross margins in our Retail Pharmacy USA division, a loss related to the Alliance Boots call option and a higher effective tax rate, partially offset by higher sales, lower selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales, increased equity earnings in Alliance Boots and increased gains on fair market value adjustments related to our AmerisourceBergen warrants.Other income (expense) for the fiscal 2014 was expense of $481 million as compared to income of $120 million in fiscal 2013. Fiscal 2014 results include a loss of $866 million related to the Alliance Boots call option. The change in fair value of our AmerisourceBergen warrants resulted in recording income of $366 million and $111 million in fiscal 2014 and 2013, respectively. The increase in fair value was primarily attributed to the change in the price of AmerisourceBergens common stock. In addition, we recorded $19 million and $9 million in fiscal 2014 and 2013, respectively, of other income relating to the amortization of the deferred credit associated with the initial value of the Walgreens warrants.Interest was a net expense of $156 million and $165 million in fiscal 2014 and 2013, respectively. The decrease in fiscal 2014 interest expense as compared to fiscal 2013 was due to the repayment of notes that matured in fiscal 2014 partially offset by higher interest charges related to incremental capital and finance lease obligations.The effective tax rate for fiscal 2014 and 2013 was 42.9% and 37.0%, respectively. The increase in the fiscal 2014 effective tax rate as compared to fiscal 2013 was primarily attributable to the loss associated with the Companys option to purchase the remaining equity interest in Alliance Boots, which did not generate a tax benefit in fiscal 2014, partially offset by the favorable impact of additional foreign source income taxed at lower rates.Walgreens Boots Alliance Adjusted Net Earnings Per Diluted Share (Non-GAAP measure) Adjusted net earnings per diluted share for fiscal 2014 were $3.28 compared to $3.25 in fiscal 2013. The increase in adjusted net earnings per diluted share for the fiscal 2014 as compared to fiscal 2013 was primarily attributed to higher sales, lower selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales, and increased equity earnings in Alliance Boots, partially offset by lower gross margins in our Retail Pharmacy USA division. See --Non-GAAP Measures below for a reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP measure.- 33 -RESULTS OF OPERATIONS BY SEGMENT Retail Pharmacy USAAll periods have been recasted for removal of the three-month reporting lag previously applied to reporting equity earnings in Alliance Boots. Additionally, as a result of the completion of the Second Step Transaction, the Company ceased recording equity earnings in Alliance Boots as of December 31, 2014. As such, fiscal 2015 includes equity earnings in Alliance Boots from September 1, 2014 through December 31, 2014.##TABLE_START   (in millions, except location amounts)   2015  2014  2013 Total Sales $80,974  $76,392  $72,217 Gross Profit  21,822   21,569   21,119 Selling, general and administrative expenses  18,247   17,992   17,543 Operating Income  3,890   4,194   4,092 Adjusted Operating Income (Non-GAAP measure) (1)   5,098   4,866   4,828 Number of Prescriptions (2)   723   699   683 30 Day Equivalent Prescriptions (2)(3)   894   856   821 Number of Locations at period end (4)   8,182   8,309   8,582 ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START   Percentage Increases/(Decreases)   2015  2014  2013 Total Sales  6.0   5.8   0.8 Gross Profit  1.2   2.1   3.8 Selling, general and administrative expenses  1.4   2.6   3.9 Operating Income  (7.2)  2.5   18.1 Adjusted Operating Income (Non-GAAP measure) (1)   4.8   0.8   17.8 Comparable Drugstore Sales  6.4   4.9   (1.3)Pharmacy Sales  8.2   7.9   0.4 Comparable Pharmacy Sales  9.3   6.8   (1.7)Retail Sales  1.9   2.1   1.5 Comparable Retail Sales  1.5   2.0   (0.7)Comparable Number of Prescriptions (2)   3.5   1.8   1.1 Comparable 30 Day Equivalent Prescriptions (2)(3)   4.6   3.9   3.2 ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START   Percent to Total Sales   2015  2014  2013 Gross Margin  26.9   28.2   29.3 Selling, general and administrative expenses  22.5   23.6   24.3 ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START (1) See --Non-GAAP Measures below for a reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP measure and related disclosures. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START (2) Includes immunizations. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START (3) Includes the adjustment to convert prescriptions greater than 84 days to the equivalent of three 30-day prescriptions. This adjustment reflects the fact that these prescriptions include approximately three times the amount of product days supplied compared to a normal prescription. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START (4) Locations in 2013 include worksite health and wellness centers, which were part of the Take Care Employer business in which we sold a majority interest in fiscal 2014. Locations in 2014 include infusion and respiratory service facilities in which we sold a majority interest in fiscal 2015. ##TABLE_END Sales fiscal 2015 compared to fiscal 2014 The Retail Pharmacy USA divisions total sales for fiscal 2015 increased by 6.0% to $81.0 billion. Total sales increased primarily due to higher comparable store sales, which were up 6.4% in fiscal 2015. Comparable drugstores are defined as those that have been open for at least twelve consecutive months without closure for seven or more consecutive days and without a major remodel or a natural disaster in the past twelve months. Relocated and acquired stores are not included as comparable stores for the first twelve months after the relocation or acquisition. We operated 8,182 locations (8,173 drugstores) as of August 31, 2015, compared to 8,309 locations (8,207 drugstores) a year earlier. Prior years locations included 91 infusion and respiratory services facilities in which we sold a majority interest in fiscal 2015.- 34 -Pharmacy sales increased by 8.2% in fiscal 2015 and represented 66.1% of the divisions total sales. In fiscal 2014, pharmacy sales were up 7.9% and represented 64.2% of the divisions total sales. Comparable pharmacy sales increased 9.3% in fiscal 2015 compared to an increase of 6.8% in fiscal 2014. The effect of generic drugs, which have a lower retail price, replacing brand name drugs reduced prescription sales by 1.8% in fiscal 2015 versus a reduction of 1.3% in fiscal 2014. The effect of generics on division total sales was a reduction of 1.0% in fiscal 2015 compared to a reduction of 0.7% for fiscal 2014. Third party sales, where reimbursement is received from managed care organizations, governmental agencies, employers or private insurers, were 96.8% of prescription sales for fiscal 2015 compared to 96.5% for fiscal 2014. The total number of prescriptions (including immunizations) filled in fiscal 2015 was approximately 723 million compared to 699 million in fiscal 2014. Prescriptions (including immunizations) adjusted to 30 day equivalents were 894 million in fiscal 2015 versus 856 million in fiscal 2014.Retail sales increased 1.9% in fiscal 2015 and were 33.9% of the divisions total sales. In comparison, fiscal 2014 retail sales increased 2.1% and comprised 35.8% of the divisions total sales. Comparable retail sales increased 1.5% in fiscal 2015 compared to an increase of 2.0% in fiscal 2014. The increase in comparable retail sales in fiscal 2015 as compared to fiscal 2014 was primarily attributed to an increase in basket size partially offset by lower customer traffic.Operating Income fiscal 2015 compared to fiscal 2014 Retail Pharmacy USA divisions operating income for fiscal 2015 decreased 7.2% to $3.9 billion. The decrease is primarily due to having equity earnings in Alliance Boots for four months in the current year versus twelve months in the comparable period and current year costs related to the Cost Transformation Program.Gross margin as a percent of total sales was 26.9% in fiscal 2015 compared to 28.2% in fiscal 2014. Pharmacy margins were negatively impacted in the current fiscal year by lower third-party reimbursements; an increase in Medicare Part D mix including the strategy to continue driving 90-day prescriptions at retail; and the mix of specialty drugs, which carry a lower margin percentage. The decrease in pharmacy margins was partially offset by additional brand-to-generic drug conversions compared with the prior fiscal year. Retail margins were positively impacted in fiscal 2015 primarily from the non-prescription drug, beauty and beverage and snack categories partially offset by the electronics category.Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of total sales were 22.5% in fiscal 2015 compared to 23.6% in fiscal 2014. As a percentage of total sales, expenses in fiscal 2015 were lower primarily due to store labor efficiencies partially offset by higher costs related to the Cost Transformation Program.Adjusted Operating Income (Non-GAAP measure) fiscal 2015 compared to fiscal 2014 Retail Pharmacy USA divisions adjusted operating income for fiscal 2015 increased 4.8% to $5.1 billion. The increase is primarily due to higher sales and lower selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales partially offset by having four months of equity earnings in Alliance Boots in fiscal 2015 versus twelve months in fiscal 2014 and lower gross margins. See --Non-GAAP Measures below for a reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP measure.Sales fiscal 2014 compared to fiscal 2013 The Retail Pharmacy USA divisions total sales for fiscal 2014 increased by 5.8% to $76.4 billion. Total sales increased from new stores, each of which includes an indeterminate amount of market-driven price changes, and higher comparable store sales. Sales in comparable drugstores were up 4.9% in fiscal 2014 compared to a decrease of 1.3% in fiscal 2013. We operated 8,309 locations (8,207 drugstores) as of August 31, 2014, compared to 8,582 locations (8,116 drugstores) at August 31, 2013. Included in fiscal 2013 locations were 371 worksite health and wellness centers, which were part of the Take Care Employer business in which we sold a majority interest in fiscal 2014.Pharmacy sales increased by 7.9% in fiscal 2014 and represented 64.2% of the divisions total sales. In fiscal 2013, pharmacy sales were up 0.4% and represented 62.9% of the divisions total sales. Comparable pharmacy sales were up 6.8% in fiscal 2014 compared to a decrease of 1.7% in fiscal 2013. The effect of generic drugs, which have a lower retail price, replacing brand name drugs reduced prescription sales by 1.3% in fiscal 2014 versus a reduction of 5.3% in fiscal 2013. The effect of generics on division total sales was a reduction of 0.7% in fiscal 2014 compared to a reduction of 3.0% for fiscal 2013. Third party sales, where reimbursement is received from managed care organizations, governmental agencies, employers or private insurers, were 96.5% of prescription sales for fiscal 2014 compared to 95.8% for fiscal 2013. The total number of prescriptions (including immunizations) filled in fiscal 2014 was approximately 699 million compared to 683 million in fiscal 2013. Prescriptions (including immunizations) adjusted to 30 day equivalents were 856 million in fiscal 2014 versus 821 million in fiscal 2013.- 35 -Retail sales increased 2.1% in fiscal 2014 and were 35.8% of the divisions total sales. In comparison, fiscal 2013 retail sales increased 1.5% and comprised 37.1% of the divisions total sales. Comparable retail sales increased 2.0% in fiscal 2014 compared to a decrease of 0.7% in fiscal 2013. The increase in comparable retail sales in fiscal 2014 as compared to fiscal 2013 was primarily attributed to an increase in basket size partially offset by lower customer traffic.Operating Income fiscal 2014 compared to fiscal 2013 Retail Pharmacy USA divisions operating income for fiscal 2014 was $4.2 billion, an increase of 2.5% compared to fiscal 2013. The increase is primarily due to higher sales and increased equity earnings in Alliance Boots, partially offset by lower gross margins.Gross margin as a percent of total sales was 28.2% in fiscal 2014, compared to 29.3% in fiscal 2013. Gross margin in fiscal 2014 was negatively impacted by lower retail pharmacy margins primarily from lower third-party reimbursement; the increase in Medicare Part D mix and the strategy to continue driving 90-day prescriptions at retail; fewer brand-to-generic drug conversions compared with the prior year period; generic drug inflation on a subset of generic drugs; and the mix of specialty drugs, which carry a lower margin percentage. Retail margins were negatively impacted in the photofinishing, non-prescription drug and convenience and fresh foods categories. Pharmacy and retail margin decreases were partially offset by purchasing synergies realized from WBAD and a lower provision for LIFO in fiscal 2014.Selling, general and administrative expenses were 23.6% of total sales in fiscal 2014, compared to 24.3% of total sales in fiscal 2013. As a percentage of total sales, expenses were lower primarily due to lower store compensation costs, store occupancy costs and headquarters costs, partially offset by costs related to our store optimization plan.Adjusted Operating Income (Non-GAAP measure) fiscal 2014 compared to fiscal 2013 Retail Pharmacy USA divisions adjusted operating income for fiscal 2014 was $4.9 billion, an increase of 0.8% compared to fiscal 2013. The increase is primarily due to higher sales and lower selling, general and administrative expenses as a percent of sales partially offset by lower gross margins.

Short-term investment objectives are primarily to minimize risk and maintain liquidity. To attain these objectives, investment limits are placed on the amount, type and issuer of securities. Investments are principally in U.S. Treasury market funds and AAA rated money market funds.Our long-term capital policy is to maintain a strong balance sheet and financial flexibility; reinvest in our core strategies; invest in strategic opportunities that reinforce our core strategies and meet return requirements; and return surplus cash flow to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases over the long term.Cash provided by operations and the issuance of debt are the principal sources of funds for expansion, investments, acquisitions, remodeling programs, dividends to shareholders and stock repurchases. Net cash provided by operating activities was $5.7 billion in fiscal 2015 compared to $3.9 billion in fiscal 2014 and $4.3 billion in fiscal 2013. The increase in fiscal 2015 cash provided by operating activities was primarily a result of higher net earnings as a result of the inclusion of Alliance Boots operations on a fully-consolidated basis from January to August and working capital improvements compared to the prior fiscal year.- 39 -Net cash used for investing activities was $4.3 billion in fiscal 2015 compared to $1.7 billion in fiscal 2014 and $2.0 billion in fiscal 2013. The acquisition of the remaining 55% of Alliance Boots that we did not previously own used $4.5 billion of cash in fiscal 2015. Other business acquisitions in fiscal 2015 were $371 million versus $344 million in fiscal 2014 and $630 million in fiscal 2013. Other business acquisitions in fiscal 2015 included Liz Earle Beauty Co. Ltd. in addition to other asset acquisitions, primarily pharmacy prescription files. Other business acquisitions in fiscal 2014 included the purchase of the U.S. regional drugstore chain Kerr Drug and affiliates and the purchase of pharmacy prescription files. Other business acquisitions in fiscal 2013 included the purchase of the regional drugstore chain USA Drug from Stephen L. LaFrance Holdings, Inc. and members of the LaFrance family, an 80% interest in Cystic Fibrosis Foundation Pharmacy, LLC, and the purchase of pharmacy prescription files.Additions to property, plant and equipment in fiscal 2015 were $1.3 billion compared to $1.1 billion in fiscal 2014 and $1.2 billion in fiscal 2013. Capital expenditures by reporting segment were as follows:##TABLE_START   2015  2014  2013 Retail Pharmacy USA $  $1,106  $1,212 Retail Pharmacy International (1)   249   -   - Pharmaceutical Wholesale (1)   51   -   - Total $1,251  $1,106  $1,212 ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START (1) Our Retail Pharmacy International and Pharmaceutical Wholesale segments were acquired as part of the Second Step Transaction in which we acquired the 55% of Alliance Boots that we did not already own on December 31, 2014. As a result of the timing of the acquisition, only eight months (January through August 2015) of capital expenditures have been reported.##TABLE_END Our Retail Pharmacy USA segment opened, relocated or acquired 133 locations in fiscal 2015 compared to 268 locations in fiscal 2014 and 350 locations in fiscal 2013. Fiscal 2014 acquisitions included Kerr Drug, which contributed 76 drugstore locations as well as a specialty pharmacy and a distribution center. Fiscal 2013 acquisitions included the acquisition of 141 USA Drug locations. Significant Retail Pharmacy International capital expenditures in fiscal 2015 primarily relate to investments in our stores and information technology projects. Pharmaceutical Wholesale capital expenditures in fiscal 2015 primarily relate to information technology projects.Additionally, investing activities for fiscal 2015 included proceeds related to sale-leaseback transactions and the sale of Walgreens Infusion Services of $867 million and $814 million, respectively. No AmerisourceBergen common stock was purchased in fiscal 2015 compared to $493 million in fiscal 2014 and $224 million in fiscal 2013.Net cash used by financing activities in fiscal 2015 was $915 million compared to $1.6 billion in fiscal 2014 and $1.5 billion in fiscal 2013. In fiscal 2015, we received proceeds from public offerings of $8.0 billion of U.S. dollar denominated debt, approximately $2.0 billion of Euro and Pound Sterling denominated debt and borrowed approximately $2.2 billion on a Pound Sterling denominated term loan (each as described below). The proceeds from these offerings and funds from the term loan were used to fund a portion of the cash consideration payable in connection with the Second Step Transaction, refinance substantially all of Alliance Boots outstanding borrowings following the completion of the Second Step Transaction and pay related fees and expenses. Additionally in fiscal 2015, we repaid $1.8 billion of notes prior to their stated maturity (as described below). We repurchased shares to support the needs of the employee stock plans totaling $500 million in fiscal 2015, compared to $705 million in fiscal 2014 and $615 million in fiscal 2013. Additionally, we purchased $726 million of stock related to the 2014 stock repurchase program in fiscal 2015. No purchases related to the 2014 stock repurchase program were made in fiscal 2014. Proceeds related to employee stock plans were $503 million in fiscal 2015, compared to $612 million in fiscal 2014 and $486 million in fiscal 2013. Cash dividends paid were $1.4 billion in fiscal 2015 compared to $1.2 billion and $1.0 billion in fiscal 2014 and 2013, respectively. The Company intends to continue to maintain a long-term dividend payout ratio target of approximately 30 to 35 percent of adjusted net earnings attributable to Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc.In August 2014, our Board of Directors authorized the 2014 stock repurchase program, which authorizes the repurchase of up to $3.0 billion of the Companys common stock prior to its expiration on August 31, 2016. We purchased 8.2 million shares under the 2014 stock repurchase program in fiscal 2015 at a cost of $726 million.We determine the timing and amount of repurchases based on our assessment of various factors including prevailing market conditions, alternate uses of capital, liquidity, the economic environment and other factors. Because the consideration payable to Rite Aid stockholders will be paid in cash, we plan to suspend activity under this program. The timing and amount of purchases under the program may change at any time and from time to time. We have repurchased, and may from time to time in the future repurchase, shares on the open market through Rule 10b-1 plans, which enable a company to repurchase shares at times when it otherwise might be precluded from doing so under insider trading laws.- 40 -We periodically borrow under our commercial paper program and may continue to borrow under it in future periods. There were no commercial paper borrowings outstanding at August 31, 2015 or 2014. We had average daily short-term borrowings of $82 million of commercial paper outstanding at a weighted average interest rate of 0.52% in fiscal 2015 as compared to average daily short-term borrowings of $4 million of commercial paper outstanding at a weighted average interest rate of 0.23% in fiscal 2014.On November 10, 2014, Walgreens Boots Alliance and Walgreens entered into a term loan credit agreement (the Term Loan Agreement) which provides us with the ability to borrow up to 1.45 billion on an unsecured basis. As of August 31, 2015, we have borrowed 1.45 billion ($2.2 billion at the August 31, 2015 spot rate of $1.54 to 1) under the Term Loan Agreement. Borrowings under the Term Loan Agreement bear interest at a fluctuating rate per annum equal to the reserve adjusted LIBOR plus an applicable margin based on our credit ratings.On November 10, 2014, Walgreens Boots Alliance and Walgreens entered into a five-year unsecured, multicurrency revolving credit agreement (the Revolving Credit Agreement), which replaced prior Walgreens agreements dated July 20, 2011 and July 23, 2012. The new unsecured revolving credit agreement initially totaled $2.25 billion, of which $375 million was available for the issuance of letters of credit. On December 29, 2014, upon the affirmative vote of the majority of common shares of Walgreens represented and entitled to vote at the Walgreens special meeting of shareholders to approve the issuance of the shares necessary to complete the Second Step Transaction, the available credit increased to $3.0 billion, of which $500 million is available for the issuance of letters of credit. The issuance of letters of credit reduces the aggregate amount otherwise available under the Revolving Credit Agreement for the making of revolving loans. Borrowings under the Revolving Credit Agreement will bear interest at a fluctuating rate per annum equal to, at our option, the alternate base rate or the reserve adjusted LIBOR, in each case, plus an applicable margin calculated based on our credit ratings.Total upfront fees related to the Term Loan Agreement and Revolving Credit Agreement were $14 million. We pay a facility fee to the financing banks to keep these lines of credit active. At August 31, 2015, there were no borrowings or letters of credit issued against the revolving credit facility.Walgreens guaranteed the punctual payment when due, whether at stated maturity, by acceleration or otherwise, of all obligations of Walgreens Boots Alliance under the Term Loan Agreement and the Revolving Credit Agreement until August 10, 2015, when such guarantees were unconditionally released and discharged (as described below). See Note 10, Short-Term Borrowings and Long-Term Debt, to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K.On November 18, 2014, the Company issued several series of unsecured, unsubordinated notes totaling $8.0 billion with maturities ranging from 2016 to 2044. All notes issued on November 18, 2014 have fixed interest rates, with the exception of the $750 million notes due 2016 which have a floating rate based on the three-month LIBOR plus a fixed spread of 45 basis points.On November 20, 2014, the Company issued a series of unsecured, unsubordinated notes that included total Pound Sterling denominated debt of 700 million ($1.1 billion based on the November 20, 2014 exchange rate) with maturities due 2020 and 2025 and Euro denominated debt of 750 million ($940 million based on the November 20, 2014 exchange rate) due 2026. All notes issued on November 20, 2014 have fixed interest rates. The notes issued on November 18, 2014 and November 20, 2014 are collectively referred to as the WBA notes. The WBA notes were, upon initial issuance, fully and unconditionally guaranteed on an unsecured and unsubordinated basis by Walgreens. See Note 10, Short-Term Borrowings and Long-Term Debt, to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K.On December 19, 2014, Walgreens Boots Alliance and Walgreens entered into a Revolving Credit Agreement (the 364-Day Credit Agreement) with the lenders party thereto. The 364-Day Credit Agreement is a 364-day unsecured, multicurrency revolving facility. The aggregate commitment of all lenders under the 364-Day Credit Agreement is $750 million. The Company pays a facility fee to the financing banks to keep this line of credit active. At August 31, 2015, there were no borrowings against the 364-Day Credit Agreement. On July 9, 2015, the 364-Day Credit Agreement was amended to remove Walgreens as a borrower thereunder, eliminate Walgreens guarantee of all obligations of Walgreens Boots Alliance thereunder and make certain conforming changes to effectuate those modifications, including modifications and deletions of certain definitions and cross-references.The 364-Day Credit Agreement and the Term Loan Agreement and Revolving Credit Agreement described above each contain a covenant to maintain, as of the last day of each fiscal quarter, a ratio of consolidated debt to total capitalization not to exceed 0.60 to 1.00, as well as other customary restrictive covenants. At August 31, 2015, we were in compliance with all such covenants.- 41 -In addition, on July 9, 2015, pursuant to an indenture, dated as of July 17, 2008, between Walgreens and Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as trustee, notices of redemption were given to (i) holders of 1.800% unsecured notes due 2017 (the 2017 Notes) and (ii) holders of 5.25% unsecured notes due 2019 (the 2019 Notes), in each case issued by Walgreens under the Indenture. As a result, on August 10, 2015 (the redemption date), the 2017 Notes in the aggregate principal amount of $1.0 billion were redeemed in full and $750 million aggregate principal amount of the 2019 Notes were redeemed. The partial redemption of the 2019 Notes resulted in $250 million aggregate principal amount of 2019 Notes remaining outstanding. The redemption price with respect to the 2017 Notes was equal to 101.677% of the aggregate principal amount of such notes to be redeemed, plus accrued interest thereon to, but excluding, the redemption date. The redemption price with respect to the 2019 Notes was equal to 111.734% of the aggregate principal amount of such notes to be redeemed, plus accrued interest thereon to, but excluding, the redemption date. On August 10, 2015, upon the completion of the redemptions described above, the Walgreens guarantees of the WBA notes and the Term Loan Agreement and the Revolving Credit Agreement were unconditionally released and discharged in accordance with their terms.Pending Transaction. The cash consideration payable to Rite Aid stockholders pursuant to the Merger Agreement described under \"Recent Development\" above is expected to be financed with a combination of cash on hand and debt financing. On October 27, 2015, the Company entered into a bridge facility commitment letter (the Commitment Letter) with UBS Securities LLC and UBS AG, Stamford Branch for a $12.8 billion senior unsecured bridge facility (the Facility). Subject to certain customary terms and conditions, the Facility may be used to fund, in part, the cash consideration payable to Rite Aid stockholders pursuant to the Merger Agreement, to repay the indebtedness of Rite Aid to be repaid in connection with the transaction and to pay related fees and expenses.Borrowings under the Facility will bear interest at a fluctuating rate equal to, at our option, LIBOR or the applicable base rate, plus a margin calculated as described in the Commitment Letter. We will also pay certain customary fees as described in the Commitment Letter. The Facility, if funded, will mature 364 days after the initial borrowings; provided that the Company can extend up to $3.0 billion of the Facility for an additional 90 day period if desired. The closing of the Facility and the availability of the loans thereunder are subject to the satisfaction of certain customary conditions as provided in the Commitment Letter. The definitive loan documentation for the Facility will contain certain customary representations and warranties, affirmative, negative and financial covenants and events of default consistent with the terms set forth in the Commitment Letter and otherwise substantially similar to the terms set forth in our existing revolving credit agreement, dated as of November 10, 2014, in all material respects unless otherwise mutually and reasonably agreed.As of October 28, 2015, the credit ratings of Walgreens Boots Alliance were:##TABLE_START Rating AgencyLong-Term Debt RatingCommercial Paper RatingStatusMoodysBaa2P-2On review for downgradeStandard  PoorsBBBA-2Negative outlook##TABLE_END In connection with the pending acquisition of Rite Aid, we expect that each of these rating agencies will review and update their ratings of our credit to reflect their assessment of the transaction and related matters. There can be no assurance that any particular rating will be assigned. In assessing our credit strength, both Moodys and Standard  Poors consider various factors including our business model, capital structure, financial policies and financial performance. Our credit ratings impact our borrowing costs, access to capital markets and operating lease costs. The rating agency ratings are not recommendations to buy, sell or hold our debt securities or commercial paper. Each rating may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating agency and should be evaluated independently of any other rating.Pursuant to our arrangements with AmerisourceBergen, we have the right, but not the obligation, to purchase a minority equity position in AmerisourceBergen over time through open market purchases and pursuant to warrants to acquire AmerisourceBergen common stock. We can acquire up to 19,859,795 shares in the open market, which represents approximately 7% of the outstanding AmerisourceBergen common stock on a fully diluted basis, assuming exercise in full of the warrants. The amount of permitted open market purchases is subject to increase in certain circumstances. We have purchased a total of approximately 11.5 million AmerisourceBergen shares in the open market. We have funded and plan to continue funding these purchases over time. Share purchases may be made from time to time in open market transactions or pursuant to instruments and plans complying with Rule 10b5-1.If we elect to exercise the two warrants issued by AmerisourceBergen in full, we would, subject to the terms and conditions of such warrants, be required to make a cash payment of approximately $1.2 billion in connection with the exercise of the first warrant during a six-month period beginning in March 2016 and $1.2 billion in connection with the exercise of the second warrant during a six-month period beginning in March 2017. Our ability to invest in equity in AmerisourceBergen above certain thresholds is subject to the receipt of regulatory approvals.We believe that cash flow from operations, availability under our existing credit facilities and arrangements, current cash and investment balances and our ability to obtain other financing, if necessary, will provide adequate cash funds for foreseeable working capital needs, capital expenditures at existing facilities, dividend payments and debt service obligations for at least the next 12 months. Our cash requirements are subject to change as business conditions warrant and opportunities arise. The timing and size of any new business ventures or acquisitions that we complete may also impact our cash requirements.See Item 7A (Qualitative and Quantitative Disclosures about Market Risk) below for a discussion of certain financing and market risks.COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES The information set forth in Note 13 to our Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K is incorporated herein by reference.- 42 -CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES The consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America and include amounts based on managements prudent judgments and estimates. Actual results may differ from these estimates. Management believes that any reasonable deviation from those judgments and estimates would not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations. To the extent that the estimates used differ from actual results, however, adjustments to the statement of earnings and corresponding balance sheet accounts would be necessary. These adjustments would be made in future periods. Some of the more significant estimates include business combinations, goodwill and other intangible asset impairment, allowance for doubtful accounts, vendor allowances, asset impairments, liability for closed locations, cost of sales and inventory, equity method investments, pension and postretirement benefits and income taxes. We use the following methods to determine our estimates:Business Combinations  We account for business combinations using the acquisition method of accounting, which requires that once control is obtained, all the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, including amounts attributable to noncontrolling interests, be recorded at their respective fair values at the date of acquisition. The determination of fair values of assets and liabilities acquired requires estimates and the use of valuation techniques when market value is not readily available.For intangible assets, we typically use the income approach to determine fair value. The income approach requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions. These estimates and assumptions primarily include, but are not limited to: the discount rates; terminal growth rates; and forecasts of revenue, operating income, depreciation and amortization and capital expenditures. The discount rates which are applied to the projections reflect the risk factors associated with those projections.Although we believe our estimates of fair value are reasonable, actual financial results could differ from those estimates due to the inherent uncertainty involved in making such estimates. Changes in assumptions concerning future financial results or other underlying assumptions could have a significant impact on the determination of the fair value of the intangible assets acquired.Judgment is also required in determining the intangible assets useful life as different assets will have different lives, with some assets determined to have indefinite useful lives.Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment  Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are not amortized, but are evaluated for impairment annually during the fourth quarter, or more frequently if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value. As part of our impairment analysis for each reporting unit, we engage a third party appraisal firm to assist in the determination of estimated fair value for each reporting unit. This determination includes estimating the fair value using both the income and market approaches. The income approach requires management to estimate a number of factors for each reporting unit, including projected future operating results, economic projections, anticipated future cash flows and discount rates. The market approach estimates fair value using comparable marketplace fair value data from within a comparable industry grouping.The determination of the fair value of the reporting units and the allocation of that value to individual assets and liabilities within those reporting units requires us to make significant estimates and assumptions. These estimates and assumptions primarily include, but are not limited to: the selection of appropriate peer group companies; control premiums appropriate for acquisitions in the industries in which we compete; the discount rates; terminal growth rates; and forecasts of revenue, operating income, depreciation and amortization and capital expenditures. The allocation requires several analyses to determine the fair value of assets and liabilities including, among other things, purchased prescription files, customer relationships, pharmacy licenses and trade names. Although we believe our estimates of fair value are reasonable, actual financial results could differ from those estimates due to the inherent uncertainty involved in making such estimates. Changes in assumptions concerning future financial results or other underlying assumptions could have a significant impact on either the fair value of the reporting units, the amount of any goodwill impairment charge, or both.We also compared the sum of the estimated fair values of the reporting units to the Companys total value as implied by the market value of the Companys equity and debt securities. This comparison indicated that, in total, our assumptions and estimates were reasonable. However, future declines in the overall market value of the Companys equity and debt securities may indicate that the fair value of one or more reporting units has declined below its carrying value.One measure of the sensitivity of the amount of goodwill impairment charges to key assumptions is the amount by which each reporting unit passed (fair value exceeds the carrying amount) or failed (the carrying amount exceeds fair value) the first step of the goodwill impairment test. Our reporting units fair values exceeded their carrying amounts ranging from approximately 12% to more than 130%. See Note 9, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.- 43 -Indefinite-lived intangible assets are tested by comparing the estimated fair value of the asset to its carrying value. If the carrying value of the asset exceeds its estimated fair value, an impairment loss is recognized and the asset is written down to its estimated fair value.Our indefinite-lived intangible asset fair value is estimated by discounting the hypothetical royalty payments to their present value over the estimated economic life of the asset. These estimates can be affected by a number of factors including, but not limited to, general economic conditions, availability of market information as well as our profitability.Based on current knowledge, we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the estimates or assumptions used to determine impairment.Allowance for doubtful accounts   The provision for bad debt is based on estimates of recoverability using both historical write-off percentages and specifically identified receivables. Based on current knowledge, we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the estimates or assumptions used to determine the allowance.Vendor allowances  Vendor allowances are principally received as a result of purchases, sales or promotion of vendors products. Allowances are generally recorded as a reduction of inventory and are recognized as a reduction of cost of sales when the related merchandise is sold. Those allowances received for promoting vendors products are offset against advertising expense and result in a reduction of selling, general and administrative expenses to the extent of advertising incurred, with the excess treated as a reduction of inventory costs. Based on current knowledge, we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the estimates or assumptions used to determine vendor allowances.Asset impairments  The impairment of long-lived assets is assessed based upon both qualitative and quantitative factors, including years of operation and expected future cash flows, and tested for impairment annually or whenever events or circumstances indicate that a certain asset may be impaired. If the future cash flows reveal that the carrying value of the asset group may not be recoverable, an impairment charge is immediately recorded. Based on current knowledge, we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the estimates or assumptions used to determine asset impairments.Liability for closed locations  The liability is based on the present value of future rent obligations and other related costs (net of estimated sublease rent) to the first lease option date. Based on current knowledge, we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the estimates or assumptions used to determine the liability.Cost of sales and inventory  Drugstore cost of sales in the Retail Pharmacy USA segment is derived based on point-of-sale scanning information with an estimate for shrinkage and adjusted based on periodic inventory counts. Inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market determined by the last-in, first-out (LIFO) method for the Retail Pharmacy USA segment and on a first-in first-out (FIFO) basis for inventory in the Retail Pharmacy International and Pharmaceutical Wholesale segments except for retail inventory in the Retail Pharmacy International segment, which is valued using the retail method. Based on current knowledge, we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the estimates or assumptions used to determine cost of sales or inventory.Equity method investments   We use the equity method to account for investments in companies if the investment provides the ability to exercise significant influence, but not control, over operating and financial policies of the investee. Our proportionate share of the net income or loss of these companies is included in consolidated net earnings. Judgment regarding the level of influence over each equity method investment includes considering key factors such as our ownership interest, representation on the board of directors, participation in policy-making decisions and material purchase and sale transactions. Based on current knowledge, we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the estimates or assumptions used to determine the amounts recorded for equity method investments.- 44 -Pension and Postretirement Benefits  We have various defined benefit pension plans that cover some of our foreign employees. We also have postretirement healthcare plans that cover qualifying domestic employees. Eligibility and the level of benefits for these plans varies depending on participants status, date of hire and or length of service. Our pension and postretirement expenses and valuations are dependent on assumptions used by our actuaries in calculating those amounts. These assumptions include discount rates, healthcare cost trends, long-term rate of return on plan assets, retirement rates, mortality rates and other factors. In determining our long-term rate of return on plan assets assumption, we consider both the historical performance of the investment portfolio as well as the long-term market return expectations based on the investment mix of the portfolio.Our policy is to fund our pension plans in accordance with applicable regulations. Our postretirement healthcare plans are not funded. Based on current knowledge, we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the estimates or assumptions used to determine pension and postretirement benefits.Income taxes  We are subject to routine income tax audits that occur periodically in the normal course of business. U.S. federal, state, local and foreign tax authorities raise questions regarding our tax filing positions, including the timing and amount of deductions and the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions. In evaluating the tax benefits associated with our various tax filing positions, we record a tax benefit for uncertain tax positions using the highest cumulative tax benefit that is more likely than not to be realized. Adjustments are made to our liability for unrecognized tax benefits in the period in which we determine the issue is effectively settled with the tax authorities, the statute of limitations expires for the return containing the tax position or when more information becomes available. Our liability for unrecognized tax benefits, including accrued penalties and interest, is primarily included in other long-term liabilities and current income taxes on our consolidated balance sheets and in income tax provision in our consolidated statements of earnings.In determining our provision for income taxes, we use income, permanent differences between book and tax income, and enacted statutory income tax rates. The provision for income taxes also reflects our assessment of the ultimate outcome of tax audits in addition to any foreign-based income deemed to be taxable in the United States. Discrete events such as audit settlements or changes in tax laws are recognized in the period in which they occur. Based on current knowledge, we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the estimates or assumptions used to determine the amounts recorded for income taxes.CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS AND COMMITMENTS The following table lists our contractual obligations and commitments at August 31, 2015 (in millions):##TABLE_START   Payments Due by Period   Total  Less Than1 Year  1-3 Years  3-5 Years  Over 5Years Operating leases (1)  $37,970  $3,141  $5,95 2   $5,25 2   $23,62 5  Purchase obligations (2) :  3,455   2,83 6    552   66   1 Open inventory purchase orders  2,114   2,108   6   -   - Real estate development  54 3    325   188   30   - Other corporate obligations  79 8    403   358   3 6    1 Short-term borrowings and long-term debt *   14,444   1,070   754   3,733   8,887 Interest payment on short-term borrowings and long-term debt  6,408   330   64 3   2,718   2, 71 7 Insurance *   567   157   178   76   156 Retirement benefit obligations  1,400   98   121   180   1,001 Closed location obligations *   446   78   100   63   205 Capital lease obligations *(1)   1,198   69   127   121   881 Finance lease obligations  1,324   18   36   36   1,234 Other liabilities reflected on the balance sheet *(3)   1,266   231   307   206   522 Total $71,933  $10, 864   $9, 322   $12,517  $39,230 ##TABLE_END - 45 -##TABLE_START * Recorded on balance sheet. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START (1) Amounts for operating leases and capital leases do not include certain operating expenses under these leases such as common area maintenance, insurance and real estate taxes. These expenses were $437 million for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2015. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START (2) Purchase obligations include agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms, including open purchase orders. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START (3) Includes $297 million ($73 million in less than 1 year, $149 million in 1-3 years, $75 million in 3-5 years and none over 5 years) of unrecognized tax benefits recorded under Accounting Standards Codification Topic 740, Income Taxes. ##TABLE_END The information in the foregoing table is presented as of August 31, 2015 and accordingly does not reflect obligations under agreements we entered into after that date, including the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby described under Recent Development above.OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS We do not have any unconsolidated special purpose entities and, except as described herein, we do not have significant exposure to any off - balance sheet arrangements. The term off - balance sheet arrangement generally means any transaction, agreement or other contractual arrangement to which an entity unconsolidated with us is a party, under which we have: (i) any obligation arising under a guarantee contract, derivative instrument or variable interest; or (ii) a retained or contingent interest in assets transferred to such entity or similar arrangement that serves as credit, liquidity or market risk support for such assets.At August 31, 2015, we have issued $482 million in letters of credit, primarily related to insurance obligations.  We also had $10 million of guarantees to various suppliers outstanding at August 31, 2015. The Company remains secondarily liable on 71 leases. The maximum potential undiscounted future payments related to these leases was $351 million at August 31, 2015. RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS In August 2015, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2015-15, Interest  Imputation of Interest (subtopic 835-30). This ASU provides additional guidance on ASU 2015-03, Interest  Imputation of Interest. These ASUs require debt issuance costs to be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of the debt liability, consistent with debt discounts or premiums and further specify debt issuance costs as part of line-of-credit arrangements should be treated in the manner described above. Recognition and measurement guidance for debt issuance costs are not affected. These ASUs are effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2015 (fiscal 2017). As permitted, the Company early adopted ASU 2015-03 beginning in the third quarter of fiscal 2015. The impact of this ASU reduced non-current assets and long-term debt by $20 million at August 31, 2014, respectively. This ASU has no impact on the statement of earnings or statement of cash flows. The additional guidance provided in ASU 2015-15 had no material financial statement impact.In August 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-14, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606), an update to ASU 2014-09. This ASU amends ASU 2014-09 to defer the effective date by one year for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017 (fiscal 2019). Early adoption is permitted for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016 (fiscal 2018). ASU 2014-09 provides a new revenue recognition standard with a five-step analysis of transactions to determine when and how revenue is recognized. The core principle is that a company should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. The Company is evaluating the effect of adopting this new accounting guidance.In July 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-11, Inventory (Topic 330). This ASU simplifies current accounting treatments by requiring entities to measure most inventories at the lower of cost and net realizable value rather than using lower of cost or market. This guidance does not apply to inventories measured using last-in, first-out (LIFO) method or the retail inventory method (RIM). This ASU is effective prospectively for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016 and interim periods thereafter (fiscal 2018) with early adoption permitted. Upon transition, entities must disclose the accounting change. The Company is evaluating the effect of adopting this new accounting guidance but does not expect adoption will have a material impact on the Companys results of operations, cash flows or financial position.- 46 -In November 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-17, Pushdown Accounting. This ASU provides companies with the option to apply pushdown accounting in its separate financial statements upon occurrence of an event in which an acquirer obtains control of the acquired entity. The election to apply pushdown accounting can be made either in the period in which the change of control occurred, or in a subsequent period. This ASU is effective as of November 18, 2014. The adoption did not have a material impact on the Companys results of operations, cash flows or financial position.In April 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-08, Reporting Discontinued Operations and Disclosures of Disposals of Components of an Entity. This ASU raises the threshold for a disposal to qualify as discontinued operations and requires new disclosures for individually material disposal transactions that do not meet the definition of a discontinued operation. Under the new standard, companies report discontinued operations when they have a disposal that represents a strategic shift that has or will have a major impact on operations or financial results. This update will be applied prospectively and is effective for annual periods, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2014 (fiscal 2016). Early adoption is permitted provided the disposal was not previously disclosed. This update will not have a material impact on the Companys reported results of operations and financial position. The impact is non-cash in nature and will not affect the Companys cash position.CAUTIONARY NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS This report and other documents that we file or furnish with the SEC contain forward-looking statements that are based on current expectations, estimates, forecasts and projections about our future performance, our business, our beliefs and our management's assumptions. In addition, we, or others on our behalf, may make forward-looking statements in press releases or written statements, on the Company's website or in our communications and discussions with investors and analysts in the normal course of business through meetings, webcasts, phone calls, conference calls and other communications. Some of such forward-looking statements may be based on certain data and forecasts relating to our business and industry that we have obtained from internal surveys, market research, publicly available information and industry publications. Industry publications, surveys and market research generally state that the information they provide has been obtained from sources believed to be reliable, but that the accuracy and completeness of such information is not guaranteed. Statements that are not historical facts are forward-looking statements, including, without limitation, statements regarding our future financial and operating performance, as well as forward-looking statements concerning the Merger Agreement with Rite Aid and the transactions contemplated thereby and their possible effects, our integration of Alliance Boots, corporate efficiency initiatives, our commercial agreement with AmerisourceBergen, the arrangements and transactions contemplated by our framework agreement with AmerisourceBergen and their possible effects, estimates of the impact of developments on our earnings, earnings per share and other financial and operating metrics, cough/cold and flu season, prescription volume, pharmacy sales trends, prescription margins, generic prescription drug inflation, number and location of new store openings, network participation, vendor, payer and customer relationships and terms, possible new contracts or contract extensions, competition, economic and business conditions, outcomes of litigation and regulatory matters, the level of capital expenditures, industry trends, demographic trends, growth strategies, financial results, cost reduction initiatives, impairment or other charges, acquisition and joint venture synergies, competitive strengths and changes in legislation or regulations.

These forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and are subject to risks, uncertainties and assumptions that could cause actual results to vary materially from those indicated, including, but not limited to, those relating to the impact of private and public third-party payers' efforts to reduce prescription drug reimbursements, the impact of generic prescription drug inflation, the timing and magnitude of the impact of branded to generic drug conversions, our ability to realize anticipated synergies and achieve anticipated financial, tax and operating results in the amounts and at the times anticipated, supply arrangements including our commercial agreement with AmerisourceBergen, the arrangements and transactions contemplated by our framework agreement with AmerisourceBergen and their possible effects, the risks associated with equity investments in AmerisourceBergen including whether the warrants to invest in AmerisourceBergen will be exercised and the ramifications thereof, the occurrence of any event, change or other circumstance that could give rise to the termination, cross-termination or modification of any of our contractual obligations, the amount of costs, fees, expenses and charges incurred in connection with strategic transactions, whether the actual costs associated with restructuring activities will exceed estimates, our ability to realize expected savings and benefits from cost-savings initiatives, restructuring activities and acquisitions in the amounts and at the times anticipated, the timing and amount of any impairment or other charges, changes in management's assumptions, the risks associated with governance and control matters, the ability to retain key personnel, changes in economic and business conditions generally or in the markets in which we participate, changes in financial markets, interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates, the risks associated with international business operations, the risk of unexpected costs, liabilities or delays, changes in vendor, customer and payer relationships and terms, including changes in network participation and reimbursement terms, risks of inflation in the cost of goods, risks associated with the operation and growth of our customer loyalty programs, competition, risks associated with new business areas and activities, risks associated with acquisitions, divestitures, joint ventures and strategic investments, including those relating to our ability to satisfy the closing conditions and consummate the pending acquisition of Rite Aid and related financing matters on a timely basis or at all, the risks associated with the integration of complex businesses, subsequent adjustments to preliminary purchase accounting determinations, outcomes of legal and regulatory matters, including with respect to regulatory review and actions in connection with the pending acquisition of Rite Aid, and changes in legislation, regulations or interpretations thereof. These and other risks, assumptions and uncertainties are described in Item lA (Risk Factors) above and in other documents that we file or furnish with the SEC. Should one or more of these risks or uncertainties materialize, or should underlying assumptions prove incorrect, actual results may vary materially from those indicated or anticipated by such forward-looking statements. Accordingly, you are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date they are made. Except to the extent required by law, we do not undertake, and expressly disclaim, any duty or obligation to update publicly any forward-looking statement after the date the statement is made, whether as a result of new information, future events, changes in assumptions or otherwise.- 47 -", "7A": " Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosure about Market Risk Interest Rate RiskWe are exposed to interest rate volatility with regard to existing debt issuances. Primary exposures include U.S. Treasury rates, LIBOR and commercial paper rates. From time to time, we use interest rate swaps and forward-starting interest rate swaps to hedge our exposure to the impact of interest rate changes on existing debt and future debt issuances respectively, to reduce the volatility of our financing costs and, based on current and projected market conditions, achieve a desired proportion of fixed versus floating-rate debt. Generally under these swaps, we agree with a counterparty to exchange the difference between fixed-rate and floating-rate interest amounts based on an agreed upon notional principal amount.We also use interest rate caps to protect from rising interest rates on existing floating-rate debt. Information regarding our interest rate swaps, forward starting interest rate swaps, and interest rate caps transactions are set forth in Note 11, Financial Instruments to our Consolidated Financial Statements. These financial instruments are sensitive to changes in interest rates. On August 31, 2015, we had approximately $3 billion in debt obligations that had floating interest rates. A one percentage point increase or decrease in interest rates for the various debt held by the Company would increase or decrease the annual interest expense we recognize and the cash we pay for interest expense by approximately $30 million. This amount excludes the impact of any associated interest rate swaps, forward starting interest rate swaps and interest rate caps.Foreign Currency Exchange Rate RiskAs a result of the Second Step Transaction, fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, primarily with respect to the British Pound Sterling and  Euro,  and certain other foreign currencies, including the Mexican Peso, Chilean Peso, Norwegian Krone and Turkish Lira will affect the Companys net investment in foreign subsid iaries and will cause fluctuations in cash flows related to foreign denominated transactions. We are also exposed to the translation of foreign currency earnings to the U.S. dollar. We enter into foreign currency forward contracts to hedge against the effect of exchange rate fluctuations on non-functional currency cash flows of certain entities denominated in foreign currencies. These transactions are almost exclusively less than 12 months in maturity. In addition, we enter into foreign currency forward contracts that are not designated in hedging relationships to offset, in part, the impacts of certain intercompany activities (primarily associated with intercompany financing transactions ) . As circumstances warrant, we also use basis swaps  as hedging instruments to hedge portions of our net investments in foreign operations. The foreign currency derivative instruments are sensitive to changes in exchange rates. A 1% increase or decrease in exchange rates would increase or decrease our pre-tax income by approximately $3 million due to changes in the value of foreign currency instruments. Excluded from the computation were anticipated transactions, foreign currency trade payables and receivables, and net investments in foreign subsidiaries, which the abovementioned instruments are intended to partially hedge. Equity Price Risk Changes in AmerisourceBergen common stock price and equity volatility may have a significant impact on the value of the warrants to acquire AmerisourceBergen common stock described in Note 11, Financial Instruments to our Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K. As of August 31, 2015, a one dollar change in AmerisourceBergens common stock would, holding other factors constant, increase or decrease the fair value of the Companys warrants by $45 million. Additionally, the Company holds an investment in AmerisourceBergen common stock. As of August 31, 2015, a one dollar change in AmerisourceBergen common stock would increase or decrease the fair value of the Companys investment by $11 million.- 48 -", "8": " Item 8.

AND SUBSIDIARIESNOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTSNote 1. Organization Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. (Walgreens Boots Alliance) and subsidiaries are a global pharmacy-led wellbeing enterprise. Its operations are conducted through three reportable segments (Retail Pharmacy USA, Retail Pharmacy International and Pharmaceutical Wholesale). See Note 19, Segment Reporting for additional discussion.On December 31, 2014, Walgreens Boots Alliance became the successor of Walgreen Co. (Walgreens) pursuant to a merger designed to effect a reorganization of Walgreens into a holding company structure (the Reorganization). Pursuant to the Reorganization, Walgreens became a wholly-owned subsidiary of Walgreens Boots Alliance, a newly-formed Delaware corporation, and each issued and outstanding share of Walgreens common stock, par value $0.078125, converted on a one-to-one basis into Walgreens Boots Alliance common stock, par value $0.01.On December 31, 2014, following the completion of the Reorganization, Walgreens Boots Alliance completed the acquisition of the remaining 55% of Alliance Boots GmbH (Alliance Boots) that Walgreens did not previously own (the Second Step Transaction) in exchange for 3.133 billion in cash and approximately 144.3 million shares of Walgreens Boots Alliance common stock pursuant to the Purchase and Option Agreement dated June 18, 2012, as amended (the Purchase and Option Agreement). Alliance Boots became a consolidated subsidiary and ceased being accounted for under the equity method immediately upon completion of the Second Step Transaction. For financial reporting and accounting purposes, Walgreens Boots Alliance was the acquirer of Alliance Boots. The consolidated financial statements (and other data) reflect the results of operations and financial position of Walgreens and its subsidiaries for periods prior to December 31, 2014 and of Walgreens Boots Alliance and its subsidiaries for periods from and after the effective time of the Reorganization on December 31, 2014.References to the Company refer to Walgreens Boots Alliance and its subsidiaries from and after the effective time of the Reorganization on December 31, 2014 and, prior to that time, to the predecessor registrant Walgreens and its subsidiaries, except as otherwise indicated or the context otherwise requires.Note 2. Summary of Major Accounting Policies Basis of PresentationThe consolidated financial statements include all subsidiaries in which the Company holds a controlling interest. Investments in less than majority-owned companies in which the Company does not have a controlling interest, but does have significant influence are accounted for as equity method investments. All intercompany transactions have been eliminated.  The preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to use judgment in the application of accounting policies, including making estimates and assumptions. The Company bases its estimates on the information available at the time, its experience and on various other assumptions believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Adjustments may be made in subsequent periods to reflect more current estimates and assumptions about matters that are inherently uncertain. Actual results may differ.Because of the acquisition of Alliance Boots, influence of certain holidays, seasonality, foreign currency rates, changes in vendor, payer and customer relationships and terms and other factors on the Companys operations, net earnings for any period may not be comparable to the same period in previous years. In addition, the positive impact on gross profit margins and gross profit dollars typically has been significant in the first several months after a generic version of a drug is first allowed to compete with the branded version, which is generally referred to as a generic conversion. In any given year, the number of major brand name drugs that undergo a conversion from branded to generic status can increase or decrease, which can have a significant impact on the Companys Retail Pharmacy USA segments sales, gross profit margins and gross profit dollars.As part of the Second Step Transaction, the Company acquired the remaining 27.5% noncontrolling interest in Walgreens Boots Alliance Development GmbH (WBAD), a 50/50 global sourcing enterprise established by the Company and Alliance Boots. The Company already owned a 50% direct ownership in WBAD and indirectly owned an additional ownership interest through its previous 45% investment in Alliance Boots, representing a direct and indirect economic interest of 72.5%. The Companys acquisition of the remaining 27.5% effective ownership in WBAD as part of the Second Step Transaction was accounted for as an equity transaction as it has historically been consolidated by the Company. On January 1, 2015, WBAD Holdings Limited sold 320 common shares of WBAD, representing approximately 5% of the equity interests in WBAD, to Alliance Healthcare Italia Distribuzione S.p.A. (AHID), which is not a member of the Companys consolidated group. Under certain circumstances, AHID has the right to put, and WBAD Holdings Limited has the right to call, the 320 common shares of WBAD currently owned by AHID for a purchase price of $100,000.- 54 -Immediately prior to the completion of the Second Step Transaction, the Company held a 45% equity interest in Alliance Boots and recorded its proportionate share of equity income in Alliance Boots in the Companys consolidated financial statements on a three-month reporting lag. Following the Second Step Transaction, the Company eliminated the three-month reporting lag and applied this change retrospectively as a change in accounting principle in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) Topic 250, Accounting Changes and Error Corrections. See Note 3, Change in Accounting Policy for further information.Cash and Cash EquivalentsCash and cash equivalents include cash on hand and all highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less. Credit and debit card receivables from banks, which generally settle within two to seven business days, of $165 million and $229 million were included in cash and cash equivalents at August 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively.The Companys cash management policy provides for controlled disbursement. As a result, the Company had outstanding checks in excess of funds on deposit at certain banks. These amounts, which were $448 million at August 31, 2015, and $267 million at August 31, 2014, are included in trade accounts payable in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets.In addition, the Companys cash management policy provides for a bank overdraft facility for certain disbursement accounts. This overdraft facility represents uncleared and cleared checks in excess of cash balances in the related bank accounts. These amounts, which were $45 million at August 31, 2015, and zero at August 31, 2014, are included in short-term borrowings in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets.Restricted CashThe Company is required to maintain cash deposits with certain banks which consist of deposits restricted under contractual agency agreements and cash restricted by law and other obligations. As of August 31, 2015, the amount of such restricted cash was $184 million. There was no restricted cash as of August 31, 2014.Accounts ReceivableAccounts receivable are stated net of allowances for doubtful accounts. Accounts receivable balances primarily include amounts due from third party providers (e.g., pharmacy benefit managers, insurance companies and governmental agencies), clients and members, as well as vendors and manufacturers. Charges to bad debt are based on estimates of recoverability using both historical write-offs and specifically identified receivables. Activity in the allowance for doubtful accounts was as follows (in millions):##TABLE_START   2015  2014  2013 Balance at beginning of year $  $  $ Bad debt provision  90   86   124 Write-offs  (53)  (67)  (69)Divestitures  (37)  -   - Currency translation  (1)  -   - Balance at end of year $  $  $ ##TABLE_END InventoryThe Company values inventories on a lower of cost or market basis. Inventory includes product costs, inbound freight, direct labor, warehousing costs, overhead costs relating to the manufacture and distribution of products and vendor allowances not classified as a reduction of advertising expense.The Companys Retail Pharmacy USA segment inventory is accounted for using the last-in-first-out (LIFO) method. At August 31, 2015 and August 31, 2014, Retail Pharmacy USA segment inventories would have been greater by $2.5 billion and $2.3 billion, respectively, if they had been valued on a lower of first-in-first-out (FIFO) cost or market basis. The Companys Retail Pharmacy International and Pharmaceutical Wholesale segments inventory is accounted for using the FIFO method, except for retail inventory in the Retail Pharmacy International segment, which is primarily determined using the retail inventory method. Under the retail inventory method, cost is determined by applying a calculated cost-to-retail ratio across groupings of similar items. The cost-to-retail ratio is applied to ending inventory at its current owned retail valuation to determine the cost of ending inventory across groupings of similar items. Current owned retail valuation represents the retail price for which merchandise is offered for sale on a regular basis. Inherent in the retail method calculation are certain management judgments and estimates which can impact the owned retail valuation and, therefore, the ending inventory valuation at cost.- 55 -Equity Method InvestmentsThe Company uses the equity method to account for investments in companies if the investment provides the ability to exercise significant influence, but not control, over operating and financial policies of the investee. The Companys proportionate share of the net income or loss of these companies is included in consolidated net earnings. Judgment regarding the level of influence over each equity method investment includes considering key factors such as the Companys ownership interest, representation on the board of directors, participation in policy-making decisions and material intercompany transactions.Immediately prior to the completion of the Second Step Transaction, the Company held a 45% equity interest in Alliance Boots and recorded its proportionate share of equity income in Alliance Boots within the operating section in the Companys Consolidated Statements of Earnings on a three-month lag. As a result of the Second Step Transaction, the Company eliminated the three-month lag and applied this change retrospectively as a change in accounting policy. See Note 3, Change in Accounting Policy for additional discussion.The Second Step Transaction resulted in the Company acquiring various equity method investments held by Alliance Boots. These newly acquired investments are included together with the previous equity investments of the Company within other non-current assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. See Note 6, Equity Method Investments for further information relating to the Companys equity method investments.InvestmentsThe Companys investments consist principally of corporate debt, other debt securities, and equity securities of publicly-traded companies.The Company classifies its investments in securities at the time of purchase as held-to-maturity or available-for-sale, and re-evaluates such classifications on a quarterly basis. Held-to-maturity investments consist of debt securities that the Company has the intent and ability to retain until maturity. These securities are recorded at cost, adjusted for the amortization of premiums and discounts, which approximates fair value. Available-for-sale debt and equity securities are recorded at fair value. Unrealized holding gains and losses on available-for-sale investments are excluded from earnings and are reported as a separate component of shareholders equity until realized. Realized gains and losses of available-for-sale investments are included in the Consolidated Statement of Earnings.The Company evaluates investments held for other-than-temporary impairment. Such evaluation involves a variety of considerations, including assessments of the risks and uncertainties associated with general economic conditions and distinct conditions affecting specific issuers. Factors considered by the Company include (i) the length of time and the extent to which the fair value has been below cost; (ii) the financial condition, credit worthiness, and near-term prospects of the issuer; (iii) the length of time to maturity; (iv) future economic conditions and market forecasts; (v) the Companys intent and ability to retain its investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for recovery of market value; and (vi) an assessment of whether it is more likely than not that the Company will be required to sell its investment before recovery of market value.Property, Plant and EquipmentDepreciation is provided on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of owned assets. Estimated useful lives range from 20 years for land improvements, 13 to 50 for buildings and building improvements and 3 to 20 for fixtures, plant and equipment. Leasehold improvements, equipment under capital lease and capital lease properties are amortized over their respective estimate of useful life or over the term of the lease, whichever is shorter. Major repairs, which extend the useful life of an asset, are capitalized; routine maintenance and repairs are charged against earnings. The majority of the Companys fixtures and equipment uses the composite method of depreciation. Therefore, gains and losses on retirement or other disposition of such assets are included in earnings only when an operating location is closed, completely remodeled or impaired. Property, plant and equipment consists of (in millions):##TABLE_START   2015  2014 Land and land improvements $3,687  $3,418 Buildings and building improvements  7,705   6,901 Fixtures, plant and equipment  8,904   7,559 Capitalized system development costs and software  1,491   688 Capital lease properties  821   530    22,608   19,096 Less: accumulated depreciation and amortization  7,540   6,839 Balance at end of year $15,068  $12,257 ##TABLE_END - 56 -Depreciation expense for property, plant and equipment was $1.3 billion in fiscal 2015, $923 million in fiscal 2014 and $894 million in fiscal 2013.The Company capitalizes application stage development costs for significant internally developed software projects, such as upgrades to the store point-of-sale system. These costs are amortized over a three to eight year period. Amortization expense for capitalized system development costs and software was $178 million in fiscal 2015, $127 million in fiscal 2014 and $105 million in fiscal 2013. Unamortized costs at August 31, 2015 and 2014 were $1.0 billion and $ 676 million, respectively.Business CombinationsBusiness combinations are accounted for under ASC Topic 805, Business Combinations, using the acquisition method of accounting. The cost of an acquired company is assigned to the tangible and intangible assets purchased and the liabilities assumed on the basis of their fair values at the date of acquisition. The determination of fair values of assets and liabilities acquired requires estimates and the use of valuation techniques when a market value is not readily available. Any excess of purchase price over the fair value of net tangible and intangible assets acquired is allocated to goodwill. The final determination of the fair value of certain assets and liabilities is completed within the one year measurement period as allowed under ASC Topic 805, Business Combinations. Transaction costs associated with business combinations are expensed as they are incurred.Goodwill and Other Intangible AssetsGoodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed. The Company accounts for goodwill and intangibles under ASC Topic 350, Intangibles  Goodwill and Other, which does not permit amortization, but requires the Company to test goodwill and other indefinite-lived assets for impairment annually or whenever events or circumstances indicate that impairment may exist.Intangible assets are amortized on a straight line basis over their estimated useful lives. See Note 9, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets for additional disclosure regarding the Companys intangible assets.WarrantsWalgreens, Alliance Boots and AmerisourceBergen Corporation (AmerisourceBergen) entered into a Framework Agreement dated as of March 18, 2013, pursuant to which (1) Walgreens and Alliance Boots together were granted the right to purchase a minority equity position in AmerisourceBergen, beginning with the right, but not the obligation, to purchase up to 19,859,795 shares of AmerisourceBergen common stock (approximately 7 percent of the then fully diluted equity of AmerisourceBergen, assuming the exercise in full of the warrants described below) in open market transactions; (2) Walgreens and Alliance Boots collectively were issued (a) warrants to purchase up to 22,696,912 shares of AmerisourceBergen common stock at an exercise price of $51.50 per share exercisable during a six-month period beginning in March 2016, and (b) warrants to purchase up to 22,696,912 shares of AmerisourceBergen common stock at an exercise price of $52.50 per share exercisable during a six-month period beginning in March 2017. The parties and affiliated entities also entered into certain related agreements governing relations between and among the parties thereto, including the Shareholders Agreement and the Transaction Rights Agreement.Pursuant to the Reorganization and Second Step Transaction discussed in Note 1, Organization, and Note 2, Summary of Major Accounting Policies, Walgreens and Alliance Boots became wholly-owned subsidiaries of Walgreens Boots Alliance effective December 31, 2014. The Company holds all AmerisourceBergen warrants issued to Walgreens and Alliance Boots in its consolidated subsidiaries.The warrants are valued at the date of issuance and the end of the period using a Monte Carlo simulation. Key assumptions used in the valuation include risk-free interest rates using constant maturity treasury rates; the dividend yield for AmerisourceBergens common stock; AmerisourceBergens common stock price; AmerisourceBergens equity volatility; the number of shares of AmerisourceBergens common stock outstanding; the number of AmerisourceBergens employee stock options and the exercise price; and the details specific to the warrants. The Company reports its warrants at fair value within other non-current assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. A deferred credit from the day-one valuation attributable to the warrants granted to Walgreens is being amortized over the life of the warrants. Gains and losses due to changes in the fair value on warrants are recognized in other income in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings. See Note 11,  Financial Instruments, for additional disclosure regarding the Companys warrants.- 57 -Financial InstrumentsThe Company uses derivative instruments to hedge its exposure to interest rate and currency risks arising from operating and financing activities. In accordance with its risk management policies, the Company does not hold or issue derivative instruments for trading or speculative purposes.Derivatives are recognized on the Consolidated Balance Sheets at their fair values. When the Company becomes a party to a derivative instrument and intends to apply hedge accounting, it formally documents the hedge relationship and the risk management objective for undertaking the hedge which includes designating the instrument for financial reporting purposes as a fair value hedge, a cash flow hedge, or a net investment hedge. The accounting for changes in fair value of a derivative instrument depends on whether the Company had designated it in a qualifying hedging relationship and further, on the type of hedging relationship. The Company applies the following accounting policies:##TABLE_START  Changes in the fair value of a derivative designated as a fair value hedge, along with the gain or loss on the hedged asset or liability attributable to the hedged risk, are recorded in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  The effective portion of changes in the fair value of a derivative designated as a cash flow hedge is recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income and reclassified into earnings in the period or periods during which the hedged item affects earnings. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  The effective portion of changes in the fair value of a derivative designated as a hedge of a net investment in a foreign operation is recorded in cumulative translation adjustments within accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income. Recognition in earnings of amounts previously recorded in cumulative translation adjustments is limited to circumstances such as complete or substantially complete liquidation of the net investment in the hedged investments in foreign operations. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  Changes in the fair value of a derivative not designated in a hedging relationship are recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings along with the ineffective portions of changes in the fair value of derivatives designated in hedging relationships. ##TABLE_END Cash receipts or payments on a settlement of a derivative contract are reported in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows consistent with the nature of the underlying hedged item.For derivative instruments designated as hedges, the Company assesses, both at the hedges inception and on an ongoing basis, whether the derivatives that are used in hedging transactions are highly effective in offsetting changes in fair values or cash flows of hedged items. Highly effective means that cumulative changes in the fair value of the derivative are between 80% and 125% of the cumulative changes in the fair value of the hedged item. In addition, when the Company determines that a derivative is not highly effective as a hedge, hedge accounting is discontinued. When it is probable that a hedged forecasted transaction will not occur, the Company discontinues hedge accounting for the affected portion of the forecasted transaction, and reclassifies any gains or losses in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) to earnings in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings. When a derivative in a hedge relationship is terminated or the hedged item is sold, extinguished or terminated, hedge accounting is discontinued prospectively.Impaired Assets and Liabilities for Store ClosingsThe Company tests long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that a certain asset may be impaired. Once identified, the amount of the impairment is computed by comparing the carrying value of the assets to the fair value, which is based on the discounted estimated future cash flows. Impairment charges included in selling, general and administrative expenses were $386 million in fiscal 2015, primarily related to the Companys Cost Transformation Program (as defined below). Impairment charges recognized in fiscal 2014 and 2013 were $167 million and $30 million, respectively.The Company also provides for future costs related to closed locations. The liability is based on the present value of future rent obligations and other related costs (net of estimated sublease rent) to the first lease option date. The reserve for store closings, including $219 million from locations closed under the Companys restructuring actions, was $446 million as of August 31, 2015 and $257 million as of August 31, 2014. See Note 5, Leases for additional disclosure regarding the Companys reserve for future costs related to closed locations.- 58 -Pension and Postretirement BenefitsThe Company has various defined benefit pension plans that cover some of its foreign employees. The Company also has postretirement healthcare plans that cover qualifying domestic employees. Eligibility and the level of benefits for these plans vary depending participants' status, date of hire and or length of service. Pension and postretirement expenses and valuations are dependent on assumptions used by third party actuaries in calculating those amounts. These assumptions include discount rates, healthcare cost trends, long-term return on plan assets, retirement rates, mortality rates and other factors. See Note 16, Retirement Benefits, for additional disclosure regarding the Company's pension and postretirement benefits.The Company funds its pension plans in accordance with applicable regulations.Noncontrolling InterestsThe Company accounts for its less than 100% interest in consolidated subsidiaries in accordance with ASC Topic 810, Consolidation, and accordingly, the Company presents noncontrolling interests as a component of equity on its Consolidated Balance Sheets and reports the noncontrolling interest net earnings or loss as Net earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings.CurrencyAssets and liabilities of non-U.S. dollar functional currency operations are translated into U.S. dollars at end-of-period exchange rates while revenues, expenses and cash flows are translated at average monthly exchange rates over the period. Equity is translated at historical exchange rates and the resulting cumulative translation adjustments are included as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.For U.S. dollar functional currency operations, foreign currency assets and liabilities are remeasured into U.S. dollars at end-of-period exchange rates, except for nonmonetary balance sheet amounts, which are remeasured from historical exchange rates. Revenues and expenses are recorded at average monthly exchange rates over the period, except for those expenses related to nonmonetary balance sheet amounts, which are remeasured from historical exchange rates. Gains or losses from foreign currency remeasurement and transactions are included in selling, general and administrative expenses within the Consolidated Statements of Earnings. For all periods presented, there were no material operational gains or losses from foreign currency transactions.Revenue RecognitionRevenue is recognized when: (a) persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, (b) delivery has occurred or services have been rendered, (c) the sellers price to the buyer is fixed or determinable, and (d) collectability is reasonably assured. The following revenue recognition policies have been established for the Companys reportable segments.Retail Pharmacy USA and Retail Pharmacy InternationalThe Company recognizes revenue at the time the customer takes possession of the merchandise, after making appropriate adjustments for estimated returns. Revenue does not include sales related taxes. In certain international locations, the Company initially estimates revenue based on expected reimbursements from governmental agencies for dispensing prescription drugs and providing optical services. The estimates are based on historical experience and are updated to actual reimbursement amounts.Pharmaceutical WholesaleWholesale revenue is recognized upon shipment of goods, which is generally also the day of delivery. When the Company acts in the capacity of an agent or a logistics service provider, revenue is the fee received for the service and is recognized when the services have been performed. The Company has determined it is the agent when providing logistics services, which is based on its assessment of the following criteria: (a) whether it is the primary obligor in the arrangement, (b) whether it has latitude in establishing the price, changing the product or performing part of the service, (c) whether it has discretion in supplier selection, (d) whether it is involved in the determination of service specifications, and (e) whether it is exposed to credit risk.Cost of SalesRetail Pharmacy USA cost of sales is derived based upon point-of-sale scanning information with an estimate for shrinkage and is adjusted based on periodic inventories. All other segment cost of sales includes the purchase price of goods and services sold, store and warehouse inventory loss, inventory obsolescence, manufacturing costs, certain direct product design and development costs and supplier rebates. In addition to product costs, cost of sales includes manufacturing costs, warehousing, costs, purchasing costs, freight costs, cash discounts and vendor allowances.- 59 -Vendor Allowances and Supplier RebatesVendor allowances are principally received as a result of purchases, sales or promotion of vendors products. Allowances are generally recorded as a reduction of inventory and are recognized as a reduction of cost of sales when the related merchandise is sold. Those allowances received for promoting vendors products are offset against advertising expense and result in a reduction of selling, general and administrative expenses to the extent of advertising costs incurred, with the excess treated as a reduction of inventory costs.Rebates or refunds received by the Company from its suppliers, mostly in cash, are considered as an adjustment of the prices of the suppliers products purchased by the Company.Selling, General and Administrative Expense sSelling, general and administrative expenses mainly consist of salaries and employee costs, occupancy costs, depreciation and amortization, credit and debit card fees and expenses directly related to stores. In addition, other costs included are headquarters expenses, advertising costs (net of vendor advertising allowances) and insurance.Advertising CostsAdvertising costs, which are reduced by the portion funded by vendors, are expensed as incurred or when services have been received. Net advertising expenses, which are included in selling, general and administrative expenses, were $491 million in fiscal 2015, $265 million in fiscal 2014 and $286 million in fiscal 2013.Gift CardsThe Company sells gift cards to retail store customers and through its websites. The Company does not charge administrative fees on unused gift cards. Gift cards sold in the U.S. do not have an expiration date while most gift cards sold internationally have an expiration date. Income from gift cards sold in the U.S. is recognized when (1) the gift card is redeemed by the customer; or (2) the likelihood of the gift card being redeemed by the customer is remote (gift card breakage) and there is no legal obligation to remit the value of unredeemed gift cards to the relevant jurisdictions. The Companys gift card breakage rate is determined based upon historical redemption patterns. Income from gift cards sold internationally is recognized when (1) the gift cards are redeemed by the customer; or (2) the gift cards expire. Gift card breakage income, which is included in selling, general and administrative expenses, was not significant in fiscal 2015, 2014 or 2013.Points Earned Through Loyalty ProgramsThe Companys primary rewards programs, Balance Rewards and Boots Advantage Card, are accrued as a charge to cost of sales at the time a point is earned. Points are funded internally and through vendor participation, and are credited to cost of sales at the time a vendor-sponsored point is earned. Breakage is recorded as points expire as a result of a members inactivity or if the points remain unredeemed after three years. Breakage income, which is reported in cost of sales, was not significant in fiscal 2015, 2014 or 2013.InsuranceThe Company obtains insurance coverage for catastrophic exposures as well as those risks required by law to be insured. In general, the Companys U.S. subsidiaries retain a significant portion of losses related to workers compensation, property, comprehensive general, pharmacist and vehicle liability, while non-U.S. subsidiaries manage their exposures through insurance coverage with third-party carriers. Management regularly reviews the probable outcome of claims and proceedings, the expenses expected to be incurred, the availability and limits of the insurance coverage, and the established accruals for liabilities. Liabilities for losses are recorded based upon the Companys estimates for both claims incurred and claims incurred but not reported and are not discounted. The provisions are estimated in part by considering historical claims experience, demographic factors and other actuarial assumptions.Stock Compensation PlansIn accordance with ASC Topic 718, Compensation  Stock Compensation, the Company recognizes compensation expense on a straight-line basis over the employees vesting period or to the employees retirement eligible date, if earlier. Total stock-based compensation expense for fiscal 2015, 2014 and 2013 was $109 million, $114 million and $104 million, respectively. The recognized tax benefit was $7 million, $31 million and $30 million for fiscal 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. Unrecognized compensation cost related to non-vested awards at August 31, 2015, was $137 million. This cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted average of three years. See Note 15, Stock Compensation Plans for more information on the Companys stock-based compensation plans.InterestInterest paid, which is net of capitalized interest, was $472 million in fiscal 2015, $161 million in fiscal 2014 and $158 million in fiscal 2013. Interest capitalized as a part of significant construction projects during fiscal 2015, 2014 and 2013 was immaterial.- 60 -Income TaxesThe Company accounts for income taxes according to the asset and liability method. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized based upon the estimated future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured pursuant to tax laws using rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rate is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. Valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amounts more likely than not to be realized.In determining the provision for income taxes, the Company uses income, permanent differences between book and tax income, the relative proportion of foreign and domestic income, enacted statutory income tax rates, projections of income subject to Subpart F rules and unrecognized tax benefits related to current year results. Discrete events such as the assessment of the ultimate outcome of tax audits, audit settlements, recognizing previously unrecognized tax benefits due to lapsing of the applicable statute of limitations, recognizing or de-recognizing benefits of deferred tax assets due to future year financial statement projections and changes in tax laws are recognized in the period in which they occur.The Company is subject to routine income tax audits that occur periodically in the normal course of business. U.S. federal, state, local and foreign tax authorities raise questions regarding the Companys tax filing positions, including the timing and amount of deductions and the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions. In evaluating the tax benefits associated with the various tax filing positions, the Company records a tax benefit for uncertain tax positions using the highest cumulative tax benefit that is more likely than not to be realized. Adjustments are made to the liability for unrecognized tax benefits in the period in which the Company determines the issue is effectively settled with the tax authorities, the statute of limitations expires for the return containing the tax position or when more information becomes available.Earnings Per ShareThe dilutive effect of outstanding stock options on earnings per share is calculated using the treasury stock method. Stock options are anti-dilutive and excluded from the earnings per share calculation if the exercise price exceeds the average market price of the common shares. Outstanding options to purchase common shares that were anti-dilutive and excluded from earnings per share totaled 2.5 million, 3.5 million and 12.3 million in fiscal 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively.New Accounting PronouncementsIn August 2015, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2015-15, Interest  Imputation of Interest (subtopic 835-30). This ASU provides additional guidance on ASU 2015-03, Interest  Imputation of Interest. These ASUs require debt issuance costs to be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of the debt liability, consistent with debt discounts or premiums and further specify debt issuance costs as part of line-of-credit arrangements should be treated in the manner described above. Recognition and measurement guidance for debt issuance costs are not affected. These ASUs are effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2015 (fiscal 2017). As permitted, the Company early adopted ASU 2015-03 beginning in the third quarter of fiscal 2015. The impact of this ASU reduced non-current assets and long-term debt by $20 million at August 31, 2014, respectively. This ASU has no impact on the statement of earnings or statement of cash flows. The additional guidance provided in ASU 2015-15 had no material financial statement impact.In August 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-14, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606), an update to ASU 2014-09. This ASU amends ASU 2014-09 to defer the effective date by one year for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017 (fiscal 2019). Early adoption is permitted for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016 (fiscal 2018). ASU 2014-09 provides a new revenue recognition standard with a five-step analysis of transactions to determine when and how revenue is recognized. The core principle is that a company should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. The Company is evaluating the effect of adopting this new accounting guidance.In July 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-11, Inventory (Topic 330). This ASU simplifies current accounting treatments by requiring entities to measure most inventories at the lower of cost and net realizable value rather than using lower of cost or market. This guidance does not apply to inventories measured using last-in, first-out (LIFO) method or the retail inventory method (RIM). This ASU is effective prospectively for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016 and interim periods thereafter (fiscal 2018) with early adoption permitted. Upon transition, entities must disclose the accounting change. The Company is evaluating the effect of adopting this new accounting guidance but does not expect adoption will have a material impact on the Companys results of operations, cash flows or financial position.- 61 -In November 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-17, Pushdown Accounting. This ASU provides companies with the option to apply pushdown accounting in its separate financial statements upon occurrence of an event in which an acquirer obtains control of the acquired entity. The election to apply pushdown accounting can be made either in the period in which the change of control occurred, or in a subsequent period. This ASU is effective as of November 18, 2014. The adoption did not have a material impact on the Companys results of operations, cash flows or financial position.In April 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-08, Reporting Discontinued Operations and Disclosures of Disposals of Components of an Entity. This ASU raises the threshold for a disposal to qualify as discontinued operations and requires new disclosures for individually material disposal transactions that do not meet the definition of a discontinued operation. Under the new standard, companies report discontinued operations when they have a disposal that represents a strategic shift that has or will have a major impact on operations or financial results. This update will be applied prospectively and is effective for annual periods, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2014 (fiscal 2016). Early adoption is permitted provided the disposal was not previously disclosed. This update will not have a material impact on the Companys reported results of operations and financial position. The impact is non-cash in nature and will not affect the Companys cash position.3. Change in Accounting Policy Walgreens historically accounted for its investment and proportionate share of earnings in Alliance Boots utilizing a three-month reporting lag. Concurrent with the completion of the Second Step Transaction, the Company eliminated the three-month reporting lag. The Company determined that the elimination of the three-month reporting lag was preferable because having Alliance Boots and its subsidiaries have the same period-end reporting date improves overall financial reporting as business performance is reflected in the Companys consolidated financial statements on a more timely basis.In accordance with ASC Topic 810, Consolidation, a change to eliminate a previously existing reporting lag is considered a change in accounting principle in accordance with ASC Topic 250, Accounting Changes and Error Corrections. Changes in accounting principles are to be reported through retrospective application of the new principle to all prior financial statement periods presented. Accordingly, the consolidated financial statements have been recast to reflect the period specific effects of eliminating the three-month reporting lag. The acquisition of the initial 45% interest was reflected in the Companys August 31, 2012 balance sheet. The Companys equity earnings and income statement for the year ended August 31, 2012 were not recasted as the impact was not material.The elimination of the three-month reporting lag for the equity investment in Alliance Boots resulted in the adjustments as of and for the periods indicated below (in millions, except per share amounts). The impact of the change in accounting policy on the fiscal 2015 financial statements is not material.##TABLE_START   Year Ended August 31, 2014  Year Ended August 31, 2013   As Reported  Adjustments  After Change in Accounting Principle  As Reported  Adjustments  After Change in Accounting Principle              Consolidated Statements of Earnings            Equity earnings in Alliance Boots $  $-  $  $  $  $ Operating Income  4,194   -   4,194   3,940   152   4,092 Earnings Before Income Tax Provision  3,557   -   3,557   3,895   152   4,047 Income tax provision  1,526   -   1,526   1,445   54   1,499 Net Earnings  2,031   -   2,031   2,450   98   2,548 Net Earnings Attributable to Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc.  1,932   -   1,932   2,450   98   2,548 Net earnings per common share attributable to Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc.  basic  2.03   -   2.03   2.59   0.10   2.69 Net earnings per common share attributable to Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc.  diluted  2.00   -   2.00   2.56   0.11   2.67                          Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income                        Net Earnings $2,031  $-  $2,031  $ 2,450  $  $ 2,548 Share of other comprehensive income (loss) of Alliance Boots  (41)  23   (18)  (59)  (36)  (95)Cumulative translation adjustments  286   (71)  215   (103)  42   (61)Total Other Comprehensive Income  276   (48)  228   (166)  6   (160)Total Comprehensive Income  2,307   (48)  2,259   2,284   104   2,388 Comprehensive Income Attributable to Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. $2,208  $(48) $2,160  $2,284  $  $2,388 ##TABLE_END - 62 -##TABLE_START   As of August 31, 2014   As Reported (1)   Adjustments  After Change in Accounting Principle Consolidated Balance Sheet      Non-Current Assets:      Equity investment in Alliance Boots $7,248  $  $7,336 Total Non-Current Assets  24,920   88   25,008 Total Assets  37,162   88   37,250 Non-Current Liabilities:            Deferred income taxes  1,048   32   1,080 Total Non-Current Liabilities  7,706   32   7,738 Equity:            Retained earnings  22,229   98   22,327 Accumulated other comprehensive income  178   (42)  136 Total Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc.

Restructuring On April 8, 2015, the Companys Board of Directors approved a plan to implement a new restructuring program (the Cost Transformation Program) as part of an initiative to reduce costs and increase operating efficiencies. The Cost Transformation Program included plans to close approximately 200 stores across the U.S.; reorganize corporate and field operations; drive operating efficiencies; and streamline information technology and other functions. The actions under the Cost Transformation Program focus primarily on the Retail Pharmacy USA division, but includes activities from all segments and are expected to be substantially complete by the end of fiscal 2017. The Company estimates that it will recognize cumulative pre-tax charges to its GAAP financial results of between $1.6 billion and $1.8 billion, including costs associated with lease obligations and other real estate payments, asset impairments and employee termination and other business transition and exit costs. The Company expects to incur pre-tax charges of between $525 million and $600 million for real estate costs, including lease obligations (net of estimated sublease income), between $650 million and $725 million for asset impairment charges relating primarily to asset write-offs from store closures, information technology, inventory and other non-operational real estate asset write-offs, and between $425 million and $475 million for employee severance and other business transition and exit costs. The Company incurred pre-tax charges of $542 million ($223 million related to asset impairment charges, $202 million in real estate costs and $117 million in severance and other business transition and exit costs) related to the Cost Transformation Program in fiscal 2015. The majority of the charges incurred in fiscal 2015 related to activities within the Retail Pharmacy USA division, but also included activities within Retail Pharmacy International. All charges related to the Cost Transformation Program have been recorded within selling, general and administrative expenses. As the program is implemented, the restructuring charges will be recognized as the costs are incurred over time in accordance with GAAP.In March 2014, the Companys Board of Directors approved a plan to close underperforming stores in efforts to optimize and focus resources within the Retail Pharmacy USA operations in a manner intended to increase shareholder value. In fiscal 2015, the Company incurred total pre-tax charges related to this plan of $17 million, primarily related to lease termination costs. In fiscal 2014, the Company incurred pre-tax charges of $209 million ($137 million from lease termination costs, $71 million from asset impairments and $1 million of other charges). All charges related to this plan have been recorded within selling, general and administrative expenses. The Company expects to incur no additional costs related to this plan.Restructuring costs by segment are as follows (in millions):##TABLE_START   Retail Pharmacy       USA  International  Pharmaceutical Wholesale  Consolidated Fiscal 2015        Asset impairments $  $  $-  $ Real estate costs  219   -   -   219 Severance and other business transition and exit costs  105   12   -   117 Total restructuring costs  540  $  $-  $                  Fiscal 2014                Real estate costs $  $-  $-  $ Asset impairments  71   -   -   71 Severance and other business transition and exit costs  1   -   -   1 Total restructuring costs $  $-  $-  $ ##TABLE_END - 64 -5. Leases Initial terms for leased premises in the U.S. are typically 15 to 25 years, followed by additional terms containing renewal options at five-year intervals, and may include rent escalation clauses. Non-U.S. leases are typically for shorter terms and may include cancellation clauses or renewal options. The commencement date of all lease terms is the earlier of the date the Company becomes legally obligated to make rent payments or the date the Company has the right to control the property. The Company recognizes rent expense on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease. In addition to minimum fixed rentals, some leases provide for contingent rentals based upon a portion of sales.The Company continuously evaluates its real estate portfolio in conjunction with its capital needs. The Company has entered into several sale-leaseback transactions. In fiscal 2015, 2014 and 2013, the Company recorded proceeds from sale-leaseback transactions of $867 million, $67 million and $115 million, respectively. In other transactions, the Company negotiated fixed rate renewal options which constitute a form of continuing involvement, resulting in the assets remaining on the balance sheet and a corresponding finance lease obligation.Annual minimum rental commitments under all leases having an initial or remaining non-cancelable term of more than one year are shown below (in millions):##TABLE_START   Financing Obligation  Capital Lease  Operating Lease 2016 $  $  $3,141 2017  18   65   3,008 2018  18   62   2,944 2019  18   60   2,734 2020  18   61   2,518 Later  1,234   881   23,625 Total Minimum Lease Payments $1,324  $1,198  $37,970 ##TABLE_END The capital and finance lease amounts include $1.6 billion of imputed interest and executory costs. Total minimum lease payments have not been reduced by minimum sublease rentals of approximately $214 million on leases due in the future under non-cancelable subleases.The Company provides for future costs related to closed locations. The liability is based on the present value of future rent obligations and other related costs (net of estimated sublease rent) to the first lease option date. In fiscal 2015, 2014 and 2013, the Company recorded charges of $252 million, $177 million and $43 million, respectively, for facilities that were closed or relocated under long-term leases, including stores closed through the Companys store optimization plan and Cost Transformation Program. These charges are reported in selling, general and administrative expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings.The changes in reserve for facility closings and related lease termination charges include the following (in millions):##TABLE_START   Year Ended August 31,   2015  2014 Balance  beginning of period $  $ Provision for present value of non-cancellable lease payments on closed facilities  231   171 Assumptions about future sublease income, terminations and changes in interest rates  (6)  (8)Interest accretion  27   14 Liability assumed through acquisition of Alliance Boots  13   - Cash payments, net of sublease income  (76)  (43)Balance  end of period $  $ ##TABLE_END - 65 -The Company remains secondarily liable on 71 leases.

The Purchase and Option Agreement provided, subject to the satisfaction or waiver of specified conditions, a call option that gave the Company the right, but not the obligation, to acquire the remaining 55% of Alliance Boots in exchange for an additional 3.1 billion in cash as well as an additional 144.3 million Company shares, subject to certain adjustments (the call option). On August 5, 2014, the Purchase and Option Agreement was amended to permit the exercise of the call option beginning on that date, and the Company, through an indirectly wholly-owned subsidiary to which the Company previously assigned its right to the call option, exercised the call option on August 5, 2014. The Companys equity earnings, initial investment and the call option excluded the Alliance Boots minority interest in Galenica Ltd. (Galenica). The Alliance Boots investment in Galenica was distributed to the Alliance Boots shareholders other than Walgreens in May 2013, which had no impact on the Companys financial results.Prior to the closing of the Second Step Transaction on December 31, 2014, the Company accounted for its 45% investment in Alliance Boots using the equity method of accounting. Because the underlying net assets in Alliance Boots were denominated in a foreign currency, translation gains or losses had an impact on the recorded value of the Companys investment. The Company utilized a three-month reporting lag in recording equity income in Alliance Boots, which was eliminated on December 31, 2014 (See Note 3, Change in Accounting Policy) . The Companys share of Alliance Boots earnings was recorded as Equity earnings in Alliance Boots in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings . The Companys investment was recorded as Equity investment in Alliance Boots in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.The Companys initial investment in Alliance Boots exceeded its proportionate share of the net assets of Alliance Boots by $2.4 billion. This premium of $2.4 billion was recognized as part of the carrying value in the Companys equity investment in Alliance Boots. The difference was primarily related to the fair value of Alliance Boots indefinite-lived intangible assets and goodwill. The Companys equity method income from the investment in Alliance Boots was adjusted to reflect the amortization of fair value adjustments in certain definite lived assets of Alliance Boots. The Companys incremental amortization expense associated with the Alliance Boots investment was $14 million, $41 million and $68 million for fiscal 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. The incremental amortization expense was recorded as a reduction in equity earnings from Alliance Boots for all periods prior to closing of the Second Step Transaction on December 31, 2014.- 66 -The Second Step Transaction closed on December 31, 2014. (See Note 1, Organization, and Note 2, Summary of Major Accounting Policies). In connection with this transaction as required by ASC Topic 805, Business Combinations, the Company recorded a non-cash gain of $563 million resulting from the remeasurement of the previously held equity interest in Alliance Boots at its acquisition date fair value. The non-cash gain includes $310 million of other comprehensive losses and foreign currency translation losses reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income. This gain is preliminary and may be subject to change as the Company finalizes purchase accounting. Other Equity Method InvestmentsOther equity method investments primarily relate to equity method investments in Guangzhou Pharmaceuticals Corporation and Nanjing Pharmaceutical Corporation Limited, the Companys pharmaceutical wholesale investments in China and the equity method investment in Option Care Inc. retained through the sale of Walgreens Infusion Services in April 2015. Also included are additional investments in pharmaceutical wholesaling and distribution, retail pharmacy and the Companys hearing care operator and the equity method investment retained through the sale of Take Care Employer in fiscal 2014. Equity investments of the Company are recorded within other non-current assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The Company reported $24 million of post-tax equity earnings in other equity method investments for fiscal 2015, in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings. Post-tax equity earnings from the historical Walgreens other equity method investments in fiscal 2014 and fiscal 2013 were immaterial.Summarized Financial InformationSummarized financial information for the Companys equity method investees is as follows:Balance Sheets (in millions)##TABLE_START   At August 31,   2015 (1)   2014 (1)  Current assets $5,015  $9,074 Non-current assets  1,548   22,363 Current liabilities  3,936   9,372 Non-current liabilities  837   10,608 Shareholders equity (2)   1,790   11,457 ##TABLE_END Statements of Earnings (in millions)##TABLE_START   Year Ended August 31,   2015 (3)   2014 (3)   2013 (3)         Net sales $20,905  $37,624  $36,482 Gross Profit  3,794   8,109   7,632 Net Earnings  791   1,446   1,363 Share of earnings from equity method investments (3)   339   618   496 ##TABLE_END (1)  Net assets in foreign equity method investments are translated at their respective August 31, 2015 and 2014 spot rates.(2) Shareholders equity at August 31, 2015 and 2014 includes $163 million and $283 million respectively, related to noncontrolling interests.(3) Earnings in foreign equity method investments are translated at their respective average exchange rates.7. Available-for-Sale Investments Walgreens, Alliance Boots and AmerisourceBergen entered into a Framework Agreement dated as of March 18, 2013, pursuant to which Walgreens and Alliance Boots together were granted the right to purchase a minority equity position in AmerisourceBergen, beginning with the right, but not the obligation, to purchase up to 19,859,795 shares of AmerisourceBergen common stock (approximately 7 percent of the then fully diluted equity of AmerisourceBergen, assuming the exercise in full of the warrants described within Note 11, Financial Instruments) in open market transactions.- 67 -In conjunction with its long-term relationship with AmerisourceBergen, Walgreens acquired shares of AmerisourceBergen through open market transactions totaling $493 million in fiscal 2014. No AmerisourceBergen shares were purchased in fiscal 2015. As of August 31, 2015, the Company held 11.5 million shares, approximately 5.2% of AmerisourceBergens outstanding common stock at a total fair value of $1.1 billion. The Companys cumulative cost basis of common shares acquired was $717 million at August 31, 2015.Pursuant to ASC Topic 320, Investments  Debt and Equity Securities, the Company accounts for the investment in AmerisourceBergen shares as an available-for-sale investment reported at fair value within other non-current assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. As an available-for-sale investment, changes in the fair value are recorded through other comprehensive income. The value of the investment is recorded at the closing price of AmerisourceBergen common stock as of the balance sheet date.A summary of the cost and fair value of available-for-sale securities, with gross unrealized gains and losses, is as follows (in millions):##TABLE_START   August 31, 2015   Amortized cost basis  Gross unrealized gains  Gross unrealized losses  Fair value AmerisourceBergen common stock $  $  $-  $1,147 Other investments  37   -   (1)  36 Total available-for-sale investments $  $  $(1) $1,183                    August 31, 2014   Amortized cost basis  Gross unrealized gains  Gross unrealized losses  Fair value AmerisourceBergen common stock $  $  $-  $ Total available-for-sale investments $  $  $-  $ ##TABLE_END In fiscal 2015, as a result of the Second Step Transaction, the Company acquired available-for-sale securities. In fiscal 2015, subsequent to the Second Step Transaction, $52 million of acquired available-for-sale securities were sold. In 2014 and 2013, there were no sales of available-for-sale investments.The Company has $36 million of other available-for-sale investments classified within other current assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets at August 31, 2015. There were no available-for-sale investments classified within other current assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets at August 31, 2014. 8. Acquisitions Alliance BootsThe Second Step Transaction closed on December 31, 2014, resulting in the acquisition by the Company of 55% of the issued and outstanding share capital of Alliance Boots, increasing its interest to 100%. (See Note 1, Organization, and Note 2, Summary of Major Accounting Policies). The Company previously accounted for its 45% interest in Alliance Boots as an equity method investment. As a result of the Second Step Transaction, the Company significantly expanded its operations to include pharmacy-led health and beauty retailing and pharmaceutical wholesaling and distribution businesses in major international markets.As a result of the closing of the Second Step Transaction, the Company increased its interest in WBAD, a 50/50 global sourcing enterprise between Walgreens and Alliance Boots, to 100%. Because Walgreens held, prior to the Second Step Transaction, a 50% direct interest and an additional indirect interest in WBAD through its 45% ownership of Alliance Boots, the financial results of WBAD were fully consolidated into the Walgreens financial statements with the remaining 27.5% effective interest being recorded as a noncontrolling interest. The acquisition of the 27.5% noncontrolling interest was accounted for as an equity transaction with no gain or loss recorded in the statement of earnings under ASC Topic 805, Business Combinations. On January 1, 2015, WBAD Holdings Limited sold 320 common shares of WBAD, representing approximately 5% of the equity interests in WBAD, to Alliance Healthcare Italia Distribuzione S.p.A. (AHID), which is not a member of the Companys consolidated group. Under certain circumstances, AHID has the right to put, and WBAD Holdings Limited has the right to call, the 320 common shares of WBAD currently owned by AHID for a purchase price of $100,000.- 68 -The total purchase price of the Second Step Transaction of $15.9 billion included 3.133 billion in cash (approximately $4.9 billion at the December 31, 2014 spot rate of $1.56 to 1.00) and 144.3 million of the Companys common shares at a fair value of $11.0 billion (based on the December 30, 2014 closing market price of $76.05). Of the total purchase price, $13.3 billion was preliminarily allocated to acquire the 55% ownership interest in Alliance Boots and $2.6 billion was preliminarily allocated to acquire the noncontrolling interest in WBAD. The purchase price attributed to the acquisition of the noncontrolling interest in WBAD was determined based on the relative fair value of Alliance Boots and WBAD, respectively.The preliminary impact of the equity transaction is as follows (in millions):##TABLE_START   Amount Consideration attributed to WBAD $2,559 Less: Carrying value of the Companys pre-existing noncontrolling interest  130 Impact to additional paid in capital $2,429 ##TABLE_END As of August 31, 2015, the Company had not completed the analysis to assign fair values to all tangible and intangible assets acquired and therefore the purchase price allocation for Alliance Boots and WBAD has not been completed. The preliminary purchase price allocation will be subject to further refinement and may result in material changes. These changes will primarily relate to the allocation of consideration and the fair value assigned to all tangible and intangible assets acquired and identified. The following table summarizes the consideration paid to acquire the remaining 55% interest in Alliance Boots and the preliminary amounts of identified assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the date of the Second Step Transaction (in millions).##TABLE_START Consideration paid  Cash $4,874 Common stock  10,977 Total consideration transferred  15,851 Less: consideration attributed to WBAD  (2,559)   13,292 Fair value of the investment in Alliance Boots held before the Second Step Transaction  8,149 Total consideration $21,441      Identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed including noncontrolling interests    Cash and cash equivalents $ Accounts receivable  3,799 Inventories  3,713 Other current assets  894 Property, plant and equipment  3,847 Intangible assets  11,691 Other non-current assets  2,218 Trade accounts payable, accrued expenses and other liabilities  (7,711)Borrowings  (9,010)Deferred income taxes  (2,461)Other non-current liabilities  (389)Noncontrolling interests  (412)Total identifiable net assets and noncontrolling interests  6,592 Goodwill $14,849 ##TABLE_END Significant changes from the preliminary purchase price valuation at February 28, 2015 include an increase in identified intangible assets based on updated financial information, higher deferred income taxes as a result of the increase in identified intangible assets and increases in equity investments and noncontrolling interests based on updated financial information. The preliminary purchase price allocation will be subject to further refinement and may result in material changes.- 69 -As a result of the Company acquiring the remaining 55% interest in Alliance Boots, the Companys previously held 45% interest was remeasured to fair value, resulting in a gain of $563 million. This gain has been recognized as Gain on previously held equity interest in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings. This gain is preliminary and may be subject to change as the Company finalizes purchase accounting.The fair value of the previously held equity interest of $8.1 billion in Alliance Boots was determined using the i ncome a pproach methodology. The fair value for trade names and trademarks was determined using the relief from royalty method of the income approach; pharmacy licenses and customer relationships were determined using the excess earnings method of the income approach; and loyalty card holders were determined using the incremental cash flow method which is a form of the income approach. Personal property fair values were determined primarily using the indirect cost approach, while real property fair values were determined using the income, market and/or cost approach. The fair value measurements of the previously held equity interest and intangible assets are based on significant inputs not observable in the market, and thus represent Level 3 measurements. The fair value estimates for the previously held equity interest and intangible assets are based on (a) projected discounted cash flows, (b) historical and projected financial information, (c) synergies including cost savings and (d) attrition rates , as relevant, that market participants would consider when estimating fair value s . The preliminary identified definite and indefinite lived intangible assets were as follows:##TABLE_START Definite-Lived Intangible Assets Weighted-Average Useful Life (in years)  Amount (in millions) Customer relationships 12  $1,311 Loyalty card holders 12   742 Trade names and trademarks 7   399 Favorable lease interests 8   93 Total    $2,545 ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets Amount (in millions) Trade names and trademarks $6,657 Pharmacy licenses  2,489 Total $9,146 ##TABLE_END The preliminary goodwill of $14.8 billion arising from the Second Step Transaction primarily reflects the expected purchasing synergies, operating efficiencies by benchmarking performance and applying best practices across the combined company, consolidation of operations, reductions in selling, general and administrative expenses and combining workforces.Following the completion of the Second Step Transaction, the Company has realigned its operations into three reportable segments: Retail Pharmacy USA, Retail Pharmacy International and Pharmaceutical Wholesale. The Company determined that the preliminary goodwill should be allocated across all segments recognizing that each segment will benefit from the expected synergies.The preliminary goodwill allocated to the Retail Pharmacy USA segment of $7.3 billion comprises $3.5 billion of synergy benefits allocable to the segment on a source of procurement benefit basis and $3.8 billion determined on a with-and-without basis. The source of procurement benefit basis allocates the synergy benefits to the segment whose purchase gave rise to the benefit. The with-and-without basis computes the difference between the fair value of the pre-existing business before the combination and its fair value after the combination, and since the pre-existing Walgreens business is now within the Retail Pharmacy USA segment, all of this difference is allocated to this segment. The with-and-without computation recognized that if the Second Step Transaction did not happen, then this was likely to negatively impact the existing Walgreens business, which already had a 45% interest in Alliance Boots, as the expected purchasing synergies and other benefits resulting from a full combination would not be fully realized.Of the remaining preliminary goodwill, $3.9 billion was allocated to the Retail Pharmacy International segment and $3.6 billion was allocated to the Pharmaceutical Wholesale segment. The allocation of the goodwill to the individual reporting units within the respective segments has not been completed. Substantially all of the goodwill recognized is not expected to be deductible for income tax purposes.- 70 -The Company incurred legal and other professional services costs related to the Second Step Transaction, which were included in selling, general and administrative expenses, of $87 million in fiscal 2015.The preliminary fair value of the assets acquired includes inventory having an estimated fair value of $3.7 billion. This fair value includes a $107 million fair value adjustment to capitalize the estimated profit in acquired finished goods inventory as of the date of the Second Step Transaction, which was expensed to cost of sales over the first inventory turn.The following table presents supplemental unaudited condensed pro forma consolidated information for 2015 and 2014 as if the Second Step Transaction had occurred on September 1, 2013, the first day of the Companys fiscal 2014. As described in Note 3, Change in Accounting Policy, the information has been presented without a lag. The unaudited condensed pro forma information reflect certain adjustments related to past operating performance and acquisition accounting adjustments, such as increased amortization expense based on the fair valuation of assets acquired, the impact of acquisition financing, transaction costs and the related income tax effects. The unaudited condensed pro forma information does not include any anticipated synergies which may be achievable subsequent to the date of the Second Step Transaction. The unaudited condensed pro forma information also excludes certain non-recurring items such as the gain on Walgreens previously held 45% investment in Alliance Boots and other transaction related costs. Accordingly, the unaudited condensed pro forma information has been prepared for comparative purposes only and is not intended to be indicative of what the Companys results would have been had the Second Step Transaction occurred at the beginning of the periods presented or the results which may occur in the future.##TABLE_START   Year Ended August 31,   2015  2014 (in millions, except per share amounts)    Net sales $116,491  $113,896 Net earnings  4,278   3,884          Net earnings per common share:        Basic $4.10  $3.54 Diluted  4.06   3.50 ##TABLE_END Actual results from Alliance Boots operations included in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings since December 31, 2014, the date of the Second Step Transaction, are as follows (in millions, except per share amounts):##TABLE_START   Year EndedAugust 31, (in millions, except per share amounts)  Net sales $22,470 Net earnings  853      Net earnings per common share:    Basic $0.82 Diluted  0.81 ##TABLE_END Other Acquisitions and DivestituresThe aggregate purchase price of all businesses acquired in fiscal 2015, excluding Alliance Boots, net of cash received was $371 million for fiscal 2015. In fiscal 2015, the Company acquired Liz Earle Beauty Co. Ltd, owner of the Liz Earle skincare brand in addition to other asset acquisitions, primarily pharmacy prescription files. These acquisitions added $ 126 million to goodwill and $255 million to intangible assets. Any remaining fair value relates to immaterial amounts of tangible assets, less liabilities assumed. Operating results of the businesses acquired have been included in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings from their respective acquisition dates forward. Pro forma results of the Company, assuming all of the other acquisitions had occurred at the beginning of each period presented, would not be materially different from the results reported. Additionally, in fiscal 2015 the Company completed the sale of a majority interest in its subsidiary, Walgreens Infusion Services to Madison Dearborn Partners (MDP). Walgreens Infusion Services became a new independent, privately-held company named Option Care Inc. MDP owns a majority interest in the new company. Walgreens Boots Alliance owns a significant minority interest and has representatives on the companys board of directors. - 71 -In fiscal 2014, the Company acquired certain assets of Kerr Drug and its affiliates for $170 million. This acquisition included 76 retail locations as well as a specialty pharmacy business and a distribution center. The Kerr Drug acquisition added $42 million to goodwill and $54 million to intangible assets, primarily prescription files and payer contracts, with $74 million allocated to net tangible assets. Additionally, the Company completed the sale of a majority interest in its subsidiary, Take Care Employer Solutions, LLC (Take Care Employer) to Water Street Healthcare Partners (Water Street). At the same time, Water Street made an investment in CHS Health Services (CHS), an unrelated entity and merged CHS with Take Care Employer to create a leading worksite health company dedicated to improving the cost and quality of employee health care. Water Street owns a majority interest in the new company while the Company owns a significant minority interest and has representatives on the new companys board of directors.9. Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets Goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets are not amortized, but are evaluated for impairment annually during the fourth quarter, or more frequently if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value. As part of the Companys impairment analysis for each reporting unit, the Company engaged a third party appraisal firm to assist in the determination of estimated fair value for each unit. This determination included estimating the fair value using both the income and market approaches. The income approach requires management to estimate a number of factors for each reporting unit, including projected future operating results, economic projections, anticipated future cash flows and discount rates. The market approach estimates fair value using comparable marketplace fair value data from within a comparable industry grouping.The determination of the fair value of the reporting units and the allocation of that value to individual assets and liabilities within those reporting units requires the Company to make significant estimates and assumptions. These estimates and assumptions primarily include, but are not limited to: the selection of appropriate peer group companies; control premiums appropriate for acquisitions in the industries in which the Company competes; the discount rate; terminal growth rates; and forecasts of revenue, operating income, depreciation and amortization and capital expenditures. The allocation requires several analyses to determine the fair value of assets and liabilities including, among other things, trade names and trademarks, pharmacy licenses, customer relationships and purchased prescription files. Although the Company believes its estimates of fair value are reasonable, actual financial results could differ from those estimates due to the inherent uncertainty involved in making such estimates. Changes in assumptions concerning future financial results or other underlying assumptions could have a significant impact on either the fair value of the reporting units, the amount of the goodwill impairment charge, or both. The Company also compared the sum of the estimated fair values of its reporting units to the Companys total value as implied by the market value of its equity and debt securities. This comparison indicated that, in total, its assumptions and estimates were reasonable. However, future declines in the overall market value of the Companys equity and debt securities may indicate that the fair value of one or more reporting units has declined below its carrying value.Goodwill added as a result of the Second Step Transaction has been preliminarily allocated to the Retail Pharmacy USA, Retail Pharmacy International and Pharmaceutical Wholesale reportable segments.- 72 -Changes in the carrying amount of goodwill by reportable segment consist of the following activity (in millions):##TABLE_START   Retail Pharmacy USA  Retail Pharmacy International  Pharmaceutical Wholesale  Total August 31, 2013 $2,410  $-  $-  $2,410 Acquisitions  58   -   -   58 Sale of business (1)   (92)  -   -   (92)Other (3)   (17)  -   -   (17)August 31, 2014  2,359   -   -   2,359 Acquisitions  7,290   4,036   3,646   14,972 Sale of business (2)   (706)  -   -   (706)Other (3)   (3)  -   -   (3)Currency translation adjustments  -   (138)  (112)  (250)August 31, 2015 $8,940  $3,898  $3,534  $16,372 ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START (1) Represents goodwill associated with Walgreens Take Care Employer business which was sold in June 2014.##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START (2) Represents goodwill associated with Walgreens Infusion Services business which was sold in April 2015.##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START (3) Other primarily represents immaterial purchase accounting adjustments for prior year Company acquisitions.##TABLE_END In fiscal 2015, as a result of the Second Step Transaction, t he Company recorded $14.8 billion of goodwill and $11.7 billion of intangible assets in conjunction with the preliminary purchase accounting. See Note 8, Acquisitions for additional information regarding the transaction. Additionally, in fiscal 2015 the Company completed the sale of a majority interest in its subsidiary, Walgreens Infusion Services. As a result, $706 million of goodwill allocated to this business was removed from the Consolidated Balance Sheet. In fiscal 2014, the Company completed the sale of a majority interest in its subsidiary, Take Care Employer. As a result, $92 million of goodwill allocated to this business was removed from the Consolidated Balance Sheet. Additionally, the Company purchased certain assets of Kerr Drug and its affiliates for $170 million, subject to adjustment in certain circumstances.

As of August 31, 2015, Walgreens Boots Alliance has borrowed 1.45 billion ($2.2 billion at the August 31, 2015 spot rate of $1.54 to 1) under the Term Loan Agreement. Borrowings under the Term Loan Agreement bear interest at a fluctuating rate per annum equal to the reserve adjusted LIBOR plus an applicable margin based on the Companys credit ratings. The fair value of the Term Loan Agreement as of August 31, 2015 was $2.2 billion. Fair value of the Term Loan Agreement was determined based upon quoted market prices.On November 10, 2014, Walgreens Boots Alliance and Walgreens entered into a five-year unsecured, multicurrency revolving credit agreement (the Revolving Credit Agreement), replacing prior Walgreens agreements dated July 20, 2011 and July 23, 2012.

On December 29, 2014, upon the affirmative vote of the majority of common shares of Walgreens represented and entitled to vote at the Walgreens special meeting of shareholders to approve the issuance of the shares necessary to complete the Second Step Transaction, the available credit increased to $3.0 billion, of which $500 million is available for the issuance of letters of credit. The issuance of letters of credit reduces the aggregate amount otherwise available under the Revolving Credit Agreement for the making of revolving loans. Borrowings under the Revolving Credit Agreement will bear interest at a fluctuating rate per annum equal to, at Walgreens Boots Alliances option, the alternate base rate or the reserve adjusted LIBOR, in each case, plus an applicable margin calculated based on the Companys credit ratings.Total upfront fees related to the Term Loan Agreement and Revolving Credit Agreement were $14 million. The Company pays a facility fee to the financing banks to keep these lines of credit active. At August 31, 2015, there were no borrowings or letters of credit issued against the revolving credit facility.In accordance with the terms of each of the Term Loan Agreement and the Revolving Credit Agreement, Walgreens guaranteed the punctual payment when due, whether at stated maturity, by acceleration or otherwise, of all of Walgreens Boots Alliances obligations under the Term Loan Agreement and Revolving Credit Agreement, as applicable. Pursuant to the terms of the Term Loan Agreement and Revolving Credit Agreement, as applicable, each such guarantee would automatically terminate, and Walgreens obligations thereunder would be unconditionally released and discharged, if (i) the aggregate outstanding principal amount of Capital Markets Indebtedness, including the Existing Notes, and Commercial Bank Indebtedness (as each such capitalized term is defined in the Term Loan Agreement or Revolving Credit Agreement, as applicable), in each case, of Walgreens is less than $2.0 billion and (ii) Walgreens does not guarantee any Capital Markets Indebtedness or Commercial Bank Indebtedness, in each case, of Walgreens Boots Alliance. On August 10, 2015, as a result of completing the redemption of certain of the Walgreens notes described above and the release of the guarantees of the Walgreens Boots Alliance notes described above, such guarantees of the Term Loan Agreement and Revolving Credit Agreement automatically terminated, without penalty to Walgreens or Walgreens Boots Alliance and the obligations of Walgreens thereunder were unconditionally released and discharged.On December 19, 2014, Walgreens Boots Alliance and Walgreens entered into a Revolving Credit Agreement (the 364-Day Credit Agreement) with the lenders party thereto. The 364-Day Credit Agreement is a 364-day unsecured, multicurrency revolving facility. The aggregate commitment of all lenders under the 364-Day Credit Agreement is $750 million. The Company pays a facility fee to the financing banks to keep this line of credit active. On July 9, 2015, Walgreens Boots Alliance amended the 364-Day Credit Agreement to remove Walgreens as a borrower thereunder, eliminate Walgreens guarantee of all obligations of Walgreens Boots Alliance thereunder and make certain conforming changes to effectuate those modifications, including modifications and deletions of certain definitions and cross-references. At August 31, 2015, there were no borrowings against the 364-Day Credit Agreement.The Term Loan Agreement, Revolving Credit Agreement and the 364-Day Revolving Credit Agreement each contain a covenant to maintain, as of the last day of each fiscal quarter, a ratio of consolidated debt to total capitalization not to exceed 0.60 to 1.00, as well as other customary restrictive covenants. At August 31, 2015, we were in compliance with all such covenants.- 79 -11. Financial Instruments The Company uses derivative instruments to manage its exposure to interest rate and foreign currency exchange risks. As a result of the Second Step Transaction, the Company acquired all the derivative instruments held by Alliance Boots at their acquisition date fair values.The notional amounts, fair value and balance sheet presentation of derivative instruments outstanding as of August 31, 2015, excluding warrants which are presented separately in this footnote, were as follows (in millions):##TABLE_START   Notional (1)   Fair Value Location in Consolidated Balance SheetsDerivatives designated as fair value hedges :     Interest rate swaps $  $ Other non-current assetsDerivatives not designated as hedges :         Foreign currency forwards  1,205   34 Other current assetsForeign currency forwards  495   9 Other current liabilitiesBasis swap  1   - Other current assets##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START (1) Amounts are presented in U.S. dollar equivalents.##TABLE_END The notional amounts, fair value and balance sheet presentation of derivative instruments outstanding as of August 31, 2014, excluding warrants which are presented separately in this footnote, are as follows (in millions):##TABLE_START   Notional  Fair Value Location in Consolidated Balance SheetsDerivatives designated as fair value hedges :     Interest rate swaps $1,000  $ Other non-current assetsDerivatives designated as cash flow hedges :         Forward interest rate swaps  1,500   44 Other non-current liabilities##TABLE_END The Company uses interest rate swaps to manage the interest rate exposure associated with some of its fixed-rate borrowings and designates them as fair value hedges. The Company uses forward starting interest rate swaps to hedge its interest rate exposure of some of its anticipated debt issuances and designates them as cash flow hedges.The Company utilizes foreign currency forward contracts and other foreign currency derivatives to hedge significant committed and highly probable future transactions and cash flows denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the Company or its subsidiaries. The Company has significant non-US dollar denominated net investments and uses foreign currency denominated financial instruments, specifically foreign currency derivatives and foreign currency denominated debt, to hedge its foreign currency risk.Fair Value HedgesThe Company entered into a series of interest rate swaps, converting $750 million of its 5.250% fixed rate notes to a floating interest rate based on the six-month LIBOR in arrears plus a constant spread and an interest rate swap converting $250 million of its 5.250% fixed rate notes to a floating interest rate based on the one-month LIBOR in arrears plus a constant spread. All swap termination dates coincide with the notes maturity date, January 15, 2019. These swaps were designated as fair value hedges. On August 10, 2015, the Company terminated $500 million of the six-month LIBOR in arrears swaps and all of the one-month LIBOR in arrears swaps in connection with the repayment of the associated debt as described in Note 10, Short-Term Borrowings and Long-Term Debt.The gains and losses due to changes in fair value on the swaps and on the hedged notes attributable to interest rate risk were recognized as follows (in millions):##TABLE_START Location in Consolidated Statements of Earnings 2015  2014  2013 Interest rate swapsInterest expense, net $(4) $(15) $ NotesInterest expense, net  6   15   (43)##TABLE_END - 80 -The changes in fair value of the Companys debt that was swapped from fixed to variable rate and designated as fair value hedges are included in short-term and long-term debt on the Consolidated Balance Sheets (see Note 10, Short-Term Borrowings and Long-Term Debt). At August 31, 2015 and August 31, 2014, the cumulative fair value adjustments resulted in an increase in long-term debt of $1 million and $12 million, respectively. No material gains or losses were recorded from ineffectiveness during fiscal 2015, 2014 or 2013.Cash Flow HedgesIn fiscal 2014, the Company entered into a series of forward starting interest rate swap transactions locking in the then current three-month LIBOR interest rate on $1.5 billion of the then anticipated issuance of debt, with expected maturity tenures of 10 and 30 years. The swap transactions were designated as cash flow hedges of the variability in the expected cash outflows of interest payments on the then forecasted debt due to changes in the benchmark interest rates. In November 2014, in conjunction with the issuance of the $2.0 billion notes maturing in fiscal 2024 and the $1.5 billion notes maturing in fiscal 2044, the Company terminated these forward starting interest rate swaps, locking in the effective yields on the related debt. A cash payment of $45 million was made to settle the 10-year swap and a cash payment of $18 million was made to settle the 30-year swap in November 2014. The changes in fair value of the swaps until their termination were included in other comprehensive income, and any ineffectiveness was recorded directly to interest expense in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings. The cumulative changes included in other comprehensive income will be amortized into earnings in the same periods during which interest expense on the identified debt is recognized.As a result of the Second Step Transaction, the Company assumed $9.0 billion of Alliance Boots existing debt, a portion of which was hedged using interest rate swaps and interest rate caps. In January 2015, the Company repaid substantially all of the assumed debt and simultaneously terminated swaps converting 1.0 billion of outstanding debt from floating to fixed rates with no material gain or loss recognized. In July 2015, 1.0 billion of floating to fixed rate swaps which were not designated as hedging instruments matured. Interest rate caps with notional principal amounts of 1.5 billion and 2.0 billion to protect the Company from rising interest rates on the corresponding amounts of assumed Alliance Boots existing debt were in place on completion of the Second Step Transaction. In January 2015, interest rate caps with an aggregate notional principal of 600 million were terminated with no material gain or loss recognized. The remaining caps matured in July 2015.There were no material gains and losses due to the change in fair value of derivatives designated as cash flow hedges recognized in other comprehensive income in fiscal 2014 or 2013.No portion of the derivatives designated as cash flow hedges was excluded from hedge assessment. No material gains or losses were recorded in earnings from ineffectiveness in fiscal 2015, 2014 or 2013.Derivatives not Designated as HedgesThe Company enters into derivative transactions that are not designated as accounting hedges. These derivative instruments are economic hedges of interest rate and foreign currency risks. Income or expense due to changes in fair value of these derivative instruments were recognized in earnings as follows (in millions):##TABLE_START Location in ConsolidatedStatements of Earnings 2015  2014  2013 Interest rate swapsInterest expense, net $  $-  $- Foreign currency forwardsSelling, general and administrative expense  78   -   - Second Step Transaction foreign currency forwardsOther income (expense)  (166)  -   - Foreign currency forwardsOther income (expense)  72   -   - ##TABLE_END WarrantsAs discussed in Note 2, Summary of Major Accounting Policies, the Company holds (a) a warrant to purchase up to 22,696,912 shares of AmerisourceBergen common stock at an exercise price of $51.50 per share exercisable during a six-month period beginning in March 2016, and (b) a warrant to purchase up to 22,696,912 shares of AmerisourceBergen common stock at an exercise price of $52.50 per share exercisable during a six-month period beginning in March 2017. The warrants issued to Alliance Boots were acquired by the Company as part of the Second Step Transaction.- 81 -The Company reports its warrants at fair value. The fair value and balance sheet presentation of warrants was as follows (in millions):##TABLE_START Location in Consolidated Balance Sheets August 31,  August 31,  Asset derivatives not designated as hedges:     WarrantsOther non-current assets $2,140  $ ##TABLE_END The gains and losses due to changes in fair value of the warrants recognized in earnings were as follows (in millions):##TABLE_START Location in Consolidated Statements of Earnings 2015  2014  2013 WarrantsOther income (expense) $  $  $ ##TABLE_END Derivatives Credit RiskCounterparties to derivative financial instruments expose the Company to credit-related losses in the event of counterparty nonperformance, and the Company regularly monitors the credit worthiness of each counterparty.Derivatives OffsettingThe Company does not offset the fair value amounts of derivative instruments subject to master netting agreements in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.12. Fair Value Measurements The Company measures certain assets and liabilities in accordance with ASC Topic 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures, which defines fair value as the price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. In addition, it establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes observable and unobservable inputs used to measure fair value into three broad levels:##TABLE_START Level 1 - Quoted prices in active markets that are accessible at the measurement date for identical assets and liabilities. The fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to Level 1 inputs.##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START Level 2 -Observable inputs other than quoted prices in active markets.##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START Level 3 -Unobservable inputs for which there is little or no market data available. The fair value hierarchy gives the lowest priority to Level 3 inputs.##TABLE_END Assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis were as follows (in millions):##TABLE_START   August 31, 2015  Level 1  Level 2  Level 3 Assets :        Restricted cash (1)  $  $  $-  $- Money market funds (2)   2,043   2,043   -   - Available-for-sale investments (3)   1,183   1,183   -   - Interest rate swaps (4)   2   -   2   - Foreign currency forwards (5)   34   -   34   - Warrants (6)   2,140   -   2,140   - Liabilities :                Foreign currency forwards (5)   9   -   9   - ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START   August 31, 2014  Level 1  Level 2  Level 3 Assets :        Money market funds (2)  $1,879  $1,879  $-  $- Available-for-sale investments (3)   887   887   -   - Interest rate swaps (4)   16   -   16   - Warrants (6)   553   -   553   - Liabilities :                Forward interest rate swaps (7)   44   -   44   - ##TABLE_END - 82 -##TABLE_START (1) Restricted cash consists of deposits restricted under agency agreements and cash restricted by law and other obligations.##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START (2) Money market funds are valued at the closing price reported by the fund sponsor.##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START (3) Fair values of quoted investments are based on current bid prices as of the balance sheet dates.

Key assumptions used in the valuation include risk-free interest rates using constant maturity treasury rates; the expected dividend yield for AmerisourceBergens common stock; AmerisourceBergens common stock price at the valuation date; AmerisourceBergens equity volatility; the number of shares of AmerisourceBergens common stock outstanding; the number of AmerisourceBergen employee stock options and the exercise price; and the details specific to the warrants.##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START (7) Forward interest rate swaps were valued using three-month LIBOR rates. See Note 11, Financial Instruments for additional disclosures.##TABLE_END There were no transfers between levels in fiscal 2015 or 2014.The Company reports its debt instruments under the guidance of ASC Topic 825, Financial Instruments, which requires disclosure of the fair value of the Companys debt in the footnotes to the consolidated financial statements. Unless otherwise noted, the fair value for all notes was determined based upon quoted market prices and therefore categorized as Level 1. See Note 10, Short-Term Borrowings and Long-Term Debt for further details. The carrying values of accounts receivable and trade accounts payable approximated their respective fair values due to their short-term nature.13. Commitments and Contingencies The Company is involved in legal proceedings and is subject to investigations, inspections, audits, inquiries and similar actions by governmental authorities, arising in the normal course of the Companys business, including the matters described below. Legal proceedings, in general, and securities and class action litigation, in particular, can be expensive and disruptive. Some of these suits may purport or may be determined to be class actions and/or involve parties seeking large and/or indeterminate amounts, including punitive or exemplary damages, and may remain unresolved for several years. From time to time, the Company is also involved in legal proceedings as a plaintiff involving antitrust, tax, contract, intellectual property and other matters. Gain contingencies, if any, are recognized when they are realized. The results of legal proceedings are often uncertain and difficult to predict, and the costs incurred in litigation can be substantial, regardless of the outcome. The Company believes that its defenses and assertions in pending legal proceedings have merit, and does not believe that any of these pending matters, after consideration of applicable reserves and rights to indemnification, will have a material adverse effect on the Companys consolidated financial position. However, substantial unanticipated verdicts, fines and rulings do sometimes occur. As a result, the Company could from time to time incur judgments, enter into settlements or revise its expectations regarding the outcome of certain matters, and such developments could have a material adverse effect on its results of operations in the period in which the amounts are accrued and/or its cash flows in the period in which the amounts are paid.On a quarterly basis, the Company assesses its liabilities and contingencies for outstanding legal proceedings and reserves are established on a case-by-case basis for those legal claims for which management concludes that it is probable that a loss will be incurred and that the amount of such loss can be reasonably estimated. Substantially all of these contingencies are subject to significant uncertainties and, therefore, determining the likelihood of a loss and/or the measurement of any loss can be complex. With respect to litigation and other legal proceedings where the Company has determined that a loss is reasonably possible, the Company is unable to estimate the amount or range of reasonably possible loss in excess of amounts reserved due to the inherent difficulty of predicting the outcome of and uncertainties regarding such litigation and legal proceedings. The Companys assessments are based on estimates and assumptions that have been deemed reasonable by management, but that may prove to be incomplete or inaccurate, and unanticipated events and circumstances may occur that might cause the Company to change those estimates and assumptions. Therefore, it is possible that an unfavorable resolution of one or more pending litigation or other contingencies could have a material adverse effect on the Companys consolidated financial statements in a future fiscal period. Managements assessment of current litigation and other legal proceedings, including the corresponding accruals, could change because of the discovery of facts with respect to legal actions or other proceedings pending against the Company which are not presently known. Adverse rulings or determinations by judges, juries, governmental authorities or other parties could also result in changes to managements assessment of current liabilities and contingencies. Accordingly, the ultimate costs of resolving these claims may be substantially higher or lower than the amounts reserved.- 83 -On December 5 and 12, 2014, putative shareholders filed class actions in federal court in the Northern District of Illinois against the Walgreens Board of Directors, Walgreen Co., and Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. arising out of the Companys definitive proxy statement/prospectus filed with the SEC in connection with the special meeting of Walgreens shareholders on December 29, 2014. The actions assert claims that the definitive proxy statement/prospectus was false or misleading in various respects. On December 23, 2014, solely to avoid the costs, risks and uncertainties inherent in litigation, and without admitting any liability or wrongdoing, Walgreens entered into a memorandum of understanding with the plaintiffs in both actions, pursuant to which Walgreens made certain supplemental disclosures. The proposed settlement is subject to, among other things, court approval. On July 8, 2015, the Court preliminarily approved the settlement and set the final approval hearing for November 6, 2015. On September 22, 2015, the Court adjourned the final approval hearing set for November 6, 2015, and reset the final approval hearing to November 20, 2015.On December 29, 2014, a putative shareholder filed a derivative action in federal court in the Northern District of Illinois against certain current and former directors and officers of Walgreen Co., and Walgreen Co. as a nominal defendant, arising out of certain public statements the Company made regarding its former fiscal 2016 goals. The action asserts claims for breach of fiduciary duty, waste and unjust enrichment. On April 10, 2015, the defendants filed a motion to dismiss. On May 18, 2015, the case was stayed in light of the securities class action that was filed on April 10, 2015, which is described below.On April 10, 2015, a putative shareholder filed a securities class action in federal court in the Northern District of Illinois against Walgreen Co. and certain former officers of Walgreen Co. The action asserts claims for violation of the federal securities laws arising out of certain public statements the Company made regarding its former fiscal 2016 goals. On June 16, 2015, the Court entered an order appointing a lead plaintiff. Pursuant to the Courts order, lead plaintiff filed an amended complaint on August 17, 2015, and defendants moved to dismiss the amended complaint on October 16, 2015.14. Income Taxes The components of Earnings Before Income Tax Provision were (in millions):##TABLE_START   2015  2014  2013 U.S. $2,725  $3,386  $3,469 Non  U.S.  2,586   171   578 Total $5,311  $3,557  $4,047 ##TABLE_END The provision for income taxes consists of the following (in millions):##TABLE_START   2015  2014  2013 Current provision      Federal $  $1,207  $1,122 State  121   109   134 Non  U.S.  128   35   15    1,095   1,351   1,271 Deferred provision            Federal  (23)  183   228 State  (16)  (3)  (2)Non  U.S.  -   (5)  2    (39)  175   228 Income tax provision $1,056  $1,526  $1,499 ##TABLE_END - 84 -The difference between the statutory federal income tax rate and the effective tax rate is as follows:##TABLE_START   2015  2014  2013 Federal statutory rate  35.0%  35.0%  35.0%State income taxes, net of federal benefit  1.3   1.9   2.2 Loss on Alliance Boots call option (1)   -   8.5   - Deferred tax asset recognition (1)   (4.1)  -   - Gain on previously held equity interest  (5.8)  -   - Foreign income taxed at non-U.S. rates  (6.2)  (3.1)  (0.3)Non-taxable income  (2.6)  -   - Non-deductible expenses  2.3   0.3   1.0 Other  -   0.3   (0.9)Effective income tax rate  19.9%  42.9%  37.0%##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START (1) Upon the amendment and immediate exercise of the call option to acquire the remaining 55% ownership of Alliance Boots, the Company was required to compare the fair value of the amended option with the book value of the original option with a gain or loss recognized for the difference. The fair value of the amended option resulted in a financial statement loss of $866 million. The loss on the Alliance Boots call option was, in part, a capital loss and available to be carried forward and offset future capital gains through fiscal 2020. The loss was also the primary contributor to the 2014 valuation allowance amount reported in the deferred income tax table below. In 2015, the deferred tax asset related to the loss was recognized, resulting in the 4.1% effective tax rate benefit reported in the table above as well as a reduction to the valuation allowance amount reported in the deferred income tax table below.##TABLE_END The deferred tax assets and liabilities included in the Consolidated Balance Sheets consist of the following (in millions):##TABLE_START   2015  2014 Deferred tax assets    Postretirement benefits $  $ Compensation and benefits  224   166 Insurance  68   98 Accrued rent  167   166 Outside basis difference  73   - Bad debts  67   65 Tax attributes  341   430 Stock compensation  119   131 Other  93   75    1,282   1,378 Less: Valuation allowance  125   223 Total deferred tax assets  1,157   1,155 Deferred tax liabilities        Accelerated depreciation  1,234   1,244 Inventory  420   407 Intangible assets  1,822   64 Equity method investment  333   387 Deferred income  889   208    4,698   2,310 Net deferred tax liabilities $3,541  $1,155 ##TABLE_END At August 31, 2015, the Company has recorded deferred tax assets of $341 million, primarily reflecting the benefit of $399 million in U.S. federal, $478 million in state and $476 million in non-U.S. ordinary and capital losses. Of these deferred tax assets, $218 million will expire at various dates from 2016 through 2034. The residual deferred tax assets of $123 million have no expiry date.- 85 -The Company believes it is more likely than not that the benefit from certain deferred tax assets will not be realized. In recognition of this risk, the Company has recorded a valuation allowance of $125 million against those deferred tax assets as of August 31, 2015.Income taxes paid were $1.3 billion, $1.2 billion and $1.2 billion for fiscal years 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively.ASC Topic 740, Income Taxes, provides guidance regarding the recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure in the financial statements of tax positions taken or expected to be taken on a tax return, including the decision whether to file in a particular jurisdiction. As of August 31, 2015, unrecognized tax benefits of $224 million were reported as long-term liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets while $73 million were reported as current tax liabilities. Both of these amounts include interest and penalties, when applicable.The following table provides a reconciliation of the total amounts of unrecognized tax benefits (in millions):##TABLE_START   2015  2014  2013 Balance at beginning of year $  $  $ Gross increases related to business combination  84   -   - Gross increases related to tax positions in a prior period  45   55   18 Gross decreases related to tax positions in a prior period  (75)  (82)  (32)Gross increases related to tax positions in the current period  63   46   30 Settlements with taxing authorities  (45)  (22)  (2)Lapse of statute of limitations  (4)  (12)  (3)Balance at end of year $  $  $ ##TABLE_END At August 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, $227 million, $105 million and $116 million, respectively, of unrecognized tax benefits would favorably impact the effective tax rate if recognized. During the next twelve months, based on current knowledge, it is reasonably possible the amount of unrecognized tax benefits could decrease by up to $73 million due to anticipated tax audit settlements and the expirations of statutes of limitations associated with tax positions related to multiple tax jurisdictions.The Company recognizes interest and penalties in the income tax provision in its Consolidated Statements of Earnings. At August 31, 2015, and August 31, 2014, the Company had accrued interest and penalties of $36 million and $21 million, respectively. For the year ended August 31, 2015, the amount reported in income tax expense related to interest and penalties was $3 million.The Company files a consolidated U.S. federal income tax return as well as income tax returns in various states and multiple foreign jurisdictions. It is generally no longer under audit examination for U.S. federal income tax purposes for any years prior to fiscal 2014. With few exceptions, it is no longer subject to state and local income tax examinations by tax authorities for years before fiscal 2007. In foreign tax jurisdictions, the Company is generally no longer subject to examination by the tax authorities in Luxembourg prior to 2010, in Germany prior to 2011, in France prior to 2009, and in Turkey prior to 2010. With respect to the United Kingdom, a number of specific issues remain open to examination by the tax authorities back to 2000.The Company has received tax holidays from Swiss cantonal income taxes relative to certain of its Swiss operations. The income tax holidays are expected to extend through September 2022. The holidays had a beneficial impact of approximately $89 million during 2015. This benefit is primarily included as part of the foreign income taxed at non-U.S. rates line in the effective tax rate reconciliation table above.At August 31, 2015, it is not practicable for the Company to determine the amount of the unrecognized deferred tax liability it has with respect to temporary differences related to investments in foreign subsidiaries and foreign corporate joint ventures that are essentially permanent in duration.15. Stock Compensation Plans The Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. Omnibus Incentive Plan (the Omnibus Plan) which became effective in fiscal 2013, provides for incentive compensation to the Companys non-employee directors, officers and employees, and consolidates into a single plan several previously existing equity compensation plans. A total of 60.4 million shares became available for delivery under the Omnibus Plan.- 86 -In connection with the Reorganization, the Omnibus Plan was assumed by the Company and each Walgreens stock option, restricted stock unit award, performance share award, deferred stock unit award, and share of common stock converted automatically into an award with respect to the number of shares of common stock of the Company on a one-for-one basis. The Companys awards continue to be subject to the same terms and conditions as those that were applicable to such award immediately prior to their conversion. The Company did not record any incremental compensation expense related to the conversion.A summary of the equity awards authorized and available for future grants under the Omnibus Plan follows:##TABLE_START Available for future grants at August 31, 2014  48,352,242 Newly authorized options  - Granted  (8,649,296)Cancellation and forfeitures  5,059,061 Plan termination  1,409,063 Available for future grants at August 31, 2015  46,171,070 ##TABLE_END A summary of the Companys stock options outstanding under the Omnibus Plan follows:##TABLE_START Options Shares  Weighted Average Exercise Price  Weighted Average Remaining Contractual Term (Years)  Aggregate Intrinsic Value (in millions) Outstanding at August 31, 2014  31,916,824  $39.28   6.40  $ Granted  4,119,972   64.19         Exercised  (10,007,975)  35.22         Expired/Forfeited  (3,754,248)  53.72         Outstanding at August 31, 2015  22,274,573   43.52   6.29   959 Vested or expected to vest at August 31, 2015  21,879,917   43.20   6.25   948 Exercisable at August 31, 2015  8,825,638   32.42   4.03   478 ##TABLE_END The fair value of each option grant was determined using the Black-Scholes option pricing model with the following weighted-average assumptions used in fiscal 2015, 2014 and 2013:##TABLE_START   2015  2014  2013 Risk-free interest rate (1)   1.97%  1.98%  1.15%Average life of option (years) (2)   6.6   6.9   7.0 Volatility (3)   25.58%  26.27%  24.94%Dividend yield (4)   1.79%  2.48%  2.44%Weighted-average grant-date fair value $14.62  $12.88  $6.75 ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START (1) Represents the U.S. Treasury security rates for the expected term of the option.##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START (2) Represents the period of time that options granted are expected to be outstanding.

The total fair value of options vested in fiscal 2015, 2014 and 2013 was $54 million, $58 million and $51 million, respectively.Cash received from the exercise of options in fiscal 2015 was $352 million compared to $490 million in the prior year. The related tax benefit realized was $159 million in fiscal 2015 compared to $130 million in the prior year.- 87 -The Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. Employees Stock Purchase Plan permits eligible employees to purchase common stock at 90% of the fair market value at the date of purchase. Employees may make purchases by cash or payroll deductions up to certain limits. The aggregate number of shares that may be purchased under this plan is 94 million. At August 31, 2015, 14 million shares were available for future purchase.Restricted performance shares issued under the Omnibus Plan offer performance-based incentive awards and equity-based awards to key employees. Restricted stock units are also equity-based awards with performance requirements that are granted to key employees. The restricted performance shares and restricted stock unit awards are both subject to restrictions as to continuous employment except in the case of death, normal retirement or total and permanent disability. In accordance with ASC Topic 718, Compensation  Stock Compensation, compensation expense is recognized based on the market price of the Companys common stock on the grant date and is recognized on a straight-line basis over the employees vesting period or to the employees retirement eligible date, if earlier.A summary of information relative to the Companys restricted stock units follows:##TABLE_START Outstanding Shares Shares  Weighted-Average Grant-Date Fair Value Outstanding at August 31, 2014  3,280,067  $45.40 Granted  1,157,312   66.26 Dividends  64,796   - Forfeited  (636,244)  52.68 Vested  (531,479)  52.29 Outstanding at August 31, 2015  3,334,452  $50.85 ##TABLE_END Unless otherwise noted, the fair value of each performance share granted assumes that performance goals will be achieved at 100 percent.

Each director receives an equity grant of shares every year on November 1. In fiscal 2013, the number of shares granted to each director was determined by dividing $ 170 ,000 by the price of a share of common stock on November 1, 2012.  In fiscal 2014 and 2015, the number of shares granted to each director was determined by dividing $175,000 by the price of a share of common stock on November 1, 2013 and November 1, 2014, respectively. Each nonemployee director may elect to receive this annual share grant in the form of shares or deferred stock units. In fiscal 2015, there were 2,725 shares granted to nonemployee directors compared to 2,892 shares and 4,789 shares in fiscal 2014 and 2013, respectively. New directors in any fiscal year earned a prorated amount. Payment of the annual retainer is paid in the form of cash, which may be deferred.

Retirement Benefits The Company sponsors several retirement plans, including defined benefit plans, defined contribution plans and a postretirement health plan. Pursuant to the Second Step Transaction, the Company assumed a number of retirement benefit plans in the United Kingdom and other countries. The Company valued the assumed pension assets and liabilities on the acquisition date and uses an August 31 annual measurement date for its pension and post-retirement plans.Defined Benefit Pension Plans (non-U.S. plans)The principal defined benefit pension plan is the Boots Pension Plan covering certain employees in the United Kingdom (the Boots Plan). The Boots Plan is a funded final salary defined benefit plan providing pensions and death benefits to members. The Boots Plan was closed to future accrual effective July 1, 2010 with pensions calculated based on salaries up until that date. The Boots Plan is governed by a trustee board, which is independent of the Company. The plan is subject to a full funding actuarial valuation on a triennial basis. The Company also has two smaller defined benefit plans in the United Kingdom, both of which were closed to future accruals effective July 1, 2010.  Other defined benefit pension plans include smaller plans in Germany and France . The obligation related to the Companys pension plans was acquired as a result of the Second Step Transaction . The pension costs presented for 2015 represent the costs for the period from December 31, 2014 through August 31, 2015. Prior to December 31, 2014, Alliance Boots was accounted for as an equity method investee and as such, pension costs were included for fiscal 2013, 2014 and fiscal 2015 prior to the date of the Second Step Transaction within Equity earnings in Alliance Boots.Defined benefit pension plan assets were invested in the following classes of securities as of August 31, 2015:##TABLE_START   Percentage of Fair Market Value Equity securities  9.5%Debt securities  81.5%Real estate  5.6%Other  3.4%##TABLE_END The investment strategy of the principal defined benefit pension plan is to hold approximately 85% of its assets in a diverse portfolio of high quality bonds with the remainder invested in equity and real estate assets backing longer term liabilities. Interest rate and inflation rate swaps are also employed to complement the role of fixed and index-linked bond holdings in liability risk management.The following table presents defined benefit pension plan assets using the fair value hierarchy as of August 31, 2015 (in millions).##TABLE_START   August 31, 2015  Level 1  Level 2  Level 3 Equity securities:        Equity securities (1) $  $-  $  $-                  Debt securities:                Fixed interest government bonds (2)  267   -   267   - Index linked government bonds (2)  1,006   -   1,006   - Corporate bonds (3)  5,535   -   5,535   - Other bonds (4)  472   -   472   -                  Real estate:                Real estate (5)  502   -   -   502                  Other:                Other investments (6)  302   25   275   2                  Total $8,936  $  $8,407  $ ##TABLE_END - 89 -##TABLE_START (1) Equity securities, which mainly comprise investments in comingled funds, are valued based on quoted prices and are primarily exchange-traded.

Based on current actuarial estimates, the Company plans to make contributions of $75 million to its defined benefit pension plans in fiscal 2016 and expects to make contributions beyond 2016, which will vary based upon many factors, including the performance of the Companys pension investments.Defined Contribution PlansThe principal retirement plan for U.S. employees is the Walgreen Profit-Sharing Retirement Trust, to which both the Company and participating employees contribute. The Companys contribution, which has historically related to adjusted FIFO earnings before interest and taxes and a portion of which is in the form of a guaranteed match, is determined annually at the discretion of the Board of Directors. The profit-sharing provision was an expense of $158 million, $355 and $342 million in fiscal 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. The Companys contributions were $249 million, $328 million and $262 million in fiscal 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. Following the Second Step Transaction , the Company also assumed certain contract based defined contribution arrangements. The principal one is the Alliance Boots Retirement Savings Plan, which is United Kingdom based and to which both the Company and participating employees contribute. The cost related to these arrangements recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings from the date of the Second Step Transaction through August 31, 2015 was $93 million.Postretirement Healthcare PlanThe Company provides certain health insurance benefits to retired U.S. employees who meet eligibility requirements, including age, years of service and date of hire. The costs of these benefits are accrued over the service life of the employee. The Companys postretirement health benefit plan is not funded.Components of net periodic benefit costs (in millions):##TABLE_START   2015  2014  2013 Service cost $  $  $ Interest cost  17   17   14 Amortization of actuarial loss  19   11   12 Amortization of prior service cost  (24)  (23)  (22)Total postretirement benefit cost $  $  $ ##TABLE_END Change in benefit obligation (in millions):##TABLE_START   2015  2014 Benefit obligation at September 1 $  $ Service cost  11   8 Interest cost  17   17 Amendments  (27)  (23)Actuarial loss (gain)  17   88 Benefits paid  (21)  (19)Participants contributions  7   6 Benefit obligation at August 31 $  $ ##TABLE_END - 92 -Change in plan assets (in millions):##TABLE_START   2015  2014 Plan assets at fair value at September 1 $-  $- Participants contributions  7   6 Employer contributions  14   13 Benefits paid  (21)  (19)Plan assets at fair value at August 31 $-  $- ##TABLE_END Funded status (in millions):##TABLE_START   2015  2014 Funded status at August 31 $(431) $(427)##TABLE_END Amounts recognized in the Consolidated Balance Sheets (in millions):##TABLE_START   2015  2014 Current liabilities (present value of expected net benefit payments) $(12) $(11)Non-current liabilities  (419)  (416)Net liability recognized at August 31 $(431) $(427)##TABLE_END Amounts recognized in accumulated other comprehensive (income) loss (in millions):##TABLE_START   2015  2014 Prior service credit $(231) $(228)Net actuarial loss  223   225 ##TABLE_END Amounts expected to be recognized as components of net periodic costs for fiscal year 2016 (in millions):##TABLE_START   2016 Prior service credit $(27)Net actuarial loss  19 ##TABLE_END The discount rate assumption used to compute the postretirement benefit obligation at year-end was 4.78% for 2015, and 4.40% for 2014.

Capital Stock In connection with the Companys capital policy, the Board of Directors has authorized share repurchase programs. In August 2014, the Companys Board of Directors authorized the 2014 stock repurchase program which authorizes the repurchase of up to $3.0 billion of the Companys common stock prior to its expiration on August 31, 2016. The Company purchased 8.2 million shares under the 2014 stock repurchase program in fiscal 2015 at a cost of $726 million.The Company determines the timing and amount of repurchases based on its assessment of various factors including prevailing market conditions, alternate uses of capital, liquidity, the economic environment and other factors. The timing and amount of these purchases may change at any time and from time to time. The Company has repurchased, and may from time to time in the future repurchase, shares on the open market through Rule 10b5-1 plans, which enable a company to repurchase shares at times when it otherwise might be precluded from doing so under insider trading laws.In addition, the Company continued to repurchase shares to support the needs of the employee stock plans. Shares totaling $500 million were purchased to support the needs of the employee stock plans during fiscal 2015 as compared to $705 million in fiscal 2014. At August 31, 2015, 46.2 million shares of common stock were reserved for future issuances under the Companys various employee benefit plans.18.

Segment Reporting Prior to December 31, 2014, the Companys operations were within one reportable segment. As a result of the closing of the Second Step Transaction on December 31, 2014, (see Note 1, Organization, and Note 2, Summary of Major Accounting Policies), the Company has realigned its operations into three reportable segments: Retail Pharmacy USA, Retail Pharmacy International and Pharmaceutical Wholesale. The operating segments have been identified based on the financial data utilized by the Companys Chief Executive Officer (the chief operating decision maker) to assess segment performance and allocate resources among the Companys operating segments , which have been aggregated as described below . The chief operating decision maker uses adjusted operating income to assess segment profitability. The chief operating decision maker does not use total assets by segment to make decisions regarding resources, therefore the total asset disclosure by segment has not been included.##TABLE_START  The Retail Pharmacy USA segment consists of the legacy Walgreens business, which includes the operation of retail drugstores and convenient care clinics, in addition to providing specialty pharmacy services. Revenues for the segment are principally derived from the sale of prescription drugs and a wide assortment of general merchandise, including non-prescription drugs, beauty products, photo finishing, seasonal merchandise, greeting cards and convenience foods. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  The Retail Pharmacy International segment consists primarily of the legacy Alliance Boots pharmacy-led health and beauty stores, optical practices, and related contract manufacturing operations. Stores are located in the United Kingdom, Mexico, Chile, Thailand, Norway, the Republic of Ireland, The Netherlands and Lithuania. Revenues for the segment are principally derived from the sale of prescription drugs and retail health, beauty, toiletries and other consumer products. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  The Pharmaceutical Wholesale segment consists of the legacy Alliance Boots pharmaceutical wholesaling and distribution businesses. Wholesale operations are located in France, United Kingdom, Germany, Turkey, Spain, Russia, The Netherlands, Egypt, Norway, Romania, Czech Republic and Lithuania. Revenues for the segment are principally derived from wholesaling and distribution of a comprehensive offering of brand-name pharmaceuticals (including specialty pharmaceutical products) and generic pharmaceuticals, health and beauty products, home healthcare supplies and equipment, and related services to pharmacies and other healthcare providers. ##TABLE_END The accounting policies of the segments are in accordance with Note 2, Summary of Major Accounting Policies.The results of operations for each reportable segment include synergy benefits, including WBAD operations and an allocation of corporate-related overhead costs. The Eliminations and Unallocated Items column contains items not allocable to the reportable segments, as the information is not utilized by the chief operating decision maker to assess segment performance and allocate resources.The segment information for fiscal 2015 reflects the operating results of the Companys new business segments. The Company began recording revenue and expense transactions using the new segments effective January 1, 2015. Beginning January 1, 2015, synergy benefits including WBAD operations have been allocated to the Retail Pharmacy USA, Retail Pharmacy International and Pharmaceutical Wholesale segments on a source of procurement benefit basis. Under this method, the synergy benefits are allocated to the segment whose purchase gave rise to the benefit. A synergy arising on the purchase of an item for use in the Retail Pharmacy USA segment is recognized in the Retail Pharmacy USA segment and similarly for the Retail Pharmacy International and Pharmaceutical Wholesale segments. Procurement service income related to third parties is recognized in the Pharmaceutical Wholesale segment. Corporate costs have been allocated to segments based on their respective gross profit.The Company has determined that it is impracticable to restate segment information for fiscal 2014 and 2013, as well as to provide disclosures under both the old basis and new basis of reporting for certain items. Specifically, WBAD operations historically have been recorded in the Retail Pharmacy USA segment and not restated as it is impracticable to separate the information to the individual reportable segments. Equity earnings from Alliance Boots prior to the completion of the Second Step Transaction have been recorded within the Retail Pharmacy USA segment. The equity earnings of the 45% interest in Alliance Boots have not been separated into the Retail Pharmacy International and Pharmaceutical Wholesale segments for the prior periods as it is impracticable. Additionally, comparative information has not been restated to reflect the 45% equity interest in Alliance Boots.- 95 -The following table reflects results of operations of the Companys reportable segments (in millions):##TABLE_START   Retail Pharmacy         USA  International  Pharmaceutical Wholesale  Eliminations and Unallocated Items  Consolidated For the Year Ended August 31, 2015           Sales to external customers $80,974  $8,657  $13,813  $-  $103,444 Intersegment sales  -   124   1,514   (1,638)  - Total Sales $80,974  $8,781  $15,327  $(1,638) $103,444                      Adjusted Operating Income $5,098  $  $  $(7) $6,157                      Depreciation and amortization $1,217  $  $  $  $1,742 Additions to property, plant and equipment  951   249   51   -   1,251                      For the Year Ended August 31, 2014                     Sales to external customers $76,392  $-  $-  $-  $76,392 Intersegment sales  -   -   -   -   - Total Sales  76,392   -   -   -   76,392                      Adjusted Operating Income $4,866  $-  $-  $-  $4,866                      Depreciation and amortization $1,316  $-  $-  $-  $1,316 Additions to property, plant and equipment  1,106   -   -   -   1,106                      For the Year Ended August 31, 2013                     Sales to external customers $72,217  $-  $-  $-  $72,217 Intersegment sales  -   -   -   -   - Total Sales  72,217   -   -   -   72,217                      Adjusted Operating Income $4,828  $-  $-  $-  $4,828                      Depreciation and amortization $1,283  $-  $-  $-  $1,283 Additions to property, plant and equipment  1,212   -   -   -   1,212 ##TABLE_END - 96 -The following table reconciles adjusted operating income to operating income (in millions):##TABLE_START   Retail Pharmacy         USA  International  Pharmaceutical Wholesale  Eliminations and Unallocated Items  Consolidated For the Year Ended August 31, 2015          Adjusted Operating Income $5,098  $  $  $(7) $6,157 Cost transformation                  (542)Acquisition-related amortization                  (515)LIFO provision                  (285)Asset impairment                  (110)Acquisition-related costs                  (87)Store closures and other optimization costs                  (56)Loss on sale of business                  (17)Increase in fair market value of warrants                  123 Operating Income                 $4,668                      For the Year Ended August 31, 2014                    Adjusted Operating Income $4,866  $-  $-  $-  $4,866 Acquisition-related amortization                  (364)LIFO provision                  (132)Store closure and other optimization costs                  (271)Acquisition-related costs                  (82)Increase in fair market value of warrants                  168 Gain on sale of business                  9 Operating Income                 $4,194                      For the Year Ended August 31, 2013                    Adjusted Operating Income $4,828  $-  $-  $-  $4,828 Acquisition-related amortization                  (394)LIFO provision                  (239)Acquisition-related costs                  (96)Hurricane Sandy costs                  (39)DEA settlement costs                  (28)Distributor transition costs                  (13)Gain on sale of business                  20 Increase in fair market value of warrants                  53 Operating Income                 $4,092 ##TABLE_END No single customer accounted for more than 10% of the Companys consolidated net sales for any of the periods presented.

Subsequent Event On October 27, 2015, the Company entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger with Rite Aid Corporation (Rite Aid) and Victoria Merger Sub, Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company (the Merger Agreement), pursuant to which the Company agreed, subject to the terms and conditions thereof, to acquire Rite Aid, a drugstore chain in the United States with 4,561 stores in 31 states and the District of Columbia as of August 29, 2015. On the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement, Rite Aid will become a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company and Rite Aid stockholders will be entitled to receive $9.00 in cash for each outstanding share of Rite Aid common stock, for a total enterprise value of approximately $17.2 billion, including acquired net debt. The transaction is expected to close in the second half of calendar 2016, subject to Rite Aid stockholder approval, regulatory approvals and other customary closing conditions.We intend to finance the acquisition through a combination of cash on hand and debt financing. Concurrently with the signing of the Merger Agreement, the Company entered into a bridge facility commitment letter (the Commitment Letter), dated October 27, 2015, with UBS Securities LLC and UBS AG, Stamford Branch for a $12.8 billion senior unsecured bridge facility (the Facility). The Facility, if funded, will mature 364 days after the initial borrowings; provided that the Company can extend up to $3.0 billion of the Facility for an additional 90 day period if desired. The interest rate applicable to borrowings under the Facility will be LIBOR or the applicable base rate plus a margin. The financing commitments of the lenders are subject to certain customary conditions set forth in the Commitment Letter. We expect to obtain permanent financing for the transaction prior to the closing date, which would replace the Facility.Managements Report on Internal Control Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f). Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the framework in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). Based on our evaluation, management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of August 31, 2015. Deloitte  Touche LLP, the Companys independent registered public accounting firm, has audited our internal control over financial reporting, as stated in its report which is included herein.As described in Note 8, Acquisitions to the consolidated financial statements, we acquired a controlling interest in Alliance Boots GmbH and its subsidiaries (Alliance Boots) upon the closing of the Second Step Transaction on December 31, 2014. The scope of managements evaluation of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting did not include the internal controls of Alliance Boots. This exclusion is in accordance with the SEC Staffs general guidance that an assessment of a recent business combination may be omitted from managements report on internal control over financial reporting in the year of consolidation. Alliance Boots represented approximately 49.2% of the Companys total assets as of August 31, 2015 and 21.7% of the Companys net sales for the year ended August 31, 2015.##TABLE_START /s/Stefano Pessina /s/George R.

(successor to Walgreen Co.) and subsidiaries (the Company) as of August 31, 2015 and 2014, and the related consolidated statements of earnings, comprehensive income, equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended August 31, 2015. These financial statements are the responsibility of the Companys management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits. For the years ended August 31, 2014 and 2013, we did not audit the consolidated financial statements of Alliance Boots GmbH (Alliance Boots), the Companys investment in which was accounted for by use of the equity method (see note 6 to the consolidated financial statements). The accompanying 2014 and 2013 consolidated financial statements of the Company include its equity investment in Alliance Boots of $7,336 million as of August 31, 2014, and its equity earnings in Alliance Boots of $617 million and $496 million for the years ended August 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. The consolidated financial statements of Alliance Boots as of May 31, 2014 and for the year ended May 31, 2014 and for the ten months ended May 31, 2013, prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board, were audited by other auditors whose report has been furnished to us, and our opinion, insofar as it relates to the amounts included for the Companys equity investment and equity earnings in Alliance Boots, on the basis of International Financial Reporting Standards as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board, is based on the report of the other auditors. We have applied auditing procedures to the adjustments to reflect the Companys equity investment and equity earnings in Alliance Boots in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America and auditing procedures to take into consideration the differences in reporting periods between Alliance Boots and the Company.We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits and the report of the other auditors provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.In our opinion, based on our audits and the report of the other auditors, such consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. and subsidiaries as of August 31, 2015 and 2014, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended August 31, 2015, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.As discussed in Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company has elected to change its method of accounting for its equity investment and equity earnings in Alliance Boots to eliminate the three month reporting lag as of August 31, 2014 and for the years ended August 31, 2014 and 2013.We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the Companys internal control over financial reporting as of August 31, 2015, based on the criteria established in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated October 28, 2015 expressed an unqualified opinion on the Companys internal control over financial reporting based on our audit./s/ DELOITTE  TOUCHE LLPChicago, IllinoisOctober 28, 2015- 100 -To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc.:We have audited the internal control over financial reporting of Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. (successor to Walgreen Co.) and subsidiaries (the Company) as of August 31, 2015 based on criteria established in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. As described in Managements Report on Internal Control, management excluded from its assessment the internal control over financial reporting at Alliance Boots GmbH and its subsidiaries (Alliance Boots), in which the Company acquired a controlling interest on December 31, 2014, at which time Alliance Boots became wholly-owned. Alliance Boots represented approximately 49.2 % and 21.7 % of the Companys total assets and net sales , respectively, as of and for the year ended August 31, 2015. Accordingly, our audit did not include the internal control over financial reporting at Alliance Boots. The Companys management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Managements Report on Internal Control. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Companys internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.A companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the companys principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, and effected by the companys board of directors, management, and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.Because of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting, including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Also, projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of August 31, 2015, based on the criteria established in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended August 31, 2015 of the Company and our report dated October 28, 2015 expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements and includes an explanatory paragraph on a change in accounting method for equity investment and equity earnings in Alliance Boots GmbH to eliminate the three month reporting lag used prior to December 31, 2014./s/ DELOITTE  TOUCHE LLPChicago, IllinoisOctober 28, 2015- 101 -To the Board of Alliance Boots GmbH:We have audited the non-statutory consolidated financial statements of Alliance Boots GmbH and its subsidiaries (the Group, not presented separately herein), which comprise the Group statements of financial position as at 31 May 2014 and 2013, and the related Group income statements, Group statements of comprehensive income, Group statements of changes in equity and Group statements of cash flows for the year ended 31 May 2014 and ten months ended 31 May 2013.

Controls and Procedures Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and ProceduresManagement conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this Form 10-K. The controls evaluation was conducted under the supervision and with the participation of the Companys management, i ncluding its Chief Executive Officer (CEO) and Chief Financial Officer (CFO). Upon completion of the Second Step Transaction on December 31, 2014, Alliance Boots became a consolidated subsidiary and ceased being accounted for under the equity method. As this occurred during fiscal 2015, the scope of managements assessment of the effectiveness of the Companys disclosure controls and procedures did not include the internal controls over financial reporting of Alliance Boots. This exclusion is in accordance with the SEC Staffs general guidance that an assessment of a recently acquired business may be omitted from the scope of managements assessment for one year following the acquisition. Based upon the controls evaluation, our CEO and CFO have concluded that, as of the e nd of the period covered by this report, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in our Exchange Act reports is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified by the SEC, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to management, including the CEO and CFO, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Report on Internal Control Over Financial ReportingManagements report on internal control over financial reporting and the report of Deloitte  Touche LLP, the Companys independent registered public accounting firm, related to their assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting are included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K and are incorporated in this Item 9A by reference.- 102 -Changes in Internal Control over Financial ReportingIn connection with the evaluation pursuant to Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(d) of the Companys internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f)) by the C ompanys management, including its CEO and CFO, except as noted below, no changes during the quarter ended August 31, 2015 were identified that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Companys internal control over financial reporting. As a result of the closing of the Second Step Transaction, the Company has incorporated internal controls over significant processes specific to the acquisition that it believes to be appropriate and necessary in consideration of the level of related integration. As the post-closing integration continues, the Company will continue to review the internal controls and processes of Alliance Boots and may take further steps to integrate such controls and processes with those of the Company.Inherent Limitations on Effectiveness of ControlsOur management, including the CEO and CFO, do not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent or detect all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the control systems objectives will be met. The design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Further, because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that misstatements due to error or fraud will not occur or that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the Company have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake. Controls can also be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people, or by management override of the controls. The design of any system of controls is based in part on certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. Projections of any evaluation of controls effectiveness to future periods are subject to risks. Over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or deterioration in the degree of compliance with policies or procedures.", "9B": " Item 9B.

We seek to further drive innovative ways to address global health and wellness challenges. We believe we are well positioned to expand customer offerings in existing markets and become a health and wellbeing partner of choice in emerging markets.Walgreens Boots Alliance was incorporated in Delaware in 2014 and, as described below, is the successor of Walgreen Co., an Illinois corporation, which was formed in 1909 as a successor to a business founded in 1901. Our principal executive offices are located at 108 Wilmot Road, Deerfield, Illinois 60015. Our common stock trades on the NASDAQ Stock Market under the symbol WBA.Recent Transactions On March 18, 2016, we exercised warrants to purchase 22,696,912 shares of AmerisourceBergen Corporation (AmerisourceBergen) common stock at an exercise price of $51.50 per share for an aggregate exercise price payment of $1.17 billion. On August 25, 2016, we exercised additional warrants to purchase 22,696,912 shares of AmerisourceBergen common stock at an exercise price of $52.50 per share for an aggregate exercise price payment of $1.19 billion. Following the August 25, 2016 warrant exercise, we do not hold any further warrants to purchase shares of AmerisourceBergen common stock. As of August 31, 2016, we owned 56,854,867 AmerisourceBergen common shares representing approximately 24% of the outstanding AmerisourceBergen common stock and had designated one member of AmerisourceBergens board of directors. As of August 31, 2016, we can acquire up to an additional 8,398,752 AmerisourceBergen shares in the open market and thereafter designate a second member of AmerisourceBergens board of directors, subject in each case to applicable legal and contractual requirements. The amount of permitted open market purchases is subject to increase or decrease in certain circumstances.Effective March 18, 2016, we account for our investment in AmerisourceBergen using the equity method of accounting, subject to a two-month reporting lag, with the net earnings attributable to our investment being classified within the operating income of our Pharmaceutical Wholesale segment. See Note 5, Equity Method Investments, to the Consolidated Financial Statements included herein for further information. Due to the March 18, 2016 effective date and the two-month reporting lag, our results for the 12 month period ended August 31, 2016 include approximately three and a half months of equity method income relating to our investment in AmerisourceBergen. Similarly, due to the timing of the warrant exercise and the two month reporting lag, our results for the fiscal quarter ended November 30, 2016 will include approximately five weeks of equity income reflecting our increased ownership following the exercise on August 25, 2016 of the second tranche of warrants.On December 31, 2014, Walgreens Boots Alliance became the successor of Walgreens pursuant to a merger to effect a reorganization of Walgreens into a holding company structure, with Walgreens Boots Alliance becoming the parent holding company. Pursuant to the Reorganization, Walgreens became a wholly owned subsidiary of Walgreens Boots Alliance, which was formed for the purposes of the Reorganization, and each issued and outstanding share of Walgreens common stock converted on a one-to-one basis into Walgreens Boots Alliance common stock. Also on December 31, 2014, following the completion of the Reorganization, Walgreens Boots Alliance completed the acquisition of the remaining 55% of Alliance Boots GmbH (Alliance Boots) that Walgreens did not previously own (the Second Step Transaction) in exchange for 3.133 billion in cash and 144.3 million shares of Walgreens Boots Alliance common stock. Alliance Boots became a consolidated subsidiary and ceased being accounted for under the equity method immediately upon completion of the Second Step Transaction. For financial reporting and accounting purposes, Walgreens Boots Alliance was the acquirer of Alliance Boots. The consolidated financial statements (and other data, such as prescriptions filled) reflect the results of operations and financial position of Walgreens and its subsidiaries for periods prior to December 31, 2014 and of Walgreens Boots Alliance and its subsidiaries for periods from and after the effective time of the Reorganization on December 31, 2014.In March 2013, Walgreens, Alliance Boots and AmerisourceBergen announced various agreements and arrangements, including a ten-year pharmaceutical distribution agreement between Walgreens and AmerisourceBergen pursuant to which branded and generic pharmaceutical products are sourced from AmerisourceBergen in the U.S.; and an agreement which provides AmerisourceBergen the ability to access generics pharmaceutical products through Walgreens Boots Alliance Development GmbH (WBAD), the Companys global sourcing enterprise.

We believe the long-term outlook for prescription drug utilization is strong due, in part, to aging populations, increases in life expectancy, increases in the availability and utilization of generic drugs, the continued development of innovative drugs that improve quality of life and control healthcare costs, and increases in the number of persons with insurance coverage for prescription drugs, including, in the United States, the expansion of healthcare insurance coverage under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (the ACA) and baby boomers increasingly becoming eligible for the federally funded Medicare Part D prescription program. Pharmaceutical wholesalers act as a vital link between drug manufacturers and pharmacies and healthcare providers in supplying pharmaceuticals to patients. - 2 - The retail pharmacy industry across the globe relies significantly on private and governmental third party payers. Many private organizations throughout the healthcare industry, including pharmacy benefit management (PBM) companies and health insurance companies, have consolidated in recent years to create larger healthcare enterprises with greater bargaining power. Third party payers, including the Medicare Part D plans and the state-sponsored Medicaid and related managed care Medicaid agencies in the United States, can change eligibility requirements or reduce certain reimbursement rates. In addition, in many European countries, the government provides or subsidizes healthcare to consumers and regulates pharmaceutical prices, patient eligibility, and reimbursement levels to control costs for the government-sponsored healthcare system. Changes in law or regulation also can impact reimbursement rates and terms. For example, the ACA seeks to reduce federal spending by altering the Medicaid reimbursement formula (AMP) for multi-source drugs in the United States and the UK Department of Health plans to implement funding cuts to reduce costs within the National Health Service by reducing drug reimbursement rates. These changes generally are expected to reduce Medicaid reimbursements in the United States and pharmacy reimbursements in the UK . State Medicaid programs are also expected to continue to seek reductions in reimbursements independent of AMP. When third party payers or governmental authorities take actions that restrict eligibility or reduce prices or reimbursement rates, sales and margins in the retail pharmacy industry could be reduced, which would adversely affect industry profitability. In some cases, these possible adverse effects may be partially or entirely offset by controlling inventory costs and other expenses, dispensing more higher margin generics, finding new revenue streams through pharmacy services or other offerings and/or dispensing a greater volume of prescriptions.Generic prescription drugs have continued to help lower overall costs for customers and third party payers. We expect the utilization of generic pharmaceuticals to continue to increase. In general, in the United States, generic versions of drugs generate lower sales dollars per prescription, but higher gross profit dollars, as compared with patent-protected brand name drugs. The positive impact on retail pharmacy gross profit dollars can be significant in the first several months after a generic version of a drug is first allowed to compete with the branded version, which is generally referred to as a generic conversion. In any given year, the number of major brand name drugs that undergo a conversion from branded to generic status can vary and the timing of generic conversions can be difficult to predict, which can have a significant impact on retail pharmacy sales and gross profit dollars. We expect that market demand, government regulation, third-party reimbursement policies, government contracting requirements and other pressures will continue to cause the industries in which we compete to evolve. Pharmacists are on the frontlines of the healthcare delivery system, and we believe rising healthcare costs and the limited supply of primary care physicians present new opportunities for pharmacists and retail pharmacies to play an even greater role in driving positive outcomes for patients and payers through expanded service offerings such as immunizations and other preventive care, healthcare clinics, pharmacist-led medication therapy management and chronic condition management.Segments Our operations are organized into three divisions, which are also our reportable segments: ##TABLE_START  Retail Pharmacy USA;##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  Retail Pharmacy International; and##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  Pharmaceutical Wholesale.##TABLE_END For fiscal 2016, our segment sales were: Retail Pharmacy USA, $83.8 billion; Retail Pharmacy International, $13.3 billion; and Pharmaceutical Wholesale, $22.6 billion. Additional information relating to our segments is included in Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in Part II, Item 7 below and in Note 18, Segment Reporting to our Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 below, which information is incorporated herein by reference.Retail Pharmacy USAOur Retail Pharmacy USA division (excluding equity method investments) has pharmacy-led health and beauty retail offerings in 50 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands, each focused on helping people feel happy and healthy. We operated 8,175 retail stores in the division as of August 31, 2016. Our principal retail pharmacy brands in the division are Walgreens and Duane Reade. We are a market leader in the United States and, as of August 31, 2016, approximately 76% of the population of the United States lived within five miles of a Walgreens or Duane Reade retail pharmacy.We provide customers with convenient, omni-channel access to consumer goods and services, including own branded general merchandise such as NICE!, DeLish TM and Well at Walgreens, as well as pharmacy and health and wellness services in communities across America. Our walgreens .com website receives an average of 58 million visits per month. Integrated with our e-commerce platform, the Walgreens mobile application allows customers to refill prescriptions through scan technology, receive text messages alerting when a refill is due and other retail functionality, such as photo and shopping features.- 3 - Our services help improve health outcomes for patients and manage costs for payers including employers, managed care organizations, health systems, PBM companies and the public sector. We utilize our retail network as a channel to provide health and wellness services to our customers and patients, as illustrated by our ability to play a significant role in providing flu vaccines and other immunizations. We also provide specialty pharmacy services . As of August 31, 2016, we had approximately 400 in-store clinic locations throughout the United States, some of which are operated by the Company and some of which are operated by health system partners. We have more than 76,000 healthcare service providers, including pharmacists, pharmacy technicians, nurse practitioners and other health related professionals.The components of the divisions sales are Pharmacy (the sale of prescription drugs and provision of pharmacy-related services) and Retail (the sale of healthcare and retail products including non-prescription drugs, beauty, toiletries and general merchandise). The divisions sales are subject to the influence of seasonality, particularly the winter holiday and cough, cold and flu seasons. This seasonality also can affect the divisions proportion of sales between Retail and Pharmacy during certain periods. The components of the divisions fiscal year sales were as follows:##TABLE_START   Fiscal 2016  Fiscal 2015  Fiscal 2014 Pharmacy  67%  66%  64%Retail  33%  34%  36%Total  100%  100%  100%##TABLE_END We filled 740.1 million prescriptions (including immunizations) in the division in fiscal 2016. Adjusted to 30-day equivalents, prescriptions filled were 928.5 million in fiscal 2016. Sales where reimbursement is received from managed care organizations, governmental agencies, PBM companies and private insurance were approximately 97% of the divisions fiscal 2016 pharmacy sales.We fill prescriptions for many state Medicaid public assistance programs. Sales from all such Medicaid plans were approximately 4 % of the divisions fiscal 2016 sales . Sales from Medicare Part D plans were approximately 17 % of the divisions fiscal 2016 sales. Our U.S. loyalty program, Balance Rewards, is designed to reward our most valuable customers and encourage shopping in stores and online. Balance Rewards members receive special pricing on select products and earn everyday rewards points for purchasing most merchandise that can be instantly redeemed at our stores or through walgreens.com. As of August 31, 2016, the number of active Balance Rewards members totaled 87.4 million. For this purpose, we define an active member as someone who has used their card in the last six months.AmerisourceBergen supplies and distributes a significant amount of generic and branded pharmaceutical products to the divisions pharmacies. We purchase our non-pharmaceutical merchandise from numerous manufacturers and wholesalers.Our sales, and gross profit are impacted by, among other things, both the percentage of prescriptions that we fill that are generic and the rate at which new generic drugs are introduced to the market. Because any number of factors outside of our control can affect timing for a generic conversion, we face substantial uncertainty in predicting when such conversions will occur and what effect they will have on particular future periods.The current environment of our  pharmacy business also includes ongoing reimbursement pressure and a shift in pharmacy mix towards 90-day at retail (one prescription that is the equivalent of three 30-day prescriptions ) and Medicare Part D prescriptions. Further consolidation among generic manufacturers coupled with changes in the number of major brand name drugs anticipated to undergo a conversion from branded to generic status may also result in gross margin pressures within the industry.We continuously face reimbursement pressure from PBM companies, health maintenance organizations, managed care organizations and other commercial third party payers; our agreements with these payers are regularly subject to expiration, termination or renegotiation. In addition, plan changes with rate adjustments often occur in January and our reimbursement arrangements may provide for rate adjustments at prescribed intervals during their term. We experienced lower reimbursement rates in fiscal 2016 as compared to the same period in the prior year. Further, we accepted lower Medicare Part D reimbursement rates for calendar 2016 compared to calendar 2015 in order to secure preferred relationships with Medicare Part D plans serving senior patients with significant pharmacy needs.We expect this trend to continue. - 4 - We also have worked to develop and expand our relationships with commercial third party payers to enable new and/or improved market access via participation in pharmacy provider networks they offer. The prescription volume impact of new agreements and relationships typically is incremental over time. In fiscal 2017, we anticipate prescription growth to be relatively stronger in the second half of the fiscal year reflecting the timing and development of these strategic relationships . Our 90-day at retail prescription drug offering is typically at a lower margin than comparable 30-day prescriptions, but provides us with the opportunity to increase business with patients with chronic prescription needs while offering increased convenience, helping facilitate improved prescription adherence and resulting in a lower cost to fill the 90-day prescription. Retail Pharmacy InternationalOur Retail Pharmacy International division (excluding equity method investments) has pharmacy-led health and beauty retail businesses in eight countries, each focused on helping people look and feel their best. We operated 4,673 retail stores in the division as of August 31, 2016 (see Properties in Part I, Item 2 below for information regarding geographic coverage), and have grown our online presence significantly in recent years. Our principal retail pharmacy brands are Boots in the United Kingdom, Thailand, Norway, the Republic of Ireland and The Netherlands, Benavides in Mexico and Ahumada in Chile. In Europe, we are a market leader and our retail stores are conveniently located and our pharmacists are well placed to provide a significant role in the provision of healthcare services, working closely with other primary healthcare providers in the communities we serve.The Boots omni-channel offering is differentiated from that of competitors due to the product brands we own, such as No7, Boots Pharmaceuticals, Botanics, Liz Earle, Soap  Glory, and only at Boots exclusive products, together with our long established reputation for trust and customer care. Our brands portfolio is enhanced by our in-house product research and development and manufacturing capabilities.Our retail store networks are typically complemented by online platforms. In the United Kingdom, our transactional website, boots.com, receives on average approximately 20 million visits monthly. Through the boots.com website and integrated mobile application, our order and collect service allows customers to order from a range of over 35,000 products by 8:00 p.m. and collect from noon the following day from approximately 95 % of the United Kingdoms retail stores as of August 31, 2016.The Boots Advantage Card loyalty program, where customers earn points on purchases for redemption at a later date, continues to be a key element of the Boots offering. As of August 31, 2016, the number of active Boots Advantage Card members totaled 15.5 million. For this purpose, we define an active member as someone who has used their card in the last six months.In addition, Boots in the United Kingdom is one of the leaders in the optical market with 636 practices, of which 182 operated on a franchise basis as of August 31, 2016. Approximately 30% of these optical practices are located in Boots stores with the balance being standalone optical practices.The components of the divisions sales are Pharmacy (typically the sale of prescription drugs and provision of pharmacy-related services, subject to variation in particular jurisdictions depending upon regulatory and other factors) and Retail (primarily the sale of health and beauty products including beauty, toiletries and lifestyle merchandising, non-prescription drugs and, in the United Kingdom, the provision of optical services).The divisions sales are subject to the influence of seasonality, with the second fiscal quarter typically the strongest as a result of the winter holiday period. This seasonality affects the divisions proportion of sales between Retail and Pharmacy during certain periods. The components of the divisions fiscal year sales were as follows:##TABLE_START   Fiscal 2016  Fiscal 2015 (1)  Fiscal 2014 Pharmacy  35%  37%NA Retail  65%  63%NA Total  100%  100%NA ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START (1) Fiscal 2015 includes periods subsequent to the Second Step Transaction, for the months of January through August 2015.##TABLE_END - 5 - The divisions Retail sales, gross profit margin and gross profit dollars are impacted by, among other things, the highly competitive nature of the health and beauty category, specifically our and our competitors pricing actions, promotional offers and events and our customers desire for value and convenience.The divisions Pharmacy sales, gross margin and gross profit dollars are impacted by governmental agencies and other third party payers seeking to minimize increases in the costs of healthcare, including pharmaceutical drug reimbursement rates. In the United Kingdom, which is the divisions largest market for Pharmacy sales, the amount of government funding available for pharmacy services is typically reviewed and agreed with the pharmacy industry on an annual basis . In fiscal 2017, the UK Department of Health has indicated that they plan to implement funding cuts to reduce costs within the National Health Service, the publicly-funded healthcare system . In addition, performance as measured in U.S. dollars is impacted by the exchange rates used to translate these amounts into U.S. dollars, the exchange rate of British Pounds Sterling being the most significant.Pharmaceutical WholesaleOur Pharmaceutical Wholesale division (excluding equity method investments), which mainly operates under the Alliance Healthcare brand, supplies medicines, other healthcare products and related services to more than 110,000 pharmacies, doctors, health centers and hospitals each year from 288 distribution centers in 11 countries, primarily in Europe, as of August 31, 2016.The distribution of prescription medicines to pharmacists comprises the vast majority of the divisions sales. Our wholesale businesses seek to provide high core service levels to pharmacists in terms of frequency of delivery, product availability, delivery accuracy, timeliness and reliability at competitive prices. We also offer customers innovative added-value services to help pharmacists develop their own businesses. This includes membership of Alphega Pharmacy, our pan-European network for independent pharmacies, which, as of August 31, 2016, had over 5,700 members.In addition to the wholesale of medicines and other healthcare products, our businesses provide services to pharmaceutical manufacturers who are increasingly seeking to gain greater control over their product distribution, while at the same time outsourcing non-core activities. These services include pre-wholesale and contract logistics (mainly under the Alloga brand), direct deliveries to pharmacies, and innovative and specialized healthcare services, covering clinical homecare, medicine support, dispensing services, medicine preparation and clinical trial support (mainly under the Alcura brand).Combined with local engagement, scale is important in pharmaceutical wholesaling. We are one of the largest pharmaceutical wholesalers and distributors in Europe, and we rank as one of the top three in market share in many of the individual countries in which we operate.Our sales, gross profit margin and gross profit dollars are impacted by, among other things, government actions, which typically seek to reduce the growth in prescription drug consumption, reduce reimbursement rates and increase generic drug utilization. A greater proportion of generic drugs, whether as a result of government actions, generic conversions or other factors, typically has an adverse effect on our revenues. However, in the wholesale division we typically earn equal or better gross margins on generic drugs than on branded drugs, although there are exceptions.Changes in manufacturers product distribution business models also can impact the divisions sales and gross margin. For example, when pharmaceutical drug manufacturers introduce fee-for-service contracts, it reduces our sales even if we are successful in winning these contracts, as we only recognize sales for the amount of the fees charged. Other manufacturer services, including our pre-wholesale and contract logistics operations are typically on a fee-for-service basis.In addition, performance as measured in U.S. dollars is impacted by the exchange rates used to translate these amounts into U.S. dollars, the exchange rate of British Pounds Sterling and the Euro being the most significant. The divisions sales are subject to less seasonality than our other divisions.Intellectual property and licenses We market products and services under various trademarks, trade dress and trade names and rely on a combination of patent, copyright, trademark, service mark, and trade secret laws, as well as contractual restrictions to establish and protect our proprietary rights. We own numerous domain names, hold numerous patents, have registered numerous trademarks, and have filed applications for the registration of a number of our other trademarks and service marks in various jurisdictions. We hold assorted business licenses (such as pharmacy, occupational, liquor and cigarette) having various lives within multiple legal jurisdictions, which are necessary for the normal operation of our business.- 6 - Seasonal variations in business Our business is affected by a number of factors including, among others, our sales performance during holiday periods (including particularly the winter holiday season) and during the cough, cold and flu season (the timing and severity of which is difficult to predict), significant weather conditions, the timing of our own or competitor discount programs and pricing actions, and the timing of changes in levels of reimbursement from governmental agencies and other third party payers. See Summary of Quarterly Results (Unaudited) in the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 below.Sources and availability of raw materials Inventories are purchased from numerous domestic and foreign suppliers. We do not believe that the loss of any one supplier or group of suppliers under common control would have a material adverse effect on our business or that of any of our divisions.Working capital practices Effective inventory management is important to our operations. We use various inventory management techniques, including demand forecasting and planning and various forms of replenishment management. Our working capital needs typically are greater in the months leading up to the winter holiday season. We generally finance our inventory and expansion needs with internally generated funds and short-term borrowings. For additional information, see the Liquidity and Capital Resources section in Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in Part II, Item 7 below.Customers We sell to numerous retail and wholesale customers. No single customer accounted for more than 10% of the Companys consolidated sales for any of the periods presented. Two payers  accounted for approximately 22 % of the Retail Pharmacy USA divisions sales in fiscal 2016. One payer in the Retail Pharmacy International division accounted for approximately 18% of the divisions sales in fiscal 2016.Regulation In the countries in which we do business, we are subject to national, state and local laws, regulations, and administrative practices concerning retail and wholesale pharmacy operations, including regulations relating to our participation in Medicare, Medicaid and other publicly financed health benefit plans; regulations prohibiting kickbacks, beneficiary inducement and the submission of false claims; the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA); the ACA; licensure and registration requirements concerning the operation of pharmacies and the practice of pharmacy; and regulations of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, the U.S. Federal Trade Commission, the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration and the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission, as well as regulations promulgated by comparable foreign, state and local governmental authorities concerning the operation of our businesses. We are also subject to laws and regulations relating to licensing, tax, foreign trade, intellectual property, privacy and data protection, currency, political and other business restrictions.We are also governed by national, state and local laws of general applicability in the countries in which we do business, including laws regulating matters of working conditions, health and safety and equal employment opportunity. In connection with the operation of our businesses, we are subject to laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment and health and safety matters, including those governing exposure to, and the management and disposal of, hazardous substances. Environmental protection requirements did not have a material effect on our results of operations or capital expenditures in fiscal 2016.Competitive conditions The industries in which we operate are highly competitive. As a leader in the retail pharmacy industry and as a retailer of general merchandise, we compete with various local, regional, national and global retailers, including chain and independent pharmacies, mail order prescription providers, grocery stores, convenience stores, mass merchants, online and omni-channel pharmacies and retailers, warehouse clubs, dollar stores and other discount merchandisers. Our pharmaceutical wholesale businesses compete with other pharmaceutical wholesalers as well as alternative supply sources such as importers and manufacturers who supply directly to pharmacies. We compete primarily on the basis of service, convenience, variety and price. Our geographic dispersion helps mitigate the impact of temporary, localized economic and competitive conditions in individual markets. See Properties in Part I, Item 2 below for further information regarding our geographic dispersion.- 7 - Employees As of August 31, 2016, we employed approximately 360,000 persons, approximately 120,000 of whom were part-time employees working less than 30 hours per week. The foregoing does not include employees of unconsolidated partially-owned entities.Research and development While our global brands portfolio is enhanced by our in-house product research and development capabilities, the amount we spend on research and development activities is not material.Financial Information about Foreign and Domestic Operations and Export Sales Prior to completion of the Second Step Transaction, we accounted for our 45% investment in Alliance Boots using the equity method of accounting and as a result, no Alliance Boots sales were included in our sales prior to December 31, 2014. All our sales in fiscal year 2014 occurred within the United States, Puerto Rico, Guam and the U.S. Virgin Islands. Subsequent to the Second Step Transaction, Alliance Boots results have been fully consolidated. Certain financial information relating to foreign and domestic operations, including total revenues and long-lived assets aggregated by our U.S. and non-U.S. operations, is included in Note 18, Segment Reporting to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 below, which information is incorporated herein by reference. See Risk Factors in Part I, Item 1A below for information regarding risks attendant to our foreign operations.Available Information We file with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC) our Annual Report on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K and any amendments to those reports, as well as proxy statements and registration statements. You may read and copy any material we file with the SEC at the SECs Public Reference Room at 100 F Street, NE, Washington, D.C. 20549. You may also obtain information on the operation of the Public Reference Room by calling the SEC at 1-800-SEC-0330. In addition, the SEC maintains a website at http://www.sec.gov that contains reports, proxy and information statements, and other information regarding issuers, including us, that file electronically. We make available free of charge on or through our website at http://investor.walgreensbootsalliance.com our Annual Reports on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K and amendments to these reports filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Exchange Act as soon as reasonably practicable after we file or furnish them to the SEC. The contents of our website are not, however, a part of this Form 10-K or our other SEC filings.", "1A": " Item 1A. Risk Factors In addition to the other information in this report and our other filings with the SEC, you should carefully consider the risks described below, which could materially and adversely affect our business operations, financial condition and results of operations. These risks are not the only risks that we face. Our business operations could also be affected by additional factors that are not presently known to us or that we currently consider to be immaterial.Reductions in third party reimbursement levels, from private or governmental agency plans, and potential changes in industry pricing benchmarks for prescription drugs could materially and adversely affect our results of operations.The substantial majority of the prescriptions we fill are reimbursed by third party payers, including private and governmental agency payers. The continued efforts of health maintenance organizations, managed care organizations, pharmacy benefit management companies, governmental agencies, and other third party payers to reduce prescription drug costs and pharmacy reimbursement rates, as well as litigation and other legal proceedings relating to how drugs are priced, may adversely impact our results of operations. Changes in political, economic and regulatory influences also may significantly affect healthcare financing and prescription drug reimbursement practices. In the United States, plan changes with rate adjustments often occur in January and our reimbursement arrangements may provide for rate adjustments at prescribed intervals during their term. In addition, some of these entities may offer pricing terms that we may not be willing to accept or otherwise restrict our participation in their networks of pharmacy providers.- 8 - In the United States, for example, certain provisions of the ACA, which was signed into law on March 23, 2010, enacted, subject to rulemaking, a modified average manufacturer price (used in the Medicaid rebate and reimbursement formula for multi-source drugs) and in January 2016 the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services finalized a rule implementing the modified AMP as well as a requirement that Medicaid reimburse pharmacies at actual acquisition cost rather than estimated acquisition cost. These changes, which states had until May 2016 to implement, generally are expected to reduce Medicaid reimbursements and adversely affect our operating results. There have also been a number of other proposals and enactments by the federal government and various states to reduce Medicare Part D and Medicaid reimbursement levels in response to budget deficits, and we expect additional proposals in the future. In addition, many payers in the United States are increasingly considering new metrics as the basis for reimbursement rates, such as average sales price, average manufacturer price, and actual acquisition cost. It is possible that the pharmaceutical industry or regulators may evaluate and/or develop an alternative pricing reference to replace average wholesale price, which is the pricing reference used for many of our contracts. Future changes to the pricing benchmarks used to establish pharmaceutical pricing, including changes in the basis for calculating reimbursement by third party payers, could adversely affect us. There can be no assurance that recent or future changes in prescription drug reimbursement policies and practices will not materially and adversely affect our results of operations.In many countries in Europe and elsewhere, the government provides or subsidizes healthcare to consumers and regulates pharmaceutical prices, patient eligibility and reimbursement levels to control costs for the government-sponsored healthcare system. Efforts to control healthcare costs, including prescription drug costs, are continuous. A shift in pharmacy mix toward lower margin plans and programs could adversely affect our results of operations.A shift in the mix of pharmacy prescription volume towards programs offering lower reimbursement rates could adversely affect our results of operations. Our Retail Pharmacy USA division continued to experience a shift in pharmacy mix towards 90-day at retail in fiscal 2016 and that trend may continue in fiscal 2017. Our 90-day at retail offering for patients with chronic prescription needs typically is at a lower margin than comparable 30-day prescriptions. Our Retail Pharmacy USA division also experienced a shift in pharmacy mix towards Medicare Part D prescriptions in fiscal 2016, and we expect that trend to continue in fiscal 2017. Preferred Medicare Part D networks have increased in number in recent years ; however, we do not participate in all such networks. We have accepted lower reimbursement rates in order to secure preferred relationships with Medicare Part D plans serving senior patients with significant pharmacy needs. We also have worked to develop and expand our relationships with commercial third party payers to enable new and/or improved market access via participation in the pharmacy provider networks they offer. If we are not able to generate additional prescription volume and other business from patients participating in these programs that is sufficient to offset the impact of lower reimbursement, or if the degree or terms of our participation in such preferred networks declines from current levels in future years, our results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.We could be adversely affected by a decrease in the introduction of new brand name and generic prescription drugs as well as increases in the cost to procure prescription drugs.New brand name drugs can result in increased drug utilization and associated sales, while the introduction of lower priced generic alternatives typically results in relatively lower sales, but relatively higher gross profit margins. Accordingly, a decrease in the number or magnitude of significant new brand name drugs or generics successfully introduced, or delays in their introduction, could materially and adversely affect our results of operations.In addition, if we experience an increase in the amounts we pay to procure pharmaceutical drugs, including generic drugs, it could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. Our gross profit margins would be adversely affected to the extent we are not able to offset such cost increases. Any failure to fully offset any such increased prices and costs or to modify our activities to mitigate the impact could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. Additionally, any future changes in drug prices could be significantly different than our projections.- 9 - We derive a significant portion of our sales in the United States from prescription drug sales reimbursed by pharmacy benefit management companies.We derive a significant portion of our sales in the United States from prescription drug sales reimbursed through prescription drug plans administered by PBM companies. PBM companies typically administer multiple prescription drug plans that expire at various times and provide for varying reimbursement rates, and often limit coverage to specific drug products on an approved list, known as a formulary, which might not include all of the approved drugs for a particular indication. There can be no assurance that we will continue to participate in any particular PBM companys pharmacy provider network in any particular future time period. If our participation in the pharmacy provider network for a prescription drug plan administered by one or more of the large PBM companies is restricted or terminated, we expect that our sales would be adversely affected, at least in the short-term. If we are unable to replace any such lost sales, either through an increase in other sales or through a resumption of participation in those plans, our operating results could be materially and adversely affected. If we exit a pharmacy provider network and later resume participation, there can be no assurance that we will achieve any particular level of business on any particular pace, or that all clients of the PBM company will choose to include us again in the pharmacy network for their plans, initially or at all. In addition, in such circumstances we may incur increased marketing and other costs in connection with initiatives to regain former patients and attract new patients covered by such plans.Consolidation and strategic alliances in the healthcare industry could adversely affect our business operations, competitive positioning, financial condition and results of operations.Many organizations in the healthcare industry, including PBM companies and health insurance companies, have consolidated in recent years to create larger healthcare enterprises with greater bargaining power, which has resulted in greater pricing pressures. For example, in July 2015, OptumRx, UnitedHealth Groups pharmacy care services business, completed its combination with Catamaran Corporation, with the combined businesses becoming the third largest PBM company in the United States. In addition, significant business combinations within the health insurance industry are currently pending, including the transactions contemplated by Anthem, Inc.s agreement to acquire Cigna Corporation, and Aetna, Inc.s agreement to acquire Humana Inc. If these pending transactions are completed, the resulting enterprises are expected to be two of the three largest health insurers in the United States. If this consolidation trend continues, it could give the resulting enterprises even greater bargaining power, which may lead to further pressure on the prices for our products and services. If these pressures result in reductions in our prices, our businesses would become less profitable unless we are able to achieve corresponding reductions in costs.New partnerships and strategic alliances in the healthcare industry also can alter market dynamics and impact our businesses and competitive positioning. For example, following the announcement of our agreement with AmerisourceBergen providing for, among other things, generic drug purchasing through WBAD, our global sourcing enterprise, some of our retail pharmacy competitors subsequently established relationships with other pharmaceutical drug wholesalers relating to generic drug procurement. In addition, further consolidation among generic drug manufacturers could lead to generic drug inflation in the future. We expect that market demand, government regulation, third-party reimbursement policies, government contracting requirements, and other pressures will continue to cause the healthcare industry to evolve, potentially resulting in further business consolidations and alliances and increased vertical integration among the industry participants we engage with, and which could, if we are not able to successfully anticipate and respond to evolving industry conditions in a timely and effective manner, materially and adversely impact our business operations, financial condition and results of operations.Our growth strategy is partially dependent upon our ability to identify and successfully complete acquisitions, joint ventures and other strategic alliances.A significant element of our growth strategy is to identify, pursue and successfully complete acquisitions, joint ventures and other strategic alliances that either expand or complement our existing operations. We have grown significantly through acquisitions in recent years and expect to continue to acquire, partner with or invest in businesses that build on or are deemed complementary to our existing businesses or further our strategic objectives. Due in part to consolidation in the industries in which we compete, there is significant competition for attractive targets and opportunities when available. There can be no assurance that attractive acquisition or other strategic relationship opportunities will be available, that we will be successful in identifying, negotiating and consummating favorable transaction opportunities, or that any such transactions we complete will be successful and justify our investment of financial and other resources therein.Acquisitions and other strategic transactions involve numerous risks, including difficulties in successfully integrating the operations and personnel, distraction of management from overseeing, and disruption of, our existing operations, difficulties in entering markets or lines of business in which we have no or limited direct prior experience, the possible loss of key employees and customers, and difficulties in achieving the synergies we anticipated. Any failure to select suitable opportunities at fair prices, conduct appropriate due diligence and successfully integrate the acquired company, including particularly when acquired businesses operate in new geographic markets or areas of business, could materially and adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations. These transactions may also cause us to significantly increase our interest expense, leverage and debt service requirements if we incur additional debt to pay for an acquisition or investment, issue common stock that would dilute our current stockholders percentage ownership, or incur asset write-offs and restructuring costs and other related expenses that could have a material adverse impact on our operating results. Acquisitions, joint ventures and strategic investments also involve numerous other risks, including potential exposure to assumed litigation and unknown environmental and other liabilities, as well as undetected internal control, regulatory or other issues, or additional costs not anticipated at the time the transaction was completed. No assurance can be given that our acquisitions, joint ventures and other strategic alliances will be successful and will not materially adversely affect our business operations, financial condition or results of operations. If we are unable to successfully identify, complete and integrate acquisitions, joint ventures and strategic investments in a timely and effective manner, our business operations and growth strategies could be negatively affected.- 10 - We may not be able to successfully or timely complete the pending acquisition of Rite Aid.Risks and uncertainties related to our pending acquisition of Rite Aid include, among others: the occurrence of any event, change or other circumstance that could give rise to the termination of the Merger Agreement including that regulatory or other approvals required for the transaction are not obtained; that litigation may be filed which could prevent or delay the transaction; and that uncertainty regarding the transaction may adversely affect our and Rite Aids relationships with suppliers, payers, customers and other third parties with which we or Rite Aid do business.Completion of the transaction is subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement, including the expiration or termination of applicable waiting periods (and any extensions thereof) under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended, no material adverse effect having occurred with respect to Rite Aid prior to the closing of the transaction, and other customary conditions. We will be unable to complete the pending acquisition of Rite Aid until each of the conditions to closing is either satisfied or waived. In deciding whether or not to object to the transaction, regulatory agencies have broad discretion in administering the applicable governing regulations. As a condition to their approval of the transaction, these agencies may impose requirements, limitations or costs or require divestitures or place restrictions on the conduct of our business after consummation of the transaction. These requirements, limitations, costs, divestitures or restrictions may be burdensome to complete, increase our costs, reduce the anticipated benefits of the transaction and materially and adversely affect our results of operations after the closing of the transaction. We can provide no assurance that we will obtain the necessary approvals on any particular timetable or at all, or that any such conditions that are imposed would not diminish the anticipated benefits of the transaction or result in the termination of the transaction. In the event that the transaction is not completed due to the failure to obtain antitrust clearance, we could be required to pay Rite Aid a termination fee of $325 million or $650 million in certain circumstances.While our acquisition of Rite Aid is pending, it creates uncertainty that may adversely affect our and Rite Aids respective businesses and results of operations, including with respect to relationships with suppliers, payers, customers and other third parties. We have incurred and will continue to incur significant costs, expenses and fees for professional services and other transaction costs in connection with the pending transaction, as well as the diversion of management resources, for which we will receive little or no benefit if the closing of the transaction does not occur. Further, in the event that such merger is not consummated on or prior to June 1, 2017 or if the Merger Agreement is terminated at any time on or prior to June 1, 2017, then we would be required to redeem $3.5 billion aggregate principal amount of notes of various interest rates and maturities on the date described in the applicable note at a redemption price equal to 101% of the aggregate principal amount of the notes to be redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the date of redemption. See Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  Liquidity and Capital Resources for additional information If we complete our pending acquisition of Rite Aid, we may not realize the anticipated benefits of the transaction, which could adversely impact our results of operations.We entered into the Merger Agreement to acquire Rite Aid with the expectation that the transaction will result in various benefits, including, among other things, cost savings and operating efficiencies. The achievement of the anticipated benefits of the transaction is subject to a number of uncertainties, including whether Rite Aids business can be integrated into ours in an efficient and effective manner, the possibility of faulty assumptions underlying expectations regarding potential synergies and the integration process, unforeseen expenses or delays, and competitive factors in the marketplace. If the Rite Aid transaction is completed, we can provide no assurance that the anticipated benefits of the transaction, including cost savings and synergies, will be fully realized in the time frame anticipated or at all; the costs or difficulties related to the integration of Rite Aids business and operations into ours will not be greater than expected; unanticipated costs, charges and expenses will not result from the transaction; litigation relating to the transaction will not be filed; we will be able to retain key personnel; and the transaction will not cause disruption to the parties business and operations and relationships with employees and suppliers, payers, customers and other third parties. If one or more of these risks are realized, it could have a material adverse impact on our operating results.- 11 - We could also encounter unforeseen transaction and integration-related costs or other circumstances, such as unforeseen liabilities or other issues existing or arising with respect to the business of Rite Aid or otherwise resulting from the transaction. Many of these potential circumstances are outside of our control and any of them could result in increased costs, decreased revenue, decreased synergies and the diversion of management time and attention, which could adversely impact our agility to respond to market opportunities and our ability to timely identify and implement other strategic actions. If we are unable to achieve our objectives within the anticipated time frame, or at all, the expected benefits may not be realized fully or at all, or may take longer to realize than expected, which could have a material adverse impact on our business operations, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, we have incurred significant transaction costs related to the acquisition and, if the pending transaction is consummated, we will continue to incur significant integration and related costs as we integrate the Rite Aid businesses. These integration and acquisition-related costs, including legal, accounting, financial and tax advisory and other fees and costs, may be higher than expected and some of these costs may be material.Our substantial operations outside of the United States subject us to a number of operating, economic, political, regulatory and other international business risks.Our substantial international business operations are important to our growth and prospects, including particularly those of our Retail Pharmacy International and Pharmaceutical Wholesale divisions, and are subject to a number of risks, including:##TABLE_START  compliance with a wide variety of foreign laws and regulations, including retail and wholesale pharmacy, licensing, tax, foreign trade, intellectual property, privacy and data protection, currency, political and other business restrictions and requirements and local laws and regulations, whose interpretation and enforcement vary significantly among jurisdictions and can change significantly over time;##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START additional U.S. and other regulation of non-domestic operations, including regulation under the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the U.K. Bribery Act and other anti-corruption laws;##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START potential difficulties in managing foreign operations, mitigating credit risks in foreign markets, enforcing agreements and collecting receivables through foreign legal systems;##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START price controls imposed by foreign countries;##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START tariffs, duties or other restrictions on foreign currencies or trade sanctions and other trade barriers imposed by foreign countries that restrict or prohibit business transactions in certain markets;##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START potential adverse tax consequences, including tax withholding laws and policies and restrictions on repatriation of funds to the United States;##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START fluctuations in currency exchange rates, including uncertainty regarding the Euro;##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START impact of recessions and economic slowdowns in economies outside the United States, including foreign currency devaluation, higher interest rates, inflation, and increased government regulation or ownership of traditional private businesses;##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START the instability of foreign economies, governments and currencies and unexpected regulatory, economic or political changes in foreign markets; and##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START developing and emerging markets may be especially vulnerable to periods of instability and unexpected changes, and consumers in those markets may have relatively limited resources to spend on products and services.##TABLE_END These factors can also adversely affect our payers, vendors and customers in international markets, which in turn can negatively impact our businesses. We cannot assure you that one or more of these factors will not have a material adverse effect on our business operations, results of operation and financial condition.- 12 - Our Retail Pharmacy International and Pharmaceutical Wholesale divisions have substantial operations in the United Kingdom and other member countries of the European Union. On June 23, 2016, voters in the United Kingdom approved an advisory referendum to withdraw from the European Union, which proposed exit (and the political, economic and other uncertainties it has raised) has exacerbated and may further exacerbate many of the risks and uncertainties described above. Negotiations on withdrawal and post-exit arrangements likely will be complex and protracted, and there can be no assurance regarding the terms, timing or consummation of any such arrangements. The proposed withdrawal could, among other potential outcomes, adversely affect the tax, tax treaty, currency, operational, legal and regulatory regimes to which our businesses in the region are subject. The withdrawal could also, among other potential outcomes, disrupt the free movement of goods, services and people between the United Kingdom and the European Union and significantly disrupt trade between the United Kingdom and the European Union and other parties. Further, uncertainty around these and related issues could lead to adverse effects on the economy of the United Kingdom and the other economies in which we operate. There can be no assurance that any or all of these events will not have a material adverse effect on our business operations, results of operations and financial condition.We are exposed to risks associated with foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations.Our significant operations outside of the United States expose us to currency exchange rate fluctuations and related risks, including transaction currency exposures relating to the import and export of goods in currencies other than businesses functional currencies as well as currency translation exposures relating to profits and net assets denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. We present our financial statements in U.S. dollars and have a significant proportion of net assets and income in non-U.S. dollar currencies, primarily British Pounds Sterling and the Euro, as well as a range of other foreign currencies. Our results of operations and capital ratios can therefore be sensitive to movements in foreign exchange rates. Due to the constantly changing currency exposures to which we are subject and the volatility of currency exchange rates, we cannot predict the effect of exchange rate fluctuations upon our future results of operations. In addition, fluctuations in currencies relative to the U.S. dollar may make it more difficult to perform period-to-period comparisons of our reported results of operations. A depreciation of non-U.S. dollar currencies relative to the U.S. dollar could have a significant adverse impact on our results of operations.We may from time to time, in some instances, enter into foreign currency contracts or other derivative instruments intended to hedge a portion of our foreign currency fluctuation risks, which subjects us to additional risks , such as the risk that counterparties may fail to honor their obligations to us , that could materially and adversely affect us. Additionally, we may (and currently do) use foreign currency borrowings to hedge some of our foreign currency fluctuation risks. The periodic use of such hedging activities may not offset any or more than a portion of the adverse financial effects of unfavorable movements in foreign exchange rates over the limited time the hedges are in place. We cannot assure you that fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, including particularly the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against major currencies or the currencies of large developing countries, will not materially affect our consolidated financial results.Our business results depend on our ability to successfully manage ongoing organizational change and achieve cost savings and operating efficiency initiatives.Our Board of Directors approved the plan to implement the Cost Transformation Program described in MDA in Part II, Item 7 below as part of an initiative to reduce costs and increase operating efficiencies. There can be no assurance that we will realize, in full or in part, the anticipated benefits of this program. Our financial goals assume a level of productivity improvement, including those reflected in our Cost Transformation Program and other business optimization initiatives. If we are unable to deliver these expected productivity improvements, while continuing to invest in business growth, or if the volume and nature of change overwhelms available resources, our business operations and financial results could be materially and adversely impacted. Our ability to successfully manage and execute these initiatives and realize expected savings and benefits in the amounts and at the times anticipated is important to our business success. Any failure to do so, which could result from our inability to successfully execute plans, changes in global or regional economic conditions, competition, changes in the industries in which we compete, unanticipated costs or charges, loss of key personnel and other factors described herein, could have a material adverse effect on our businesses, financial condition and results of operations.Disruption in our global supply chain could negatively impact our businesses.The products we sell are sourced from a wide variety of domestic and international vendors, and any future disruption in our supply chain or inability to find qualified vendors and access products that meet requisite quality and safety standards in a timely and efficient manner could adversely impact our businesses. The loss or disruption of such supply arrangements for any reason, including for issues such as labor disputes, loss or impairment of key manufacturing sites, inability to procure sufficient raw materials, quality control issues, ethical sourcing issues, the suppliers financial distress, natural disasters, civil unrest or acts of war or terrorism or other external factors over which we have no control, could interrupt product supply and, if not effectively managed and remedied, have a material adverse impact on our business operations, financial condition and results of operations.- 13 - We use a single wholesaler of branded and generic pharmaceutical drugs as our primary source of such products for our Retail Pharmacy USA division.In March 2013, Walgreens, Alliance Boots and AmerisourceBergen announced various agreements and arrangements, including a ten-year pharmaceutical distribution agreement between Walgreens and AmerisourceBergen pursuant to which Walgreens sources branded and generic pharmaceutical products from AmerisourceBergen in the U.S. and an agreement which provides AmerisourceBergen the ability to access generics pharmaceutical products through WBAD, our global sourcing enterprise. In May 2016, certain of these agreements were extended for three years to now expire in 2026. In addition, in March 2013, Walgreens, Alliance Boots and AmerisourceBergen entered into agreements and arrangements pursuant to which we have the right, but not the obligation, to purchase a minority equity position in AmerisourceBergen and gain associated representation on AmerisourceBergens board of directors in certain circumstances. As of the date of this report, AmerisourceBergen distributes for our Retail Pharmacy USA division all branded pharmaceutical products that Walgreens historically sourced from suppliers and distributors as well as substantially all generic pharmaceutical products that previously were self-distributed. Consequently, our business in the United States may be adversely affected by any operational, financial or regulatory difficulties that AmerisourceBergen experiences. For example, if AmerisourceBergens operations are seriously disrupted for any reason, whether due to a natural disaster, labor disruption, regulatory action, computer or operational systems or otherwise, it could adversely affect our business in the United States and our results of operations.Our distribution agreement with AmerisourceBergen is subject to early termination in certain circumstances and, upon the expiration or termination of the agreement, there can be no assurance that we or AmerisourceBergen will be willing to renew the agreement or enter into a new agreement, on terms favorable to us or at all. If such expiration or termination occurred, we believe that alternative sources of supply for most generic and brand-name pharmaceuticals are readily available and that we could obtain and qualify alternative sources, which may include resuming self-distribution in some cases, for substantially all of the prescription drugs we sell on an acceptable basis, such that the impact of any expiration or termination would be temporary. However, there can be no assurance we would be able to engage alternative supply sources or implement self-distribution processes on a timely basis or on terms favorable to us, or effectively manage these transitions, any of which could adversely affect our business operations, financial condition and results of operations.The anticipated strategic and financial benefits of our relationship with AmerisourceBergen may not be realized.We entered into the arrangement with AmerisourceBergen with the expectation that the transactions contemplated thereby would result in various benefits including, among other things, procurement cost savings and operating efficiencies, innovation and sharing of best practices. The processes and initiatives needed to achieve these potential benefits are complex, costly and time-consuming. Many of the anticipated synergies and expenses that will be incurred, by their nature, are difficult to estimate accurately at the present time. Achieving the anticipated benefits from the arrangement is subject to a number of significant challenges and uncertainties, including the possibility of faulty assumptions underlying expectations, processes or initiatives, or the inability to realize and/or delays in realizing potential benefits and synergies, whether unique corporate cultures of separate organizations will work collaboratively in an efficient and effective manner, unforeseen expenses or delays, and competitive factors in the marketplace.As of August 31, 2016, we beneficially owned approximately 24% of the outstanding AmerisourceBergen common stock and had designated one member of AmerisourceBergens board of directors. In addition, we have the right, but not the obligation, under the transactions contemplated by the Framework Agreement dated as of March 18, 2013 by and among the Company, Alliance Boots and AmerisourceBergen (the Framework Agreement) to acquire up to an additional 8,398,752 AmerisourceBergen shares in the open market and thereafter designate another member of AmerisourceBergens board of directors, subject in each case to applicable legal and contractual requirements. There can be no assurance that we will complete any specific level of such potential equity investments in AmerisourceBergen, or that our existing investment, or any future investment if completed, will ultimately be profitable. If the price of AmerisourceBergen common stock subsequently declines substantially, we could experience a loss on or impairment of such investment, which could materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. Further, our ability to transact in AmerisourceBergen securities is subject to certain restrictions set forth in our agreements with AmerisourceBergen and arising under applicable laws and regulations, which in some circumstances could adversely our ability to transact in AmerisourceBergen securities in amounts and at the times desired. We could also encounter unforeseen costs, circumstances or issues existing or arising with respect to the transactions and collaboration we anticipate resulting from the Framework Agreement. Many of these potential circumstances are outside of our control and any of them could result in increased costs, decreased revenue, decreased synergies and the diversion of management time and attention. If we are unable to achieve our objectives within the anticipated time frame, or at all, the expected benefits may not be realized fully or at all, or may take longer to realize than expected, which could have a material adverse impact on our business operations, financial condition and results of operations.- 14 - From time to time, we make investments in companies over which we do not have sole control, including our investment in AmerisourceBergen. Some of these companies may operate in sectors that differ from our current operations and have different risks.From time to time, we make debt or equity investments in other companies that we may not control or over which we may not have sole control. For example, while we have a significant equity investment in AmerisourceBergen and have a designee serving on the board of directors of AmerisourceBergen as of the date of this report, we do not and will not have the ability to control day-to-day operations of that company. Although the businesses in which we have made non-controlling investments often have a significant health and daily living or prescription drug component, some of them operate in businesses that are different from our primary lines of business and/or operate in different geographic markets than we do. Investments in these businesses, among other risks, subject us to the operating and financial risks of the businesses we invest in and to the risk that we do not have sole control over the operations of these businesses. We rely on the internal controls and financial reporting controls of these entities and their failure to maintain effectiveness or comply with applicable standards may materially and adversely affect us. Investments in entities over which we do not have sole control, including joint ventures and strategic alliances, present additional risks such as having differing objectives from our partners or the entities in which we are invested, becoming involved in disputes, or competing with those persons. From time to time, we may make additional investments in or acquire other entities that may subject us to similar risks.Changes in economic conditions could adversely affect consumer buying practices.Our performance has been, and may continue to be, adversely impacted by changes in global, national, regional or local economic conditions and consumer confidence. These conditions can also adversely affect our key vendors and customers. External factors that affect consumer confidence and over which we exercise no influence include unemployment rates, levels of personal disposable income, levels of taxes and interest and global, national, regional or local economic conditions, as well as acts of war or terrorism. Changes in economic conditions and consumer confidence could adversely affect consumer preferences, purchasing power and spending patterns, which could lead to a decrease in overall consumer spending. In addition, reduced or flat consumer spending may drive us and our competitors to offer additional products at promotional prices. All of these factors could materially and adversely impact our business operations, financial condition and results of operations.Economic conditions in Europe and certain emerging market countries, together with austerity measures being taken by certain governments, could adversely affect us.We have significant assets and operations within Europe and certain emerging market countries in our Retail Pharmacy International and Pharmaceutical Wholesale divisions. An economic slowdown within any such markets could adversely affect our businesses in affected regions by reducing the prices our customers may be able or willing to pay for our products and services or by reducing the demand for our products and services, either of which could result in a material adverse impact on our results of operations. In recent years, in response to the economic environment, a number of governments have announced or implemented austerity measures to reduce healthcare spending for the government-sponsored healthcare system and constrain overall government expenditures. These measures, which include efforts aimed at reforming healthcare coverage and reducing healthcare costs, continue to exert pressure on the pricing of and reimbursement timelines for pharmaceutical drugs. Countries with existing austerity measures may impose additional laws, regulations, or requirements on the healthcare industry. In addition, governments that have not yet imposed austerity measures may impose them in the future. Any new austerity measures may be similar to or vary in scope and nature from existing austerity measures and could have a material adverse effect on our international business operations and results of operations.- 15 - The industries in which we operate are highly competitive and constantly evolving. New entrants to the market, existing competitor actions, or other changes in market dynamics could adversely impact us.The level of competition among retail pharmacies and pharmaceutical wholesalers is high. Changes in market dynamics or actions of competitors or manufacturers, including industry consolidation and the emergence of new competitors and strategic alliances, could materially and adversely impact us. Disruptive innovation by existing or new competitors could alter the competitive landscape in the future and require us to accurately identify and assess such changes and make timely and effective changes to our strategies and business model to compete effectively. Our retail pharmacy businesses face intense competition from local, regional, national and global companies, including other drugstore and pharmacy chains, independent drugstores and pharmacies, mail-order prescription providers and various other retailers such as grocery stores, convenience stores, mass merchants, online and omni-channel pharmacies and retailers, warehouse clubs, dollar stores and other discount merchandisers, some of which are aggressively expanding in markets we serve. Businesses in our Pharmaceutical Wholesale division face intense competition from direct competitors, including national and regional cooperative wholesalers, and alternative supply sources such as importers and manufacturers who supply directly to pharmacies. Competition may also come from other sources in the future. As competition increases in the markets in which we operate, a significant increase in general pricing pressures could occur, which could require us to reevaluate our pricing structures to remain competitive. For example, if we are not able to anticipate and successfully respond to changes in market conditions in our Pharmaceutical Wholesale division, including changes driven by competitors, suppliers or manufacturers and increased competition from national and regional cooperative wholesalers, it could result in a loss of customers or renewal of contracts or arrangements on less favorable terms.We also could be adversely affected if we fail to identify or effectively respond to changes in market dynamics. For example, specialty pharmacy represents a significant and growing proportion of prescription drug spending in the United States, a significant portion of which is dispensed outside of traditional retail pharmacies. Because our specialty pharmacy business focuses on complex and high-cost medications that serve a relatively limited universe of patients, the future growth of this business depends to a significant extent upon expanding our ability to access key drugs and successfully penetrate key treatment categories. If we are not able to compete effectively in this evolving market, it could have an adverse effect on our business operations, financial condition and results of operations.If the merchandise and services that we offer fail to meet customer needs, our sales may be adversely affected.We could be adversely affected by changes in consumer spending levels and shopping habits and preferences, including attitudes towards our retail and product brands. The success of our retail pharmacy businesses depends on our ability to offer a superior shopping experience, engaging customer service and a quality assortment of available merchandise that differentiates us from other retailers, including enhanced health and beauty product offerings. We must identify, obtain supplies of, and offer to our customers attractive, innovative and high-quality merchandise on a continuous basis. Our products and services must satisfy the needs and desires of our customers, whose preferences may change in the future. It is difficult to predict consistently and successfully the products and services our customers will demand. If we misjudge either the demand for products and services we sell or our customers purchasing habits and tastes, we may be faced with excess inventories of some products and missed opportunities for products and services we chose not to offer. In addition, our sales may decline or we may be required to sell the merchandise we have obtained at lower prices. Failure to timely identify or effectively respond to changing consumer tastes, preferences and spending patterns and evolving demographic mixes in the markets we serve could negatively affect our relationship with our customers and the demand for our products and services, which could materially and adversely impact our results of operations.Our private brand offerings expose us to various additional risks.In addition to brand name products, we offer our customers private brand products that are not available from other retailers. We seek to continue to grow our exclusive private brand offerings as part of our growth strategy, including through the expanded offering of No7 and other brands owned or licensed on an exclusive basis, as well as through selective acquisitions. Maintaining consistent product quality, competitive pricing, and availability of our private brand offerings for our customers, as well as the timely development and introduction of new products, is important in differentiating us from other retailers and developing and maintaining customer loyalty. Although we believe that our private brand products offer value to our customers and typically provide us with higher gross margins than comparable national brand products we sell, the expansion of our private brand offerings also subjects us to additional risks, such as potential product liability risks and mandatory or voluntary product recalls; our ability to successfully protect our proprietary rights and successfully navigate and avoid claims related to the proprietary rights of third parties; our ability to successfully administer and comply with applicable contractual obligations and regulatory requirements; and other risks generally encountered by entities that source, sell and market exclusive branded offerings for retail. An increase in sales of our private brands may also adversely affect sales of our vendors products, which, in turn, could adversely affect our relationship with certain of our vendors. Any failure to adequately address some or all of these risks could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, business operations, results of operations and financial condition.- 16 - If we do not successfully develop and maintain a relevant omni-channel experience for our customers, our businesses and results of operations could be adversely impacted.Our business has evolved from an in-store experience to interaction with customers across numerous channels, including in-store, online, mobile and social media, among others. Omni-channel retailing is rapidly evolving and we must keep pace with changing customer expectations and new developments by our competitors. For example, in July 2016, we announced that we would cease operations at our drugstore.com and beauty .com properties in furtherance of our omni-channel strategy and initiatives to greater focus on the development of walgreens .com in the United States . Our customers are increasingly using computers, tablets, mobile phones, and other devices to comparison shop, determine product availability and complete purchases online. We must compete by offering a consistent and convenient shopping experience for our customers regardless of the ultimate sales channel and by investing in, providing and maintaining digital tools for our customers that have the right features and are reliable and easy to use. If we are unable to make, improve, or develop relevant customer-facing technology in a timely manner, our ability to compete and our results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. In addition, if our online activities or our other customer-facing technology systems do not function as designed, we may experience a loss of customer confidence, data security breaches, lost sales, or be exposed to fraudulent purchases, any of which could materially and adversely affect our business operations, reputation and results of operations.We may be constrained if we are unable to find suitable new store locations at acceptable prices or by the terms of our current leases.Our ability to grow our retail pharmacy businesses may be constrained if suitable new store locations cannot be identified with lease terms or purchase prices that are acceptable to us. We compete with other retailers and businesses for suitable locations for our stores. Local land use and other regulations applicable to the types of stores we desire to construct may impact our ability to find suitable locations and influence the cost of constructing our stores. The termination or expiration of leases at existing store locations may adversely affect us if the renewal terms of those leases are unacceptable to us and we are forced to close or relocate stores. Further, changing local demographics at existing store locations may adversely affect revenue and profitability levels at those stores.We may experience a significant disruption in our computer systems.We rely extensively on our computer systems to manage our ordering, pricing, point-of-sale, pharmacy fulfillment, inventory replenishment, customer loyalty programs, finance and other processes. Our systems are subject to damage or interruption from power outages, computer and telecommunications failures, computer viruses, security breaches, vandalism, natural disasters, catastrophic events and human error, and our disaster recovery planning cannot account for all eventualities. If any of our systems are damaged, fail to function properly or otherwise become unavailable, we may incur substantial costs to repair or replace them, and may experience loss or corruption of critical data and interruptions or disruptions and delays in our ability to perform critical functions, which could materially and adversely affect our businesses and results of operations. In addition, we are currently making, and expect to continue to make, substantial investments in our information technology systems and infrastructure, some of which are significant. Upgrades involve replacing existing systems with successor systems, making changes to existing systems, or cost-effectively acquiring new systems with new functionality. Implementing new systems carries significant potential risks, including failure to operate as designed, potential loss or corruption of data or information, cost overruns, implementation delays, disruption of operations, and the potential inability to meet business and reporting requirements. While we are aware of inherent risks associated with replacing these systems and believe we are taking reasonable action to mitigate known risks, there can be no assurance that we will not experience significant issues with our existing systems prior to implementation, that our technology initiatives will be successfully deployed as planned or that they will be timely implemented without significant disruption to our operations. We also could be adversely affected by any significant disruption in the systems of third parties we interact with, including key payers and vendors.If we or the businesses we interact with do not maintain the privacy and security of sensitive customer and business information, it could damage our reputation and we could suffer a loss of revenue, incur substantial additional costs and become subject to litigation and regulatory scrutiny.The protection of customer, employee, and company data is critical to our businesses. Cybersecurity and other information technology security risks, such as a significant breach of customer, employee, or company data, could attract a substantial amount of media attention, damage our customer relationships and reputation, and result in lost sales, fines or lawsuits. Throughout our operations, we receive, retain and transmit certain personal information that our customers and others provide to purchase products or services, fill prescriptions, enroll in promotional programs, participate in our customer loyalty programs, register on our websites, or otherwise communicate and interact with us. In addition, aspects of our operations depend upon the secure transmission of confidential information over public networks. Although we deploy a layered approach to address information security threats and vulnerabilities designed to protect confidential information against data security breaches, a compromise of our data security systems or of those of businesses with whom we interact, which results in confidential information being accessed, obtained, damaged or used by unauthorized or improper persons, could harm our reputation and expose us to regulatory actions and claims from customers, financial institutions, payment card associations and other persons, any of which could materially and adversely affect our business operations, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, a security breach could require that we expend substantial additional resources related to the security of information systems and disrupt our businesses.- 17 - The regulatory environment surrounding information security and privacy is increasingly demanding, with the frequent imposition of new and changing requirements across businesses. We are required to comply with increasingly complex and changing data privacy regulations in the United States and in other countries in which we operate that regulate the collection, use and transfer of personal data, including the transfer of personal data between or among countries. Some foreign data privacy regulations are more stringent than those in the United States and continue to change. For example, in May 2016 the General Data Protection Regulation was formally published in the Journal of the European Union and comes into effect in May 2018. Complying with these and other changing requirements could cause us to incur substantial costs and require us to change our business practices in certain jurisdictions, any of which could materially adversely affect our business operations and operating results. We may also face audits or investigations by one or more domestic or foreign government agencies relating to our compliance with these regulations. Compliance with changes in privacy and information security laws and standards may result in significant expense due to increased investment in technology and the development of new operational processes. If we or those with whom we share information fail to comply with these laws and regulations or experience a data security breach, our reputation could be damaged and we could be subject to additional litigation and regulatory risks. Our security measures may be undermined due to the actions of outside parties, employee error, malfeasance, or otherwise, and, as a result, an unauthorized party may obtain access to our data systems and misappropriate business and personal information. Because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access, disable or degrade service, or sabotage systems change frequently and may not immediately produce signs of intrusion, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures. Any such breach or unauthorized access could result in significant legal and financial exposure, damage to our reputation, and potentially have a material adverse effect on our business operations, financial condition and results of operations.We are subject to payment-related risks that could increase our operating costs, expose us to fraud or theft, subject us to potential liability and potentially disrupt our business operations.We accept payments using a variety of methods, including cash, checks, credit and debit cards, gift cards and mobile payment technologies such as Apple Pay, and we may offer new payment options over time. Acceptance of these payment options subjects us to rules, regulations, contractual obligations and compliance requirements, including payment network rules and operating guidelines, data security standards and certification requirements, and rules governing electronic funds transfers. These requirements and related interpretations may change over time, which could make compliance more difficult or costly. For certain payment methods, including credit and debit cards, we pay interchange and other fees, which could increase over time and raise our operating costs. We rely on third parties to provide payment processing services, including the processing of credit cards, debit cards, and other forms of electronic payment. If these companies become unable to provide these services to us, or if their systems are compromised, it could disrupt our business. The payment methods that we offer also subject us to potential fraud and theft by persons who seek to obtain unauthorized access to or exploit any weaknesses that may exist in the payment systems. If we fail to comply with applicable rules or requirements, or if data is compromised due to a breach or misuse of data relating to our payment systems, we may be liable for costs incurred by payment card issuing banks and other third parties or subject to fines and higher transaction fees, or our ability to accept or facilitate certain types of payments could be impaired. In addition, our reputation could suffer and our customers could lose confidence in certain payment types, which could result in higher costs and/or reduced sales and materially and adversely affect our results of operations.Changes in healthcare regulatory environments may adversely affect our businesses.Political, economic and regulatory influences are subjecting the healthcare industry to significant changes that could adversely affect our results of operations. In recent years, the healthcare industry has undergone significant changes in an effort to reduce costs and government spending. These changes include an increased reliance on managed care; cuts in certain Medicare and Medicaid funding in the United States and the funding of governmental payers in foreign jurisdictions; consolidation of competitors, suppliers and other market participants; and the development of large, sophisticated purchasing groups. We expect the healthcare industry to continue to change significantly in the future. Some of these potential changes, such as a reduction in governmental funding for certain healthcare services or adverse changes in legislation or regulations governing prescription drug pricing, healthcare services or mandated benefits, may cause customers to reduce the amount of our products and services they purchase or the price they are willing to pay for our products and services. We expect continued governmental and private payer pressure to reduce pharmaceutical pricing. Changes in pharmaceutical manufacturers pricing or distribution policies could also significantly reduce our profitability.- 18 - The ACA was enacted in 2010 to provide health insurance coverage to millions of previously uninsured Americans through a combination of insurance market reforms, an expansion of Medicaid, subsidies and health insurance mandates. While certain provisions of the ACA have already taken effect, others have delayed effective dates or require further rulemaking action or regulatory guidance by governmental agencies to implement. In addition, various market participants continue to react to these regulatory changes. As a result, there remains uncertainty as to the full impact of ACA on our business operations. Future rulemaking or other regulatory actions under the ACA or otherwise could increase regulation of pharmacy services, result in changes to pharmacy reimbursement rates, and otherwise change the way we do business. We cannot predict the timing or impact of any future rulemaking or other regulatory actions, but any such actions could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations.A significant change in, or noncompliance with, governmental regulations and other legal requirements could have a material adverse effect on our reputation and profitability.We operate in complex, highly regulated environments in the United States and in the other countries in which we operate and could be adversely affected by changes to existing legal requirements, new legal requirements and/or any failure to comply with applicable regulations. Businesses in our Pharmaceutical Wholesale division are subject to a range of regulations relating to such things as product margins, product traceability and the conditions under which products must be stored. Our retail pharmacy and health and wellness services businesses are subject to numerous country, state and local regulations including licensing and other requirements for pharmacies and reimbursement arrangements. The regulations to which we are subject include, but are not limited to: country, and state registration and regulation of pharmacies and drug discount card programs; dispensing and sale of controlled substances and products containing pseudoephedrine; applicable governmental payer regulations including Medicare and Medicaid; data privacy and security laws and regulations including HIPAA; the ACA; laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment and health and safety matters, including those governing exposure to, and the management and disposal of, hazardous substances; regulations regarding food and drug safety including those of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), trade regulations including those of the U.S. Federal Trade Commission, and consumer protection and safety regulations including those of the Consumer Product Safety Commission, as well as state regulatory authorities, governing the availability, sale, advertisement and promotion of products we sell; anti-kickback laws; false claims laws; laws against the corporate practice of medicine; and foreign, national and state laws governing the practice of the profession of pharmacy. For example, in the United States the DEA, FDA and various other regulatory authorities regulate the distribution and dispensing of pharmaceuticals and controlled substances. We are required to hold valid DEA and state-level licenses, meet various security and operating standards and comply with the Controlled Substance Act and its accompanying regulations governing the sale, dispensing, disposal, holding and distribution of controlled substances. The DEA, FDA and state regulatory authorities have broad enforcement powers, including the ability to seize or recall products and impose significant criminal, civil and administrative sanctions for violations of these laws and regulations. We are also governed by foreign, national and state laws of general applicability, including laws regulating matters of working conditions, health and safety and equal employment opportunity and other labor and employment matters as well as competition and antitrust matters. In addition, we could have significant exposure if we are found to have infringed another partys intellectual property rights.Changes in laws, regulations and policies and the related interpretations and enforcement practices may alter the landscape in which we do business and may affect our costs of doing business. The impact of new laws, regulations and policies and the related interpretations and enforcement practices generally cannot be predicted, and changes in applicable laws, regulations and policies and the related interpretations and enforcement practices may require extensive system and operational changes, be difficult to implement, increase our operating costs and require significant capital expenditures. Untimely compliance or noncompliance with applicable laws and regulations could result in the imposition of civil and criminal penalties that could adversely affect the continued operation of our businesses, including: suspension of payments from government programs; loss of required government certifications; loss of authorizations to participate in or exclusion from government programs, including the Medicare and Medicaid programs in the United States and the National Health Service in the United Kingdom; loss of licenses; and significant fines or monetary penalties. Any failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements in the United States or in any of the countries in which we operate could result in significant legal and financial exposure, damage our reputation, and have a material adverse effect on our business operations, financial condition and results of operations.- 19 - We could be adversely affected by product liability, product recall, personal injury or other health and safety issues.We could be adversely impacted by the supply of defective products, including the infiltration of counterfeit products into the supply chain, errors in re-labelling of products, product tampering, product recall and contamination or product mishandling issues. Through our pharmacies and specialist packaging sites, we are also exposed to risks relating to the services we provide. Errors in the dispensing and packaging of pharmaceuticals could lead to serious injury or death. Product liability or personal injury claims may be asserted against us with respect to any of the products or pharmaceuticals we sell or services we provide. Our healthcare clinics also increase our exposure to professional liability claims related to medical care. Should a product or other liability issue arise, the coverage limits under our insurance programs and the indemnification amounts available to us may not be adequate to protect us against claims and judgments. We also may not be able to maintain this insurance on acceptable terms in the future. We could suffer significant reputational damage and financial liability if we, or any affiliated entities, experience any of the foregoing health and safety issues or incidents, which could have a material adverse effect on our business operations, financial condition and results of operations.We have significant outstanding debt; our debt and associated payment obligations could significantly increase in the future if we incur additional debt and do not retire existing debt.We have outstanding debt and other financial obligations and significant unused borrowing capacity. As of August 31, 2016, we had approximately $19 billion of outstanding indebtedness, including short-term borrowings. Our debt level and related debt service obligations could have negative consequences, including:##TABLE_START  requiring us to dedicate significant cash flow from operations to the payment of principal, interest and other amounts payable on our debt, which would reduce the funds we have available for other purposes, such as working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, share repurchases and dividends;##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START making it more difficult or expensive for us to obtain any necessary future financing for working capital, capital expenditures, debt service requirements, debt refinancing, acquisitions or other purposes;##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START reducing our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our industry and market conditions;##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START making us more vulnerable in the event of a downturn in our business operations; and##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START exposing us to interest rate risk given that a portion of our debt obligations is at variable interest rates.##TABLE_END We may incur or assume significantly more debt in the future, including in connection with acquisitions, strategic investments or joint ventures. For example, we incurred significant additional debt in November 2014 in connection with the Second Step Transaction and in June 2016 as part of our intended financing for the pending Rite Aid transaction. We will incur significant additional debt upon the closing of the pending Rite Aid transaction including pursuant to the 2015 Credit Agreements. See Note 9, Borrowings, to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K for additional information regarding our financing plans and arrangements. In addition, if the pending acquisition of Rite Aid is completed, the then-outstanding Rite Aid indebtedness we acquire upon closing is expected to be substantial. If we add new debt and do not retire existing debt, the risks described above could increase. We also could be adversely impacted by any failure to renew or replace, on terms acceptable to us or at all, existing funding arrangements when they expire, and any failure to satisfy applicable covenants.Our long-term debt obligations include covenants that may adversely affect our ability, and the ability of certain of our subsidiaries, to incur certain secured indebtedness or engage in certain types of transactions. In addition, our existing credit agreements require us to maintain as of the last day of each fiscal quarter a ratio of consolidated debt to total capitalization not to exceed a certain level. Our ability to comply with these restrictions and covenants may be affected by events beyond our control. If we breach any of these restrictions or covenants and do not obtain a waiver from the lenders, then, subject to applicable cure periods, our outstanding indebtedness could be declared immediately due and payable. This could have a material adverse effect on our business operations and financial condition.We could be adversely affected by downgrades to our credit ratings or disruptions in our ability to access well-functioning capital markets.- 20 - We could be adversely affected by downgrades to our credit ratings or disruptions in our ability to access well-functioning capital markets.Historically, we have relied on the public debt capital markets to fund portions of our capital investments and access to the commercial paper market and bank credit facilities as part of our working capital management strategy. Our continued access to these markets, and the terms of such access, depend on multiple factors including the condition of debt capital markets, our operating performance, and our credit ratings. The major credit rating agencies have assigned us and our corporate debt investment grade credit ratings. These ratings are based on a number of factors, which include their assessment of our financial strength and financial policies. We benefit from investment grade ratings as they serve to lower our borrowing costs and facilitate our access to a variety of lenders and other creditors, including landlords for our leased stores, on terms that we consider advantageous to our businesses. However, there can be no assurance that any particular rating assigned to us will remain in effect for any given period of time or that a rating will not be changed or withdrawn by a rating agency, if in that rating agencys judgment, future circumstances relating to the basis of the rating so warrant. Incurrence of additional debt by us, including, if the pending acquisition of Rite Aid is completed, outstanding Rite Aid indebtedness we acquire upon closing and additional debt we incur in connection with the financing of the transaction, could adversely affect our credit ratings. We depend on banks and other financial institutions to provide credit to our business and perform under our agreements with them. Defaults by one or more of these counterparties on their obligations to us could materially and adversely affect us. Any disruptions or turmoil in the capital markets or any downgrade of our credit ratings could adversely affect our cost of funds, liquidity, competitive position and access to capital markets and increase the cost of and counterparty risks associated with existing facilities, which could materially and adversely affect our business operations, financial condition, and results of operations.As a holding company, Walgreens Boots Alliance is dependent on funding from its operating subsidiaries to pay dividends and other obligations.Walgreens Boots Alliance is a holding company with no business operations of its own. Its assets primarily consist of direct and indirect ownership interests in, and its business is conducted through, subsidiaries which are separate legal entities. As a result, it is dependent on funding from its subsidiaries, including Walgreens and Alliance Boots, to meet its obligations. Additionally, Walgreens Boots Alliances subsidiaries may be restricted in their ability to pay cash dividends or to make other distributions to Walgreens Boots Alliance, which may limit the payment of cash dividends or other distributions to the holders of Walgreens Boots Alliance common stock. Credit facilities and other debt obligations of Walgreens Boots Alliance, as well as statutory provisions, may further limit the ability of Walgreens Boots Alliance and its subsidiaries to pay dividends. Payments to Walgreens Boots Alliance by its subsidiaries are also contingent upon its subsidiaries earnings and business considerations.Our quarterly results may fluctuate significantly.Our operating results have historically varied on a quarterly basis and may continue to fluctuate significantly in the future. Factors that may affect our quarterly operating results, some of which are beyond the control of management, include, but are not limited to the timing of the introduction of new generic and brand name prescription drugs; inflation, including with respect to generic drug procurement costs; the timing and severity of the cough, cold and flu season; changes in payer reimbursement rates and terms; fluctuations in inventory, energy, transportation, labor, healthcare and other costs; significant acquisitions, dispositions, joint ventures and other strategic initiatives; asset impairment charges; the relative magnitude of our LIFO provision in any particular quarter; foreign currency fluctuations; seasonality; prolonged severe weather in key markets; and many of the other risk factors discussed herein. Accordingly, we believe that quarter-to-quarter comparisons of our operating results are not necessarily meaningful and investors should not rely on the results of any particular quarter as an indication of our future performance.Our businesses are seasonal in nature, and adverse events during the holiday and cough, cold and flu seasons could adversely impact our operating results.Our businesses are seasonal in nature, with the second fiscal quarter (December, January and February) typically generating a higher proportion of retail sales and earnings than other fiscal quarters. We purchase significant amounts of seasonal inventory in anticipation of the holiday season. Adverse events, such as deteriorating economic conditions, higher unemployment, higher gas prices, public transportation disruptions, or unanticipated adverse weather, could result in lower-than-planned sales during key selling seasons. For example, frequent or unusually heavy snowfall, ice storms, rainstorms, windstorms or other extreme weather conditions over a prolonged period could make it difficult for our customers to travel to our stores and increase our snow removal and other costs. This could lead to lower sales or to unanticipated markdowns, negatively impacting our financial condition and results of operations. In addition, both prescription and non-prescription drug sales are affected by the timing and severity of the cough, cold and flu season, which can vary considerably from year to year.- 21 - We could be adversely impacted by changes in accounting standards and subjective assumptions, estimates and judgments by management related to complex accounting matters.Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) and related accounting pronouncements, implementation guidelines and interpretations with regard to a wide range of matters that are relevant to our businesses, including, but not limited to, revenue recognition, asset impairment, impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets, inventories, vendor rebates and other vendor consideration, lease obligations, self-insurance liabilities, tax matters, unclaimed property laws and litigation and other contingent liabilities are highly complex and involve many subjective assumptions, estimates and judgments. Changes in these rules or their interpretation or changes in underlying assumptions, estimates or judgments could significantly change our reported or expected financial performance or financial condition. For example, changes in accounting standards and the application of existing accounting standards particularly related to the measurement of fair value as compared to carrying value for the Companys reporting units, including goodwill, intangible assets and investments in equity interests, including investments held by our equity method investees, may have an adverse effect on the Companys financial condition and results of operations. Factors that could lead to impairment of goodwill and intangible assets include significant adverse changes in the business climate and declines in the financial condition of a reporting unit. Factors that could lead to impairment of investments in equity interests of the companies in which we invested or the investments held by those companies include a prolonged period of decline in their operating performance or adverse changes in the economic, regulatory and legal environments of the countries in which they operate in.New accounting guidance also may require systems and other changes that could increase our operating costs and/or significantly change our financial statements. For example, in February 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ) 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842), which supersedes Topic 840, Leases. This ASU, which is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2018 (fiscal 2020), seeks to increase the transparency and comparability of organizations by recognizing lease assets and lease liabilities on the balance sheet and disclosing key information about leasing arrangements. See, New Accounting Pronouncements, within Note 2, Summary of Major Accounting Policies . Implementing this ASU, as well as other future accounting guidance such as that related to revenue and other areas impacted by the current convergence project between the FASB and the International Accounting Standards Board could require us to make significant changes to our lease management system or other accounting systems, and could result in significant adverse changes to our financial statements.We have a substantial amount of goodwill and other intangible assets which could, in the future, become impaired and result in material non-cash charges to our results of operations.As of August 31, 2016, we had $25.8 billion of goodwill and other intangible assets, most of which relates to the acquisition of Alliance Boots completed on December 31, 2014. We accounted for the Second Step Transaction using the purchase method of accounting in accordance with GAAP, with the purchase price paid allocated to recognize the acquired assets and liabilities at their fair value. At least annually, or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate a potential impairment in the carrying value as defined by GAAP, we will evaluate this goodwill and other intangible assets for impairment by first assessing qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances leads to a determination that it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying amount. Estimated fair values could change if, for example, there are changes in the business climate, changes in the competitive environment, adverse legal or regulatory actions or developments, changes in capital structure, cost of debt, interest rates, capital expenditure levels, operating cash flows, or market capitalization. Because of the significance of our goodwill and intangible assets, any future impairment of these assets could require material non-cash charges to our results of operations, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.- 22 - We are exposed to risks related to litigation and other legal proceedings.We operate in a highly regulated and litigious environment. We are involved in litigation, arbitration and other legal proceedings and subject to investigations, inspections, audits, inquiries and similar actions by governmental authorities arising in the course of our businesses, including those contained in Note 12, Commitments and Contingencies to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K. Legal proceedings, in general, and securities and class action litigation, in particular, can be expensive and disruptive. Some of these suits may purport or may be determined to be class actions and/or involve parties seeking large and/or indeterminate amounts, including punitive or exemplary damages, and may remain unresolved for several years. In addition, under the qui tam or whistleblower provisions of the federal and various state false claims acts, persons may bring lawsuits alleging that a violation of the federal anti-kickback statute or similar laws has resulted in the submission of false claims to federal and/or state healthcare programs, including Medicare and Medicaid. From time to time, we are also involved in legal proceedings as a plaintiff involving antitrust, tax, contract, intellectual property and other matters. We cannot predict with certainty the outcomes of these legal proceedings and other contingencies, and the costs incurred in litigation can be substantial, regardless of the outcome. Substantial unanticipated verdicts, fines and rulings do sometimes occur. As a result, we could from time to time incur judgments, enter into settlements or revise our expectations regarding the outcome of certain matters, and such developments could harm our reputation and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in the period in which the amounts are accrued and/or our cash flows in the period in which the amounts are paid. The outcome of some of these legal proceedings and other contingencies could require us to take, or refrain from taking, actions which could negatively affect our operations. Additionally, defending against these lawsuits and proceedings may involve significant expense and diversion of managements attention and resources.We could be adversely affected by violations of anti-bribery, anti-corruption and/or international trade laws.We are subject to laws concerning our business operations and marketing activities in foreign countries where we conduct business. For example, we are subject to the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (the FCPA), U.S. export control, anti-money laundering and trade sanction laws, and similar anti-corruption and international trade laws in certain foreign countries, such as the U.K. Bribery Act, any violation of which could create substantial liability for us and also harm our reputation. The FCPA generally prohibits U.S. companies and their officers, directors, employees, and intermediaries from making improper payments to foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business abroad or otherwise obtaining favorable treatment. The FCPA also requires that U.S. public companies maintain books and records that fairly and accurately reflect transactions and maintain an adequate system of internal accounting controls. If we are found to have violated the FCPA, or any other anti-bribery, anti-corruption or international trade laws, we may face sanctions including civil and criminal fines, disgorgement of profits, and suspension or debarment of our ability to contract with governmental agencies or receive export licenses. In addition, new initiatives may be proposed from time to time that impact the trading conditions in certain countries or regions, and may include retaliatory duties or trade sanctions which, if enacted, could adversely impact our trading relationships with vendors or other parties in such locations and have a material adverse effect on our operations. From time to time, we may face audits or investigations by one or more domestic or foreign governmental agencies relating to our international business activities, compliance with which could be costly and time-consuming, and could divert our management and key personnel from our business operations. An adverse outcome under any such investigation or audit could damage our reputation and subject us to fines or other penalties, which could materially and adversely affect our business operations, financial condition, and results of operations.We could be subject to adverse changes in tax laws, regulations and interpretations or challenges to our tax positions.We are a large corporation with operations in the United States and numerous other jurisdictions around the world. As such, we are subject to tax laws and regulations of the United States federal, state and local governments as well as various foreign jurisdictions. We compute our income tax provision based on enacted tax rates in the jurisdictions in which we operate. As the tax rates vary among jurisdictions, a change in earnings attributable to the various jurisdictions in which we operate could result in an unfavorable change in our overall tax provision. From time to time, legislative initiatives are proposed that could adversely affect our tax positions, effective tax rate, tax payments or financial condition. In addition, tax laws are complex and subject to varying interpretations and any significant failure to comply with applicable tax laws and regulations in all relevant jurisdictions could give rise to substantial penalties and liabilities. Any change in enacted tax laws, rules or regulatory or judicial interpretations, any adverse outcome in connection with tax audits in any jurisdiction or any change in the pronouncements relating to accounting for income taxes could adversely affect our effective tax rate, tax payments and results of operations.Our insurance programs may expose us to unexpected costs.We use a combination of insurance and self-insurance to provide for potential liability for workers compensation; automobile and general liability; property, director and officers liability; and employee healthcare benefits. Provisions for losses related to self-insured risks generally are based upon actuarially determined estimates. Any actuarial projection of losses is subject to a high degree of variability. Changes in legal claims, trends and interpretations, variability in inflation rates, changes in the nature and method of claims settlement, benefit level changes due to changes in applicable laws, insolvency of insurance carriers, and changes in discount rates could all materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.- 23 - We could be adversely impacted by changes in assumptions used in calculating pension assets and liabilities.We operate certain defined benefit pension plans in the United Kingdom, which were closed to new entrants in 2010, as well as smaller plans in other jurisdictions. The valuation of the pension plans assets and liabilities depends in part on assumptions, which are primarily based on the financial markets as well as longevity and employee retention rates. This valuation is particularly sensitive to material changes in the value of equity, bond and other investments held by the pension plans, changes in the corporate bond yields which are used in the measurement of the liabilities, changes in market expectations for long-term price inflation, and new evidence on projected longevity rates. Funding requirements and the impact on the statement of earnings relating to these pension plans are also influenced by these factors. Adverse changes in the assumptions used to calculate the value of pension assets and liabilities, including lower than expected pension fund investment returns and/or increased life expectancy of plan participants, or regulatory change could require us to increase the funding of its defined benefit pension plans or incur higher expenses, which would adversely impact our results of operations and financial position.Certain stockholders may have significant voting influence over matters requiring stockholder approval.As of August 31, 2016, affiliates of Stefano Pessina, our Executive Vice Chairman and Chief Executive Officer (the SP Investors), had sole or shared voting power, directly or indirectly, over an aggregate of approximately 13 % of our outstanding common stock. The SP Investors have agreed to, for so long as they have the right to designate a nominee for election to the Board, to vote all of their shares of common stock in accordance with the Boards recommendation on matters submitted to a vote of the Companys stockholders (including with respect to the election of directors). The SP Investors significant interest in our common stock potentially could determine the outcome of matters submitted to a vote by our stockholders. The influence of the SP Investors could result in our taking actions that other stockholders do not support or failing to take actions that other stockholders support. As a result, the market price of our common stock could be adversely affected.Shares issued to former Alliance Boots stockholders in connection with our strategic combination with Alliance Boots are eligible for future sale.We issued a total of 227.7 million shares of our common stock to former Alliance Boots shareholders in connection with our strategic combination with Alliance Boots, which was completed in December 2014. These shares generally may now be sold pursuant to Rule 144 under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act), subject to restrictions in the case of shares held by persons deemed to be our affiliates and to certain obligations pursuant to a shareholders agreement (as amended, the Company Shareholders Agreement) with certain of the SP Investors and certain affiliates of Kohlberg Kravis Roberts  Co. L.P. (KKR, and together with certain of its affiliates, the KKR Investors). In February 2016, a shelf registration statement under the Securities Act registering an aggregate of 58.4 million shares of the KKR Investors and certain other stockholders became effective upon filing with the SEC. The KKR Investors sold an aggregate of 30 million of the shares registered in underwritten offerings completed in May 2016 and August 2016. Sales of the remaining shares available for future sale under this shelf registration statement may be made from time to time in the future, subject to certain obligations pursuant to the Company Shareholders Agreement. In addition, the Company Shareholders Agreement also contains registration rights that would obligate us, in certain instances, to file future registration statements under the Securities Act covering resales of shares issued to former Alliance Boots stockholders or to permit a piggyback on a future registration statement. A sale, or the perception that a sale may occur, of a substantial number of shares of our common stock could adversely impact the market price of our common stock.Conflicts of interest, or the appearance of conflicts of interest, may arise because certain of our directors and officers are also owners or directors of companies we may have dealings with.Conflicts of interest, or the appearance of conflicts of interest, could arise between our interests and the interests of the other entities and business activities in which our directors or officers are involved. For example, potential conflicts of interest could arise if a dispute were to arise between the Company and other parties to the Company Shareholders Agreement, including the SP Investors and the KKR Investors. Mr. Pessina, our Executive Vice Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, indirectly controls Alliance Sant Participations S.A. (ASP), a privately-held company which is a party to the Company Shareholders Agreement, and he and his partner Ornella Barra, our Co-Chief Operating Officer, serve as directors of ASP. Similar potential conflicts could arise if a dispute were to arise with the KKR Investors, as Dominic Murphy is both a partner of KKR and one of our directors. Similar issues could arise in connection with other transactions in the future. While our contractual arrangements place restrictions on the parties conduct in certain situations, and related party transactions are subject to independent review and approval in accordance with our related party transaction approval procedures and applicable law, the potential for a conflict of interest exists and such persons may have conflicts of interest, or the appearance of conflicts of interest, with respect to matters involving or affecting both companies.- 24 - Our certificate of incorporation and bylaws, Delaware law and/or our agreements with certain stockholders may impede the ability of our stockholders to make changes to our Board or impede a takeover.Certain provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws, as well as provisions of the Delaware General Corporation Law (the DGCL), could make it difficult for stockholders to change the composition of the Board or discourage, delay, or prevent a merger, consolidation, or acquisitions that stockholders may otherwise consider favorable. These provisions include the authorization of the issuance of blank check preferred stock that could be issued by the Board, limitations on the ability of stockholders to call special meetings, and advance notice requirements for nomination for election to the Board or for proposing matters that can be acted upon by stockholders at stockholder meetings. We are also subject to the provisions of Section 203 of the DGCL, which prohibits us, except under specified circumstances, from engaging in any mergers, significant sales of stock or assets, or business combinations with any stockholder or group of stockholders who own 15% or more of our common stock.Under the Company Shareholders Agreement, the SP Investors are entitled to designate one nominee to the Board (currently Stefano Pessina) for so long as the SP Investors continue to meet certain beneficial ownership thresholds and subject to certain other conditions. Pursuant to the Company Shareholders Agreement, the SP Investors have agreed that, for so long as they have the right to designate a nominee to the Board, they will vote all of their shares of common stock in accordance with the Boards recommendation on matters submitted to a vote of our stockholders (including with respect to the election of directors).While these provisions do not make us immune from takeovers or changes in the composition of the Board, and are intended to protect our stockholders from, among other things, coercive or otherwise unfair tactics, these provisions could have the effect of making it difficult for stockholders to change the composition of the Board or discouraging, delaying, or preventing a merger, consolidation, or acquisitions that stockholders may otherwise consider favorable. See also the risk factor captioned Certain stockholders may have significant voting influence over matters requiring stockholder approval above.The market price of our common stock may be volatile.The market price of shares of our common stock may be volatile. Broad general economic, political, market and industry factors may adversely affect the market price of the shares, regardless of our actual operating performance. In addition to the other risk factors identified in this Item 1A, factors that could cause fluctuations in the price of the shares include: ##TABLE_START  actual or anticipated variations in quarterly operating results and the results of competitors;##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START changes in financial estimates by us or by any securities analysts that might cover us;##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START conditions or trends in the industry, including regulatory changes or changes in the securities marketplace;##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START announcements by us or our competitors of significant acquisitions, strategic partnerships or divestitures;##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START announcements of investigations or regulatory scrutiny of our operations or lawsuits filed against us;##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START additions or departures of key personnel; and##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START issuances or sales of our common stock, including sales of shares by our directors and officers or key investors, including the SP Investors and the KKR Investors.##TABLE_END There are a number of additional business risks that could materially and adversely affect our businesses and financial results.Many other factors could materially and adversely affect our businesses and financial results, including:- 25 - ##TABLE_START If we are unsuccessful in establishing effective advertising, marketing and promotional programs, our sales or sales margins could be negatively affected.##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START Our operating costs may be subject to increases outside the control of our businesses, whether due to inflation, new or increased taxes, adverse fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, changes in market conditions or otherwise.##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START Our success depends on our ability to attract, engage and retain store, professional and management personnel, including in executive and other key strategic positions, and the loss of key personnel could have an adverse effect on the results of our operations, financial condition or cash flow.##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START Natural disasters, civil unrest, severe weather conditions, terrorist activities, global political and economic developments, war, health epidemics or pandemics or the prospect of these events can interrupt or otherwise adversely impact our operations or damage our facilities or those of our strategic partners, vendors and customers and have an adverse impact on consumer confidence levels and spending on our products and services.##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START If we or our affiliates were to incur significant liabilities or expense relating to the protection of the environment, related health and safety matters, environmental remediation or compliance with environmental laws and regulations, including those governing exposure to, and the management and disposal of, hazardous substances, it could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flow.##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START The long-term effects of climate change on general economic conditions and the pharmacy industry in particular are unclear, and changes in the supply, demand or available sources of energy and the regulatory and other costs associated with energy production and delivery may affect the availability or cost of goods and services, including natural resources, necessary to run our businesses.##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START If negative publicity, even if unwarranted, related to safety or quality, human and workplace rights, or other issues damage our brand image and corporate reputation, or that of our vendors or strategic allies, our businesses may suffer.##TABLE_END ", "1B": " Item 1B.

Our Retail Pharmacy USA division also operated two prescription mail service facilities containing a total of approximately 237 thousand square feet, one of which was leased. We operated 288 pharmaceutical distribution centers located outside of the United States, primarily in Europe, and containing approximately 13 million square feet, of which 122 locations were owned.

Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read together with the financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere herein and the description of the Companys business and reportable segments in Item 1 above. This discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results may differ materially from those discussed in forward-looking statements. Factors that might cause a difference include, but are not limited to, those discussed under Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements below and in Risk Factors in Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K. References herein to the Company, we, us, or our refer to Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. and its subsidiaries from and after the effective time of the Reorganization on December 31, 2014 and, prior to that time, to its predecessor Walgreen Co. and its subsidiaries, and in each case do not include unconsolidated partially-owned entities, except as otherwise indicated or the context otherwise requires.INTRODUCTION On December 31, 2014, Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. (Walgreens Boots Alliance) became the successor to Walgreen Co. (Walgreens) pursuant to a merger to effect a reorganization of Walgreens into a holding company structure (the Reorganization), with Walgreens Boots Alliance becoming the parent holding company. Pursuant to the Reorganization, Walgreens became a wholly owned subsidiary of Walgreens Boots Alliance, a Delaware corporation formed for the purposes of the Reorganization, and each issued and outstanding share of Walgreens common stock converted on a one-to-one basis into Walgreens Boots Alliance common stock. Also on December 31, 2014, following the completion of the Reorganization, Walgreens Boots Alliance completed the acquisition of the remaining 55% of Alliance Boots GmbH (Alliance Boots) that Walgreens did not previously own (the Second Step Transaction) in exchange for 3.133 billion in cash and 144.3 million shares of Walgreens Boots Alliance common stock. Alliance Boots became a consolidated subsidiary and ceased being accounted for under the equity method immediately upon completion of the Second Step Transaction. For financial reporting and accounting purposes, Walgreens Boots Alliance was the acquirer of Alliance Boots. The consolidated financial statements (and other data, such as prescriptions filled) reflect the results of operations and financial position of Walgreens and its subsidiaries for periods prior to December 31, 2014 and of Walgreens Boots Alliance and its subsidiaries for periods from and after the effective time of the Reorganization on December 31, 2014.On October 27, 2015, Walgreens Boots Alliance entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger with Rite Aid Corporation (Rite Aid) and Victoria Merger Sub, Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of Walgreens Boots Alliance (the Merger Agreement), pursuant to which we agreed, subject to the terms and conditions thereof, to acquire Rite Aid, a drugstore chain in the United States with 4,550 stores in 31 states and the District of Columbia as of August 27, 2016. The Merger Agreement was approved by Rite Aid stockholders in February 2016. The transaction is expected to close in early calendar year 2017 , subject to regulatory approvals and other customary closing conditions . COMPARABILITY As a result of the completion of the Second Step Transaction on December 31, 2014, there are a number of items that affect comparability of reported results. Prior to December 31, 2014, our operations were within one reportable segment that included the results of the Retail Pharmacy USA division and corporate costs, along with the full consolidated results of Walgreens Boots Alliance Development GmbH (WBAD), a global sourcing enterprise formed by Walgreens and Alliance Boots, and equity earnings from Alliance Boots. Following the completion of the Reorganization and the Second Step Transaction on December 31, 2014, we now report results in three segments. Segmental reporting includes the allocation of synergy benefits, including WBADs results, and the combined corporate costs for periods subsequent to December 31, 2014. We have determined that it is impracticable to allocate historical results to the current segmental presentation. Accordingly, our Retail Pharmacy USA segment results for periods prior to December 31, 2014 include all corporate costs of Walgreens, the full consolidated results of WBAD and equity income from Walgreens pre-merger 45% interest in Alliance Boots.The completion of the Second Step Transaction on December 31, 2014 also means that results for the twelve month period ended August 31, 2016 include the results of Alliance Boots on a fully consolidated basis, while the twelve month period ended August 31, 2015 includes the results of Alliance Boots for eight months (January through August 2015) on a fully consolidated basis and as equity income from Walgreens pre-merger 45% interest in Alliance Boots for four months (September through December 2014).- 32 - Twelve month period-over-period comparisons of results require consideration of the foregoing factors and are not directly comparable.In addition, our sales results are affected by a number of factors, including our sales performance during holiday periods and during the cough, cold and flu season; foreign currency fluctuations; significant weather conditions; timing of our own or competitor discount programs and pricing actions; levels of reimbursement from governmental agencies and other third party payers; and general economic conditions in the markets in which we operate.To improve comparability, certain classification changes have been made to prior period sales, cost of sales and selling, general and administrative expenses. This change has no impact on operating income.AMERISOURCEBERGEN CORPORATION RELATIONSHIP In March 2013, Walgreens, Alliance Boots and AmerisourceBergen announced various agreements and arrangements, including a ten-year pharmaceutical distribution agreement between Walgreens and AmerisourceBergen pursuant to which branded and generic pharmaceutical products are sourced from AmerisourceBergen in the United States and an agreement which provides AmerisourceBergen the ability to access generics pharmaceutical products through WBAD. In May 2016, certain of these agreements were extended for three years to now expire in 2026.In addition, in March 2013, Walgreens, Alliance Boots and AmerisourceBergen entered into agreements and arrangements pursuant to which we have the right, but not the obligation, to purchase a minority equity position in AmerisourceBergen over time through open market purchases and pursuant to warrants to acquire AmerisourceBergen common stock and gain associated representation on AmerisourceBergens board of directors in certain circumstances. Please refer to our Form 8-K filed on March 20, 2013 for more detailed information regarding these agreements and arrangements. On March 18, 2016, we exercised warrants to purchase 22,696,912 shares of AmerisourceBergen common stock at an exercise price of $51.50 per share for an aggregate exercise price payment of $1.17 billion. On August 25, 2016, we exercised additional warrants to purchase 22,696,912 shares of AmerisourceBergen common stock at an exercise price of $52.50 per share for an aggregate exercise price payment of $1.19 billion. As of August 31, 2016 we owned 56,854,867 AmerisourceBergen common shares representing approximately 24% of the outstanding AmerisourceBergen common stock and had designated one member of AmerisourceBergens board of directors. As of August 31, 2016, we can acquire up to an additional 8,398,752 AmerisourceBergen shares in the open market and thereafter designate another member of AmerisourceBergens board of directors, subject in each case to applicable legal and contractual requirements. The amount of permitted open market purchases is subject to increase or decrease in certain circumstances.Effective March 18, 2016, we account for our investment in AmerisourceBergen using the equity method of accounting, subject to a two-month reporting lag, with the net earnings attributable to our investment being classified within the operating income of our Pharmaceutical Wholesale segment. See Note 5, Equity Method Investments, to the Consolidated Financial Statements included herein for further information. Due to the March 18, 2016 effective date and the two-month reporting lag, our results for the 12 month period ended August 31, 2016 include approximately three and a half months of equity method income relating to our investment in AmerisourceBergen. Similarly, due to the timing of the transaction and the two month reporting lag, our results for the fiscal quarter ended November 30, 2016 will include approximately five weeks of equity income reflecting our increased ownership following the exercise on August 25, 2016 of the second tranche of warrants.RESTRUCTURING PROGRAMS On April 8, 2015, the Walgreens Boots Alliance Board of Directors approved a plan to implement a new restructuring program (the Cost Transformation Program) as part of an initiative to reduce costs and increase operating efficiencies. The Cost Transformation Program implements and builds on the planned three-year, $1.0 billion cost-reduction initiative previously announced by Walgreens on August 6, 2014 and includes a number of elements designed to help achieve profitable growth through increased cost efficiencies. We have identified additional opportunities for cost savings that increase the total expected cost savings of the Cost Transformation Program by $500 million to a projected $1.5 billion by the end of fiscal 2017. Significant areas of focus include plans to close approximately 200 stores across the U.S.; reorganize divisional and field operations; drive operating efficiencies; and streamline information technology and other functions. The actions under the Cost Transformation Program focus primarily on our Retail Pharmacy USA segment, and are expected to be substantially completed by the end of fiscal 2017.- 33 - As of the date of this report, the Company estimates that the Cost Transformation Program will recognize cumulative pre-tax charges to our financial results in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America (GAAP) of between $1.3 billion and $1.5 billion , which is $300 million lower than the previously estimated range of pre-tax charges at the time the Cost Transformation Program was launched), including costs associated with lease obligations and other real estate payments, asset impairments and employee termination and other business transition and exit costs. As of the date of this report, we expect to incur pre-tax charges of between $425 million and $500 million for real estate costs, including lease obligations (net of estimated sublease income); between $525 million and $575 million for asset impairment charges relating primarily to asset write-offs from store closures, information technology, inventory and other non-operational real estate asset write-offs; and between $ 350 million and $ 425 million for employee severance and other business transition and exit costs. We estimate that approximately 60 % of the cumulative pre-tax charges will result in cash expenditures over time , primarily related to historical and future lease and other real estate payments and employee separation costs. See Note 3, Restructuring, to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.The amounts and timing of all estimates are subject to change until finalized. The actual amounts and timing may vary materially based on various factors. See Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements below.EXECUTIVE SUMMARY The following table presents certain key financial statistics for the Company for fiscal 2016, 2015 and 2014.##TABLE_START   (in millions, except per share amounts)   2016  2015 (1)   2014 (1)  Sales $117,351  $103,444  $76,392 Gross Profit  29,874   26,753   21,569 Selling, general and administrative expenses  23,910   22,400   17,992 Operating Income  6,001   4,668   4,194 Adjusted Operating Income (Non-GAAP measure) (2)   7,208   6,157   4,866 Earnings Before Interest and Income Tax Provision  5,740   5,916   3,713 Net Earnings Attributable to Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc.  4,173   4,220   1,932 Adjusted Net Earnings Attributable to Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc.

The decreases reflect fluctuations in the fair value adjustments of the companys AmerisourceBergen warrants and the prior year gain on the previously held equity interest in Alliance Boots, which was largely offset by the inclusion of Alliance Boots consolidated results for the entire period and an increase in operating income at Retail Pharmacy USA.Other income (expense) for fiscal 2016 was an expense of $261 million as compared to income of $685 million in fiscal 2015. The change in fair value of our AmerisourceBergen warrants resulted in a loss of $546 million for fiscal 2016, as compared to income of $759 million for fiscal 2015. Additionally, we recognized income of $268 million for fiscal year ended 2016 related to the change in accounting method for our investment in AmerisourceBergen. Interest was a net expense of $596 million and $605 million in fiscal 2016 and 2015, respectively. Fiscal 2016 included interest expense on notes issued during June 2016. Fiscal 2015 included interest expense of $99 million related to the repayment of a portion of our long-term debt in advance of its maturity.The effective tax rate for fiscal 2016 and 2015 was 19.4% and 19.9%, respectively. The net decrease in the effective tax rate is attributable to several factors. First, our 2016 effective tax rate benefited from having a full-year of foreign sourced pre-tax earnings taxed at lower rates as compared to 2015, when the Company had only eight months of those earnings after the Second Step Transaction. Further, in 2016 our domestic pre-tax earnings were reduced as a result of the AmerisourceBergen warrants then held by the Company. In addition, during 2016 the Company benefitted from enacted tax law changes (tax rate reductions) in multiple foreign tax jurisdictions, most notably the United Kingdom, which generated a $178 million tax benefit. The Company also had fewer non-deductible expenses in 2016 as compared to 2015. These items were partly offset by the facts that in 2015 the Company had a non-taxable gain on its previously held equity investment in Alliance Boots and recognized the benefit of a capital loss deferred tax asset, neither of which recurred in 2016.Walgreens Boots Alliance Adjusted Diluted Net Earnings Per Share (Non-GAAP measure) Adjusted net earnings attributable to Walgreens Boots Alliance in fiscal 2016 increased 22.6 percent to $5.0 billion compared with the prior year. Adjusted diluted net earnings per share in the fiscal year increased 18.3 percent to $4.59 compared with the prior year. The increase in adjusted net earnings and adjusted diluted net earnings per share for fiscal 2016 was primarily attributable to inclusion of Alliance Boots consolidated results for the entire period and an increase in operating income at Retail Pharmacy USA. See --Non-GAAP Measures below for a reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP measure.Fiscal 2015 compared to fiscal 2014 Our results for fiscal 2015 as compared to fiscal 2014 were primarily impacted by the Second Step Transaction which resulted in the full consolidation of Alliance Boots results of operations beginning December 31, 2014. For fiscal 2015, the full consolidation of Alliance Boots operations increased our sales by 29.4%, gross profit by 22.9%, selling general and administrative expenses by 23.1% and operating income by 18.5%, each as compared to fiscal 2014. See -- Comparability above.- 35 - Net earnings attributable to Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. for fiscal 2015 were $4.2 billion, or $4.00 per share on a diluted basis as compared to $1.9 billion, or $2.00 per share on a diluted basis in fiscal 2014. The increase in diluted net earnings per share for fiscal 2015 as compared to fiscal 2014, was primarily attributable to the full consolidation of Alliance Boots operations from January through August 2015, a gain on our 45% previously held equity interest in Alliance Boots, increased sales in our Retail Pharmacy USA division, increased income from our warrants to acquire AmerisourceBergen common stock and a lower effective income tax rate. These increases were partially offset by lower Retail Pharmacy USA gross margins and a higher interest expense.As a result of acquiring the remaining 55% interest in Alliance Boots on December 31, 2014, our previously held 45% interest was remeasured to fair value, resulting in a gain of $563 million in fiscal 2015. The fair value of the previously held equity interest in Alliance Boots was determined using the income approach methodology. The fair value measurement of the previously held equity interest is based on significant inputs not observable in the market. The fair value estimates for the previously held equity interest are based on (a) projected discounted cash flows, (b) historical and projected financial information, and (c) synergies including cost savings, as relevant, that market participants would consider when estimating the fair value of the previously held equity interest in Alliance Boots. See Note 7. Acquisitions, to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.Other income (expense) for fiscal 2015 was income of $685 million as compared to expense of $481 million in fiscal 2014. The change in fair value of our AmerisourceBergen warrants resulted in recording income of $759 million and $366 million in fiscal 2015 and 2014, respectively. The increase in fair value was primarily attributed to the change in the price of AmerisourceBergens common stock. In addition, we recorded $20 million and $19 million in fiscal 2015 and 2014, respectively, of other income relating to the amortization of the deferred credit associated with the initial value of the Walgreens warrants. We have also recorded a loss of $94 million in fiscal 2015 on derivative contracts that were not designated as accounting hedges. The losses primarily relate to foreign currency forward contracts entered into in consideration of the delivery of foreign cash consideration related to the Second Step Transaction. Fiscal 2014 results also included a loss of $866 million related to the Alliance Boots call option. Upon the amendment and immediate exercise of the call option to acquire the remaining 55% ownership of Alliance Boots, we were required to compare the fair value of the amended option with the book value of the original option. The fair value of the amended option was estimated to be zero based on its valuation as a financial instrument without regard for its strategic value. The reduction in value was primarily due to the shorter duration of the amended option and the appreciation since the original valuation in the price of Walgreens stock used as partial consideration for the purchase of the remaining 55% ownership interest in Alliance Boots. Interest was a net expense of $605 million and $156 million in fiscal 2015 and 2014, respectively. The increase in fiscal 2015 interest expense is primarily due to the notes we issued to fund a portion of the cash consideration payable in connection with the Second Step Transaction and to subsequently refinance substantially all of Alliance Boots outstanding borrowings following completion of the Second Step Transaction. Additionally, in fiscal 2015 we repaid a portion of our long-term debt in advance of its maturity resulting in additional net interest expense of $99 million.The effective tax rate for fiscal 2015 and 2014 was 19.9% and 42.9%, respectively. The decrease in the fiscal 2015 effective tax rate as compared to fiscal 2014 is primarily attributable to recording discrete tax benefits related to previously unrecognized capital loss deferred tax assets as a result of recognizing capital gain income from fiscal 2015 and anticipated future period sale-leaseback transactions. In addition, as a result of our acquisition of the remaining 55% interest in Alliance Boots that we did not previously own, our annual effective tax rate decreased due to incremental foreign source income taxed at lower rates and additional favorable permanent book-tax differences. Also as a result of the acquisition, we recognized a non-recurring tax benefit that also lowered our annual effective tax rate. In addition, we recognized other, net discrete tax benefits in the current fiscal year.- 36 - RESULTS OF OPERATIONS BY SEGMENT Retail Pharmacy USAAs a result of the completion of the Second Step Transaction, the Company ceased recording equity earnings in Alliance Boots as of December 31, 2014. As such, the fiscal year ended August 31, 2015 includes equity income from Walgreens pre-merger 45% interest in Alliance Boots for four months (September through December 2014).##TABLE_START   (in millions, except location amounts)   2016  2015  2014 Sales $83,802  $80,974  $76,392 Gross Profit  22,323   21,822   21,569 Selling, general and administrative expenses  17,918   18,247   17,992 Operating Income  4,405   3,890   4,194 Adjusted Operating Income (Non-GAAP measure) (1)   5,357   5,098   4,866              Number of Prescriptions (2)   740.1   723.2   698.9 30-Day Equivalent Prescriptions (2)(3)   928.5   893.8   856.4 Number of Locations at period end  8,184   8,182   8,309 ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START   Percentage Increases (Decreases)   2016  2015  2014 Sales  3.5   6.0   5.8 Gross Profit  2.3   1.2   2.1 Selling, general and administrative expenses  (1.8)  1.4   2.6 Operating Income  13.2   (7.2)  2.5 Adjusted Operating Income (Non-GAAP measure) (1)   5.1   4.8   0.8 Comparable Store Sales (4)(5)   3.8   6.4   4.9 Pharmacy Sales  5.5   8.2   7.9 Comparable Pharmacy Sales (4)(5)   6.0   9.3   6.8 Retail Sales  (0.3)  1.9   2.1 Comparable Retail Sales (4)(5)   (0.3)  1.5   2.0 Comparable Number of Prescriptions (2)(4)(5)   2.3   3.5   1.8 Comparable 30-Day Equivalent Prescriptions (2)(3)(4)(5)   4.0   4.6   3.9 ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START   Percent to Sales   2016  2015  2014 Gross Margin  26.6   26.9   28.2 Selling, general and administrative expenses  21.4   22.5   23.6 ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START (1) See --Non-GAAP Measures below for a reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP measure and related disclosures.##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START (2) Includes immunizations.##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START (3) Includes the adjustment to convert prescriptions greater than 84 days to the equivalent of three 30-day prescriptions.

Relocated and acquired stores are not included as comparable stores for the first twelve months after the relocation or acquisition. The method of calculating comparable sales varies across the retail industry. As a result, our method of calculating comparable sales may not be the same as other retailers methods.##TABLE_END Sales fiscal 2016 compared to fiscal 2015 The Retail Pharmacy USA divisions sales for fiscal 2016 increased by 3.5% to $83.8 billion. Sales increased primarily due to higher comparable store sales, which were up 3.8% in fiscal 2016 driven by growth in Medicare Part D prescriptions, partially offset by the impact from the sale of a majority interest in our infusion business in fiscal 2015. We operated 8,184 locations (8,175 drugstores) as of August 31, 2016, compared to 8,182 locations (8,173 drugstores) a year earlier.- 37 - Pharmacy sales increased by 5.5% in fiscal 2016 and represented 67.4% of the divisions sales. In fiscal 2015, pharmacy sales were up 8.2% and represented 66.1% of the divisions sales. Comparable pharmacy sales increased 6.0% in fiscal 2016 compared to an increase of 9.3% in fiscal 2015. The effect of generic drugs, which have a lower retail price, replacing brand name drugs reduced prescription sales by 1.9% in fiscal 2016 versus a reduction of 1.8% in fiscal 2015. The effect of generics on division sales was a reduction of 1.1% in fiscal 2016 compared to a reduction of 1.0% for fiscal 2015. Third party sales, where reimbursement is received from managed care organizations, governmental agencies, employers or private insurers, were 97.4% of prescription sales for fiscal 2016 compared to 96.8% for fiscal 2015. The total number of prescriptions (including immunizations) filled in fiscal 2016 was 740.1 million compared to 723.2 million in fiscal 2015. Prescriptions (including immunizations) adjusted to 30-day equivalents were 928.5 million in fiscal 2016 versus 893.8 million in fiscal 2015.Retail sales decreased 0.3% in fiscal 2016 and were 32.6% of the divisions sales. In comparison, fiscal 2015 retail sales increased 1.9% and comprised 33.9% of the divisions sales. Comparable retail sales decreased 0.3% in fiscal 2016 compared to an increase of 1.5% in fiscal 2015. The decrease in comparable retail sales growth in the current fiscal year was primarily due to weakness in consumables and general merchandise, which was partially offset by increased sales in health and wellness, and photo categories.Operating Income fiscal 2016 compared to fiscal 2015 Retail Pharmacy USA divisions operating income for fiscal 2016 increased 13.2% to $4.4 billion. The increase is primarily due to higher pharmacy volume and lower selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales.Gross margin as a percent of sales was 26.6% in fiscal 2016 compared to 26.9% in fiscal 2015. Pharmacy margins were negatively impacted in the current fiscal year by lower third-party reimbursements . The decrease in pharmacy margins was partially offset by the favorable impact of procurement efficiencies. Retail margins were negatively impacted in the current period primarily from performance in seasonal, consumables and general merchandise categories , partially offset by performance in health and wellness, beauty and photo categories.Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales were 21.4% in fiscal 2016 compared to 22.5% in fiscal 2015. As a percentage of sales, expenses in the current period were lower primarily due to increased efficiencies and cost controls associated with the Cost Transformation Program.Adjusted Operating Income (Non-GAAP measure) fiscal 2016 compared to fiscal 2015 Retail Pharmacy USA divisions adjusted operating income for fiscal 2016 increased 5.1% to $5.4 billion. The increase is primarily due to higher pharmacy volume and lower selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales. See --Non-GAAP Measures below for a reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP measure.Sales fiscal 2015 compared to fiscal 2014 The Retail Pharmacy USA divisions sales for fiscal 2015 increased by 6.0% to $81.0 billion. Sales increased primarily due to higher comparable store sales, which were up 6.4% in fiscal 2015. We operated 8,182 locations (8,173 drugstores) as of August 31, 2015, compared to 8,309 locations (8,207 drugstores) a year earlier. Prior years locations included 91 infusion and respiratory services facilities in which we sold a majority interest in fiscal 2015.Pharmacy sales increased by 8.2% in fiscal 2015 and represented 66.1% of the divisions sales. In fiscal 2014, pharmacy sales were up 7.9% and represented 64.2% of the divisions sales. Comparable pharmacy sales increased 9.3% in fiscal 2015 compared to an increase of 6.8% in fiscal 2014. The effect of generic drugs, which have a lower retail price, replacing brand name drugs reduced prescription sales by 1.8% in fiscal 2015 versus a reduction of 1.3% in fiscal 2014. The effect of generics on division sales was a reduction of 1.0% in fiscal 2015 compared to a reduction of 0.7% for fiscal 2014. Third party sales, where reimbursement is received from managed care organizations, governmental agencies, employers or private insurers, were 96.8% of prescription sales for fiscal 2015 compared to 96.5% for fiscal 2014. The total number of prescriptions (including immunizations) filled in fiscal 2015 was 723.2 million compared to 698.9 million in fiscal 2014. Prescriptions (including immunizations) adjusted to 30-day equivalents were 893.8 million in fiscal 2015 versus 856.4 million in fiscal 2014.- 38 - Retail sales increased 1.9% in fiscal 2015 and were 33.9% of the divisions sales. In comparison, fiscal 2014 retail sales increased 2.1% and comprised 35.8% of the divisions sales. Comparable retail sales increased 1.5% in fiscal 2015 compared to an increase of 2.0% in fiscal 2014. The increase in comparable retail sales in fiscal 2015 as compared to fiscal 2014 was primarily attributed to an increase in basket size partially offset by lower customer traffic.Operating Income fiscal 2015 compared to fiscal 2014 Retail Pharmacy USA divisions operating income for fiscal 2015 decreased 7.2% to $3.9 billion. The decrease is primarily due to having equity earnings in Alliance Boots for four months in the current year versus twelve months in the comparable period and current year costs related to the Cost Transformation Program.Gross margin as a percent of sales was 26.9% in fiscal 2015 compared to 28.2% in fiscal 2014. Pharmacy margins were negatively impacted in the current fiscal year by lower third-party reimbursements; an increase in Medicare Part D mix; the strategy to continue driving 90-day prescriptions at retail; and the mix of specialty drugs, which carry a lower margin percentage. The decrease in pharmacy margins was partially offset by additional brand-to-generic drug conversions compared with the prior fiscal year. Retail margins were positively impacted in fiscal 2015 primarily from the non-prescription drug, beauty and beverage and snack categories partially offset by the electronics category.Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales were 22.5% in fiscal 2015 compared to 23.6% in fiscal 2014. As a percentage of sales, expenses in fiscal 2015 were lower primarily due to store labor efficiencies partially offset by higher costs related to the Cost Transformation Program.Adjusted Operating Income (Non-GAAP measure) fiscal 2015 compared to fiscal 2014 Retail Pharmacy USA divisions adjusted operating income for fiscal 2015 increased 4.8% to $5.1 billion. The increase is primarily due to higher sales and lower selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales partially offset by having four months of equity earnings in Alliance Boots in fiscal 2015 versus twelve months in fiscal 2014 and lower gross margins. See --Non-GAAP Measures below for reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP measure.Retail Pharmacy InternationalThe businesses included in our Retail Pharmacy International division were acquired as part of the Second Step Transaction. The Retail Pharmacy International divisions results, including the increases in sales, gross profit, selling, general and administrative expenses and operating income for fiscal 2016 as compared to the comparable prior year was primarily impacted by the Second Step Transaction, which resulted in the full consolidation of Alliance Boots results of operations beginning December 31, 2014. Accordingly, the results for this segment for fiscal 2016 include the results of Alliance Boots on a fully consolidated basis, while fiscal 2015 results include only eight months (January through August 2015) on a fully consolidated basis, and such results are not directly comparable. Results include the effects of foreign currency exchange rates, including the British Pound, Euro, Chilean Peso and Mexican Peso. To improve comparability, certain classification changes have been made to prior period results. This change has no impact on operating income.

Short-term investment objectives are primarily to minimize risk and maintain liquidity. To attain these objectives, investment limits are placed on the amount, type and issuer of securities. Investments are principally in U.S. Treasury money market funds and AAA-rated money market funds.Our long-term capital policy is to maintain a strong balance sheet and financial flexibility, reinvest in our core strategies, invest in strategic opportunities that reinforce our core strategies and meet return requirements, and return surplus cash flow to stockholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases over the long term. Cash provided by operations and the issuance of debt are the principal sources of funds for expansion, investments, acquisitions, remodeling programs, dividends to stockholders and stock repurchases. Net cash provided by operating activities was $7.8 billion in fiscal 2016 compared to $5.7 billion in fiscal 2015 and $3.9 billion in fiscal 2014.Net cash used for investing activities was $3.5 billion in fiscal 2016 compared to $4.3 billion in fiscal 2015 and $1.7 billion in fiscal 2014. The exercise of the AmerisourceBergen warrants used $2.4 billion of cash in the current year. The Alliance Boots acquisition used $4.5 billion of cash in the comparable prior year period. Other business acquisitions in fiscal 2016 were $126 million compared to $371 million in the comparable prior year period. Business acquisitions in the current period include the acquisition of an international beauty brand and prescription files. Other business acquisitions in the prior year period were primarily the purchase of prescription files.Additions to property, plant and equipment in fiscal 2016 were $1.3 billion compared to $1.3 billion in fiscal 2015 and $1.1 billion in fiscal 2014. Capital expenditures by reporting segment were as follows: ##TABLE_START   2016  2015  2014 Retail Pharmacy USA $  $  $1,106 Retail Pharmacy International (1)   444   249   - Pharmaceutical Wholesale (1)   104   51   - Total $1,325  $1,251  $1,106 ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START (1) Our Retail Pharmacy International and Pharmaceutical Wholesale segments were acquired as part of the Second Step Transaction in which we acquired the 55% of Alliance Boots that we did not already own on December 31, 2014. As a result of the timing of the acquisition, only eight months of capital expenditures (January through August 2015) have been reported for these divisions in fiscal 2015.##TABLE_END Our Retail Pharmacy USA segment opened, relocated or acquired 107 locations in fiscal 2016 compared to 133 locations in fiscal 2015 and 268 locations in fiscal 2014. Fiscal 2014 acquisitions included Kerr Drug, which contributed 76 drugstore locations as well as a specialty pharmacy and a distribution center. Significant Retail Pharmacy International capital expenditures primarily relate to investments in our stores and information technology projects. Pharmaceutical Wholesale capital expenditures primarily relate to investments in warehouses and operations and information technology projects.- 44 - Additionally, investing activities for fiscal 2016 included proceeds related to sale leaseback transactions of $60 million, compared to $867 million in the comparable prior year period, and the sale of a pharmaceutical wholesale operation for $43 million compared to the $814 million sale of Walgreen Infusion Services in the comparable prior year period.Net cash provided by financing activities in fiscal 2016 was $2.6 billion compared to net cash used for financing activities of $915 million in fiscal 2015 and $1.6 billion in fiscal 2014. In fiscal 2016, we received proceeds from public offerings of $6.0 billion of U.S. dollar denominated debt (described below). In fiscal 2015, we received proceeds from public offerings of $8.0 billion of U.S. dollar denominated debt, approximately $2.0 billion of Euro and Pound Sterling denominated debt and borrowed approximately $2.2 billion on a Pound Sterling denominated term loan which was used to refinance substantially all of Alliance Boots outstanding borrowings following the completion of the Second Step Transaction and pay related fees and expenses. We repurchased shares to support the needs of the employee stock plans totaling $1.0 billion in fiscal 2016 compared to $500 million in fiscal 2015 and $705 million in fiscal 2014. Proceeds related to employee stock plans were $235 million in fiscal 2016 compared to $503 million in fiscal 2015 and $612 million in fiscal 2014. Cash dividends paid were $1.6 billion in fiscal 2016 compared to $1.4 billion and $1.2 billion in fiscal 2015 and 2014, respectively. We currently intend to continue to maintain a long-term dividend payout ratio target of approximately 30 to 35 percent of adjusted net earnings attributable to Walgreens Boots Alliance.In August 2014, the Walgreens Board of Directors authorized the 2014 stock repurchase program (the 2014 stock repurchase program), which authorized the repurchase of up to $3.0 billion of Walgreens (or, after the Reorganization, Walgreens Boots Alliances) common stock prior to the programs expiration on August 31, 2016. We purchased 1.3 million shares under the 2014 stock repurchase program in fiscal 2016 at a total cost of $110 million, compared to 8.2 million shares purchased in fiscal 2015 at a total cost of $726 million. We determine the timing and amount of repurchases based on our assessment of various factors, including prevailing market conditions, alternate uses of capital, liquidity and the economic environment. As the consideration payable to Rite Aid stockholders will be paid in cash, we suspended activity under the 2014 stock repurchase program (other than share repurchases to offset dilution from our equity incentive plans  see Part II, Item 2 below) following our entry into the Merger Agreement. We have repurchased, and may from time to time in the future repurchase, shares on the open market through Rule 10b5-1 plans, which enable us to repurchase shares at times when we otherwise might be precluded from doing so under insider trading laws.The Company periodically borrows under its commercial paper program and may borrow under it in future periods. There were no commercial paper borrowings outstanding as of August 31, 2016 or 2015. The Company had weighted average daily short-term borrowings of $14 million of commercial paper outstanding at a weighted average interest rate of 0.66% in fiscal 2016. We had weighted average daily short-term borrowings of $82 million of commercial paper outstanding at a weighted average interest rate of 0.52% in fiscal 2015.On November 10, 2014, Walgreens Boots Alliance and Walgreens entered into a term loan credit agreement with the lenders party thereto (the Term Loan Agreement), which provided Walgreens Boots Alliance and Walgreens with the ability to borrow up to 1.45 billion on an unsecured basis. Borrowings under the Term Loan Agreement bear interest at a fluctuating rate per annum equal to the reserve adjusted LIBOR plus an applicable margin based on our credit ratings. As of August 31, 2016, we have borrowed 1.45 billion ($1.9 billion at the August 31, 2016 spot rate of $1.31 to 1) under the Term Loan Agreement. As of August 31, 2015, we had borrowed 1.45 billion ($2.2 billion at the August 31, 2015 spot rate of $1.54 to 1) under the Term Loan Agreement. On November 10, 2014, Walgreens Boots Alliance and Walgreens entered into a five-year unsecured, multicurrency revolving credit agreement with the lenders party thereto (the Revolving Credit Agreement), which has available credit of $3.0 billion, of which $500 million is available for the issuance of letters of credit. Borrowings under the Revolving Credit Agreement bear interest at a fluctuating rate per annum equal to, at our option, the alternate base rate or the reserve adjusted LIBOR, in each case, plus an applicable margin calculated based on our credit ratings. As of August 31, 2016, there were no borrowings or letters of credit issued pursuant to the Revolving Credit Agreement.Total upfront fees related to the Term Loan Agreement and Revolving Credit Agreement were $14 million. We pay a facility fee to the financing banks to keep these lines of credit active.Walgreens guaranteed the punctual payment when due, whether at stated maturity, by acceleration or otherwise, of all obligations of Walgreens Boots Alliance under the Term Loan Agreement and the Revolving Credit Agreement until August 10, 2015, when such guarantees were unconditionally released and discharged (as described below).On November 18, 2014, Walgreens Boots Alliance issued several series of unsecured, unsubordinated notes totaling $8.0 billion, with maturities ranging from 2016 to 2044. All such notes have fixed interest rates, with the exception of the $750 million notes due 2016, which were repaid in full in May 2016 and which had a floating rate based on the three month LIBOR plus a fixed spread of 45 basis points.- 45 - On November 20, 2014, Walgreens Boots Alliance issued series of unsecured, unsubordinated notes that included total Pound Sterling denominated debt of 700 million ($1.1 billion based on the November 20, 2014 exchange rate) with maturities due 2020 and 2025 and Euro denominated debt of 750 million ($940 million based on the November 20, 2014 exchange rate) due 2026. All notes issued on November 20, 2014 have fixed interest rates. The notes issued on November 18, 2014 and November 20, 2014 are collectively referred to as the 2014 WBA notes. The 2014 WBA notes were, upon initial issuance, fully and unconditionally guaranteed on an unsecured and unsubordinated basis by Walgreens.On December 19, 2014, Walgreens Boots Alliance and Walgreens entered into a Revolving Credit Agreement with the lenders party thereto (as amended, the 364-Day Credit Agreement). The 364-Day Credit Agreement was a $750 million, 364-day unsecured, multicurrency revolving facility. On July 9, 2015, the 364-Day Credit Agreement was amended to remove Walgreens as a borrower thereunder, eliminate Walgreens guarantee of all obligations of Walgreens Boots Alliance thereunder and make certain conforming changes to effectuate those modifications, including modifications and deletions of certain definitions and cross-references. On December 17, 2015, the Company terminated the 364-Day Credit Agreement. The 364-Day Credit Agreement remained undrawn as of the date of termination and would have matured on December 30, 2015.The 364-Day Credit Agreement and the Term Loan Agreement and Revolving Credit Agreement described above each contain or contained (as applicable) a covenant to maintain, as of the last day of each fiscal quarter, a ratio of consolidated debt to total capitalization not to exceed 0.60 to 1.00, as well as other customary restrictive covenants. As of August 31, 2016, we were in compliance with all such applicable covenants.On July 9, 2015, pursuant to an indenture, dated as of July 17, 2008, between Walgreens and Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as trustee, notices of redemption were given to (i) holders of 1.800% unsecured notes due 2017 (the 2017 Notes) and (ii) holders of 5.25% unsecured notes due 2019 (the 2019 Notes), in each case issued by Walgreens under the indenture. As a result, on August 10, 2015 (the redemption date), the 2017 Notes in the aggregate principal amount of $1.0 billion were redeemed in full and $750 million aggregate principal amount of the 2019 Notes were redeemed. The partial redemption of the 2019 Notes resulted in $250 million aggregate principal amount of 2019 Notes remaining outstanding. The redemption price with respect to the 2017 Notes was equal to 101.677% of the aggregate principal amount of such notes to be redeemed, plus accrued interest thereon to, but excluding, the redemption date. The redemption price with respect to the 2019 Notes was equal to 111.734% of the aggregate principal amount of such notes to be redeemed, plus accrued interest thereon to, but excluding, the redemption date.On August 10, 2015, upon the completion of the redemptions described above, the Walgreens guarantees of the 2014 WBA notes and the Term Loan Agreement and the Revolving Credit Agreement were unconditionally released and discharged in accordance with their terms. Pending Rite Aid Transaction. The cash consideration payable to Rite Aid stockholders pursuant to the Merger Agreement described under Introduction above is expected to be financed with a combination of cash on hand and debt financing. In connection with the Merger Agreement, Walgreens Boots Alliance entered into a bridge facility commitment letter (as amended and restated, the Commitment Letter) with UBS Securities LLC and UBS AG, Stamford Branch for a $12.8 billion senior unsecured bridge facility. On December 18, 2015, Walgreens Boots Alliance entered into a Bridge Term Loan Credit Agreement with the lenders party thereto (as amended, the Bridge Credit Agreement) and a Term Loan Credit Agreement with the lenders party thereto (as amended, the 2015 Term Loan Credit Agreement and, together with the Bridge Credit Agreement, the 2015 Credit Agreements). The Commitment Letter and the commitments contemplated thereby terminated upon Walgreens Boots Alliance entering into the 2015 Credit Agreements.The Bridge Credit Agreement is a 364-day unsecured bridge term loan facility and had initial aggregate commitments of $7.8 billion, which may be increased by Walgreens Boots Alliance prior to the funding of the loans thereunder by up to $2.0 billion in certain circumstances. As a result of the issuance of the notes and receipt of proceeds therefrom on June 1, 2016 and the entry into the term loan credit agreement on August 30, 2016, in each case, as described below, Walgreens Boots Alliance reduced its commitment under the Bridge Credit Agreement by approximately $6.0 billion and $1 billion, respectively, to approximately $0.8 billion. Walgreens Boots Alliance can extend up to $3.0 billion of the loans under the Bridge Credit Agreement for an additional 90-day period if desired. As of August 31, 2016, there were no borrowings under the Bridge Credit Agreement. The 2015 Term Loan Credit Agreement is a $5.0 billion unsecured term loan facility comprising two tranches with maturities three and five years following the funding date, or, if earlier, three and five years after October 27, 2016. The obligations of the lenders party to each of the Bridge Credit Agreement and the 2015 Term Loan Credit Agreement become effective upon the date of closing of the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement. As of August 31, 2016, there were no borrowings under the 2015 Term Loan Credit Agreement.- 46 - Walgreens Boots Alliance will be the borrower under each of the 2015 Credit Agreements. The ability of Walgreens Boots Alliance to request the making of loans under each of the 2015 Credit Agreements is subject to the satisfaction (or waiver) of certain conditions set forth therein and will terminate upon the occurrence of certain events set forth therein. Borrowings under each of the 2015 Credit Agreements will bear interest at a fluctuating rate per annum equal to, at Walgreens Boots Alliances option, the alternate base rate or the reserve adjusted Eurocurrency rate, in each case, plus an applicable margin calculated based on Walgreens Boots Alliances credit ratings. Upfront fees paid to date in connection with the 2015 Credit Agreements totaled $30 million. In addition, Walgreens Boots Alliance will also pay to the lenders under each of the 2015 Credit Agreements certain customary fees, including a ticking fee based on the aggregate outstanding commitments of the lenders under the applicable 2015 Credit Agreement starting at 90 days after signing.On June 1, 2016, Walgreens Boots Alliance issued in an underwritten public offering $1.2 billion of 1.750% notes due 2018 (the 2018 notes), $1.5 billion of 2.600% notes due 2021 (the 2021 notes), $0.8 billion of 3.100% notes due 2023 (the 2023 notes), $1.9 billion of 3.450% notes due 2026 (the 2026 notes) and $0.6 billion of 4.650% notes due 2046 (the 2046 notes). These notes are subject to redemption in certain circumstances. Walgreens Boots Alliance intends to use the net proceeds from the sale of the notes to fund a portion of the cash consideration payable in connection with the merger contemplated by the Merger Agreement, to retire a portion of Rite Aids existing debt and to pay related fees and expenses. Any remaining net proceeds from the sale of the notes may also be used for general corporate purposes. In the event that such merger is not consummated on or prior to June 1, 2017 (the first anniversary of the issuance date of the notes) or if the Merger Agreement is terminated at any time on or prior to June 1, 2017, then Walgreens Boots Alliance will be required to redeem in full the 2018 notes, the 2021 notes and the 2023 notes (but not the 2026 notes or 2046 notes, which will remain outstanding in accordance with their respective terms) on the date described in the applicable note at a redemption price equal to 101% of the aggregate principal amount of the notes to be redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the date of redemption. In addition, pursuant to the Merger Agreement, if the Merger Agreement is terminated by us or Rite Aid (i) due to the entry of a final order enjoining or prohibiting the merger by any antitrust authority, or (ii) following January 27, 2017 because required antitrust approvals have not been obtained or an antitrust authority has issued an injunction or order preventing the merger, we could be required to pay Rite Aid a termination fee of up to $650 million in certain circumstances.On August 30, 2016, Walgreens Boots Alliance entered into a $1.0 billion senior unsecured term loan facility with the lender party thereto (the 2016 Term Loan Credit Agreement) comprising two tranches with maturities on March 30, 2017 and one year after the funding date, respectively. The obligations of the lender under the 2016 Term Loan Credit Agreement become effective upon the date of closing of the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement. As of August 31, 2016, there were no borrowings under the 2016 Term Loan Credit Agreement.Each of the Companys 2015 Credit Agreements and the 2016 Term Loan Credit Agreement contain a covenant to maintain, as of the last day of each fiscal quarter, a ratio of consolidated debt to total capitalization not to exceed 0.60:1.00, as well as other customary restrictive covenants, such restrictive covenants shall not be in effect until the funding of the loans under the applicable credit agreement.As of October 19, 2016, the credit ratings of Walgreens Boots Alliance were:##TABLE_START Rating AgencyLong-Term Debt RatingCommercial Paper RatingOutlookFitchBBBF2StableMoodysBaa2P-2On review for downgradeStandard  PoorsBBBA-2Negative##TABLE_END - 47 - In assessing our credit strength, each rating agency consider various factors including our business model, capital structure, financial policies and financial performance. There can be no assurance that any particular rating will be assigned or maintained. Our credit ratings impact our borrowing costs, access to capital markets and operating lease costs. The rating agency ratings are not recommendations to buy, sell or hold our debt securities or commercial paper. Each rating may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating agency and should be evaluated independently of any other rating.Pursuant to our arrangements with AmerisourceBergen, we have the right, but not the obligation, to purchase a minority equity position in AmerisourceBergen over time as described under --AmerisourceBergen Corporation Relationship above. As of August 31, 2016, the Company owned 56,854,867 AmerisourceBergen common shares representing approximately 24% of the outstanding AmerisourceBergen common stock. This includes a total of approximately 11.5 million shares of AmerisourceBergen that we purchased in the open market. Share purchases may be made from time to time in open market transactions or pursuant to instruments and plans complying with Rule 10b5-1. Our ability to invest in equity in AmerisourceBergen above certain thresholds is subject to the receipt of regulatory approvals.On March 18, 2016, we exercised warrants to purchase 22,696,912 shares of AmerisourceBergen common stock at an exercise price of $51.50 per share for an aggregate exercise price payment of $1.17 billion. On August 25, 2016, we exercised additional warrants to purchase 22,696,912 shares of AmerisourceBergen common stock at an exercise price of $52.50 per share for an aggregate exercise price payment of $1.19 billion. The transactions were funded using existing cash on hand. See Note 5, Equity Method Investments, to the Consolidated Financial Statements included herein for further information.We believe that cash flow from operations, availability under our existing credit facilities and arrangements, current cash and investment balances and our ability to obtain other financing, if necessary, will provide adequate cash funds for our foreseeable working capital needs, capital expenditures at existing facilities, dividend payments and debt service obligations for at least the next 12 months. Our cash requirements are subject to change as business conditions warrant and opportunities arise. The timing and size of any new business ventures or acquisitions that we may complete may also impact our cash requirements.See Item 7A (Qualitative and Quantitative Disclosures about Market Risk) below for a discussion of certain financing and market risks.COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES The information set forth in Note 12 to our Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K is incorporated herein by reference.CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES The consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America and include amounts based on managements prudent judgments and estimates. Actual results may differ from these estimates. Management believes that any reasonable deviation from those judgments and estimates would not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations. To the extent that the estimates used differ from actual results, however, adjustments to the statement of earnings and corresponding balance sheet accounts would be necessary. These adjustments would be made in future periods. Some of the more significant estimates include business combinations, goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment, vendor allowances, liability for closed locations, cost of sales and inventory, equity method investments, pension and postretirement benefits and income taxes. We use the following methods to determine our estimates:Business Combinations  We account for business combinations using the acquisition method of accounting, which requires that once control is obtained, all the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, including amounts attributable to noncontrolling interests, be recorded at their respective fair values at the date of acquisition. The determination of fair values of assets and liabilities acquired requires estimates and the use of valuation techniques when market value is not readily available.For intangible assets, we generally use the income approach to determine fair value. The income approach requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions. These estimates and assumptions primarily include, but are not limited to: discount rates, terminal growth rates, royalty rates, forecasts of revenue, operating income, depreciation, amortization and capital expenditures. The discount rates applied to the projections reflect the risk factors associated with those projections.- 48 - Although we believe our estimates of fair value are reasonable, actual financial results could differ from those estimates due to the inherent uncertainty involved in making such estimates. Changes in assumptions concerning future financial results or other underlying assumptions could have a significant impact on the determination of the fair value of the intangible assets acquired.Judgment is also required in determining the intangible assets useful life.Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment  Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are evaluated for impairment annually during the fourth quarter, or more frequently if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value. As part of our impairment analysis for each reporting unit, we determine fair value for each reporting unit. This determination includes estimating the fair value using both the income and market approaches. The income approach requires management to estimate a number of factors for each reporting unit, including projected future operating results, economic projections, anticipated future cash flows and discount rates. The market approach estimates fair value using comparable marketplace fair value data from within a comparable industry grouping.The determination of the fair value of the reporting units and the allocation of that value to individual assets and liabilities within those reporting units requires us to make significant estimates and assumptions. These estimates and assumptions primarily include, but are not limited to: the selection of appropriate peer group companies, control premiums appropriate for acquisitions in the industries in which we compete, discount rates, terminal growth rates, forecasts of revenue, operating income, depreciation, amortization and capital expenditures. The allocation requires analysis to determine the fair value of assets and liabilities including purchased prescription files, customer relationships, pharmacy licenses and trade names. Although we believe our estimates of fair value are reasonable, actual financial results could differ from those estimates due to the inherent uncertainty involved in making such estimates. Changes in assumptions concerning future financial results or other underlying assumptions could have a significant impact on either the fair value of the reporting units, the amount of any goodwill impairment charge, or both.We also compared the sum of the estimated fair values of the reporting units to the Companys fair value as implied by the market value of the Companys equity and debt securities. This comparison indicated that, in total, our assumptions and estimates were reasonable. However, future declines in the overall market value of the Companys equity and debt securities may indicate that the fair value of one or more reporting units has declined below its carrying value.Our reporting units fair values exceeded their carrying amounts ranging from approximately 17 % to more than 116 %. See Note 8, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.Indefinite-lived intangible assets are tested by comparing the estimated fair value of the asset to its carrying value. If the carrying value of the asset exceeds its estimated fair value, an impairment loss is recognized and the asset is written down to its estimated fair value.Our indefinite-lived intangible asset fair value is estimated using the relief from royalty method and excess earnings method of the income approach. These estimates can be affected by a number of factors including, but not limited to, general economic conditions, availability of market information as well as our profitability.Vendor allowances  Vendor allowances are principally received as a result of purchases, sales or promotion of vendors products. Allowances are generally recorded as a reduction of inventory and are recognized as a reduction of cost of sales when the related merchandise is sold. Those allowances received for promoting vendors products are offset against advertising expense and result in a reduction of selling, general and administrative expenses to the extent of advertising incurred, with the excess treated as a reduction of inventory costs. Liability for closed locations  The liability is based on the present value of future rent obligations and other related costs (net of estimated sublease rent) to the first lease option date . - 49 - Cost of sales and inventory  Cost of sales includes the purchase price of goods and services sold, store and warehouse inventory loss, inventory obsolescence, manufacturing costs, certain direct product design and development costs and supplier rebates. In addition to product costs, cost of sales includes manufacturing costs, warehousing costs for retail operations, purchasing costs, freight costs, cash discounts and vendor allowances. Cost of sales for our Retail Pharmacy USA segment is derived based upon point-of-sale scanning information with an estimate for shrinkage and is adjusted based on periodic inventory counts. Inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market determined by the last-in, first-out (LIFO) method for the Retail Pharmacy USA segment and on a first-in first-out (FIFO) basis for inventory in the Retail Pharmacy International and Pharmaceutical Wholesale segments except for retail inventory in the Retail Pharmacy International segment, which is valued using the retail method. Equity method investments   We use the equity method to account for investments in companies if the investment provides the ability to exercise significant influence, but not control, over operating and financial policies of the investee. Our proportionate share of the net income or loss of these companies is included in consolidated net earnings. Judgment regarding the level of influence over each equity method investment includes considering key factors such as our ownership interest, representation on the board of directors, participation in policy-making decisions and material purchase and sale transactions. Pension and postretirement benefits  We have various defined benefit pension plans that cover some of our foreign employees. We also have postretirement healthcare plans that cover qualifying domestic employees. Eligibility and the level of benefits for these plans varies depending on participants status, date of hire and or length of service. Our pension and postretirement expenses and valuations are dependent on assumptions used by our actuaries in calculating those amounts. These assumptions include discount rates, healthcare cost trends, long-term rate of return on plan assets, retirement rates, mortality rates and other factors. In determining our long-term rate of return on plan assets assumption, we consider both the historical performance of the investment portfolio as well as the long-term market return expectations based on the investment mix of the portfolio. A change in any of these assumptions would have an effect on our projected benefit obligation and pension expense. A 25 basis point increase in the discount rate would result in a decline of $440 million to our pension benefit obligation. A 25 basis point decrease on the expected return on plan assets assumption would increase our pension expense by $24 million.Our policy is to fund our pension plans in accordance with applicable regulations. Our postretirement healthcare plans are not funded.Income taxes  We are subject to routine income tax audits that occur periodically in the normal course of business. U.S. federal, state, local and foreign tax authorities raise questions regarding our tax filing positions, including the timing and amount of deductions and the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions. In evaluating the tax benefits associated with our various tax filing positions, we record a tax benefit for uncertain tax positions using the highest cumulative tax benefit that is more likely than not to be realized. Adjustments are made to our liability for unrecognized tax benefits in the period in which we determine the issue is effectively settled with the tax authorities, the statute of limitations expires for the return containing the tax position or when more information becomes available. Our liability for unrecognized tax benefits, including accrued penalties and interest, is primarily included in other long-term liabilities and current income taxes on our Consolidated Balance Sheets and in income tax provision in our Consolidated St atements of Earnings. In determining our provision for income taxes, we use income, permanent differences between book and tax income, and enacted statutory income tax rates. The provision for income taxes rate also reflects our assessment of the ultimate outcome of tax audits in addition to any foreign-based income deemed to be taxable in the United States. Discrete events such as audit settlements or changes in tax laws are recognized in the period in which they occur.- 50 - CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS AND COMMITMENTS The following table lists our contractual obligations and commitments at August 31, 2016 (in millions):##TABLE_START   Payments Due by Period   Total  Less Than 1 Year  1-3 Years  3-5 Years  Over 5 Years Operating leases (1)  $34,089  $3,066  $5,798  $5,035  $20,190 Purchase obligations (2) :  3,108   2,922   176   10   - Open inventory purchase orders  2,077   2,077   -   -   - Real estate development  401   351   50   -   - Other corporate obligations  630   494   126   10   - Short-term borrowings and long-term debt *(3)   19,150   323   2,553   4,832   11,442 Interest payment on short term borrowings and long-term debt (3)   6,723   590   1,121   1,049   3,963 Insurance *   612   201   168   67   176 Retirement benefit obligations  1,180   73   127   103   877 Closed location obligations *   467   81   95   68   223 Capital lease obligations *(1)   1,270   68   122   114   966 Finance lease obligations  1,357   18   35   35   1,269 Other liabilities reflected on the balance sheet *(4)   1,121   147   292   193   489 Total $69,077  $7,489  $10,487  $11,506  $39,595 ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START * Recorded on balance sheet.##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START (1) Amounts for operating leases and capital leases do not include certain operating expenses under these leases such as common area maintenance, insurance and real estate taxes.

In addition, pursuant to the Merger Agreement, if the Merger Agreement is terminated by us or Rite Aid (i) due to the entry of a final order enjoining or prohibiting the merger by any antitrust authority, or (ii) following January 27, 2017 because required antitrust approvals have not been obtained or an antitrust authority has issued an injunction or order preventing the merger, we could be required to pay Rite Aid a termination fee of up to $650 million in certain circumstances. See Liquidity and Capital Resources above.##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START (4) Includes $302 million ($59 million in less than 1 year, $168 million in 1-3 years, $75 million in 3-5 years and none over 5 years) of unrecognized tax benefits recorded under Accounting Standards Codification Topic 740, Income Taxes.##TABLE_END The information in the foregoing table is presented as of August 31, 2016 and accordingly does not reflect obligations under agreements we entered into after that date.OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS We do not have any unconsolidated special purpose entities and, except as described herein, we do not have significant exposure to any off-balance sheet arrangements. The term off-balance sheet arrangement generally means any transaction, agreement or other contractual arrangement to which an entity unconsolidated with us is a party, under which we have: (i) any obligation arising under a guarantee contract, derivative instrument or variable interest; or (ii) a retained or contingent interest in assets transferred to such entity or similar arrangement that serves as credit, liquidity or market risk support for such assets.At August 31, 2016, we have issued $391 million in letters of credit, primarily related to insurance obligations.  We also had $60 million of guarantees outstanding at August 31, 2016. We remain secondarily liable on 79 leases. The maximum potential undiscounted future payments related to these leases was $340 million at August 31, 2016. - 51 - RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS See New Accounting Pronouncements within Note 2, Summary of Major Accounting Policies to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding recent accounting pronouncements.CAUTIONARY NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS This report and other documents that we file or furnish with the SEC contain forward-looking statements that are based on current expectations, estimates, forecasts and projections about our future performance, our business, our beliefs and our managements assumptions.

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosure about Market Risk Interest Rate RiskWe are exposed to interest rate volatility with regard to existing debt issuances. Primary exposures include LIBOR and commercial paper rates. From time to time, we use interest rate derivative contracts including interest rate caps, interest rate swaps and forward-starting interest rate swaps to hedge our exposure to the impact of interest rate changes on existing debt and future debt issuances respectively, to reduce the volatility of our financing costs and, based on current and projected market conditions, achieve a desired proportion of fixed versus floating-rate debt. Generally under these swaps, we agree with a counterparty to exchange the difference between fixed-rate and floating-rate interest amounts based on an agreed upon notional principal amount.Information regarding our transactions are set forth in Note 10, Financial Instruments to our Consolidated Financial Statements. These financial instruments are sensitive to changes in interest rates. On August 31, 2016, we had approximately $1.9 billion in long-term debt obligations that had floating interest rates. A one percentage point increase or decrease in interest rates on the various debt instruments we hold would increase or decrease the annual interest expense we recognize and the cash we pay for interest expense by approximately $19 million. The amounts exclude the impact of any associated derivative contracts.Foreign Currency Exchange Rate RiskWe are exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, primarily with respect to the British Pound Sterling and  Euro,  and certain other foreign currencies, including the Mexican Peso, Chilean Peso, Norwegian Krone and Turkish Lira which may affect our net investment in foreign subsid iaries and may cause fluctuations in cash flows related to foreign denominated transactions. We are also exposed to the translation of foreign currency earnings to the U.S. dollar. We enter into foreign currency forward contracts to hedge against the effect of exchange rate fluctuations on non-functional currency cash flows of certain entities denominated in foreign currencies. These transactions are almost exclusively less than 12 months in maturity. In addition, we enter into foreign currency forward contracts that are not designated in hedging relationships to offset, in part, the impacts of certain intercompany activities (primarily associated with intercompany financing transactions ) . As circumstances warrant, we also use basis swaps  as hedging instruments to hedge portions of our net investments in foreign operations. The foreign currency derivative instruments are sensitive to changes in exchange rates. A 1% increase or decrease in exchange rates would increase or decrease our pre-tax income by approximately $3 million due to changes in the value of foreign currency derivative instruments. Excluded from the computation were anticipated transactions, foreign currency trade payables and receivables, and net investments in foreign subsidiaries, which the abovementioned instruments are intended to partially hedge. Equity Price Risk Changes in AmerisourceBergen common stock price may have a significant impact on the fair value of the equity investment in AmerisourceBergen described in Note 5, Equity Method Investments to our Consolidated Financial Statements.

AND SUBSIDIARIESNOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS1. Organization Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. (Walgreens Boots Alliance) and its subsidiaries are a global pharmacy-led health and wellbeing enterprise. Its operations are conducted through three reportable segments (Retail Pharmacy USA, Retail Pharmacy International and Pharmaceutical Wholesale). See Note 18, Segment Reporting for further information.On December 31, 2014, Walgreens Boots Alliance became the successor of Walgreen Co. (Walgreens) pursuant to a merger designed to effect a reorganization of Walgreens into a holding company structure (the Reorganization). Pursuant to the Reorganization, Walgreens became a wholly-owned subsidiary of Walgreens Boots Alliance, a Delaware corporation formed for the purposes of the Reorganization, and each issued and outstanding share of Walgreens common stock converted on a one-to-one basis into Walgreens Boots Alliance common stock. References to the Company refer to Walgreens Boots Alliance and its subsidiaries from and after the effective time of the Reorganization on December 31, 2014 and, prior to that time, to the predecessor registrant Walgreens and its subsidiaries, except as otherwise indicated or the context otherwise requires.On December 31, 2014, following the completion of the Reorganization, Walgreens Boots Alliance completed the acquisition of the remaining 55% of Alliance Boots GmbH (Alliance Boots) that Walgreens did not previously own (the Second Step Transaction) in exchange for 3.133 billion in cash and approximately 144.3 million shares of Walgreens Boots Alliance common stock. Alliance Boots became a consolidated subsidiary and ceased being accounted for under the equity method immediately upon completion of the Second Step Transaction. For financial reporting and accounting purposes, Walgreens Boots Alliance was the acquirer of Alliance Boots. The consolidated financial statements (and other data) reflect the results of operations and financial position of Walgreens and its subsidiaries for periods prior to December 31, 2014 and of Walgreens Boots Alliance and its subsidiaries for periods from and after the effective time of the Reorganization on December 31, 2014.2. Summary of Major Accounting Policies Basis of PresentationThe consolidated financial statements include all subsidiaries in which the Company holds a controlling interest. Investments in less than majority-owned companies in which the Company does not have a controlling interest, but does have significant influence, are accounted for as equity method investments. All intercompany transactions have been eliminated.  The preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP) requires management to use judgment in the application of accounting policies, including making estimates and assumptions. The Company bases its estimates on the information available at the time, its experience and on various other assumptions believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Adjustments may be made in subsequent periods to reflect more current estimates and assumptions about matters that are inherently uncertain. Actual results may differ.Because of the acquisition of Alliance Boots, influence of certain holidays, seasonality, foreign currency rates, changes in vendor, payer and customer relationships and terms and other factors on the Companys operations, net earnings for any period may not be comparable to the same period in previous years. In addition, the positive impact on gross profit margins and gross profit dollars typically has been significant in the first several months after a generic version of a drug is first allowed to compete with the branded version, which is generally referred to as a generic conversion. In any given year, the number of major brand name drugs that undergo a conversion from branded to generic status can increase or decrease, which can have a significant impact on the Companys Retail Pharmacy USA segments sales, gross profit margins and gross profit dollars.To improve comparability, certain classification changes have been made to prior periods to conform to current year classifications. Cash and Cash EquivalentsCash and cash equivalents include cash on hand and all highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less. Credit and debit card receivables from banks, which generally settle within two to seven business days, of $114 million and $165 million were included in cash and cash equivalents at August 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.Restricted CashThe Company is required to maintain cash deposits with certain banks which consist of deposits restricted under contractual agency agreements and cash restricted by law and other obligations. As of August 31, 2016 and 2015, the amount of such restricted cash was $185 million, and $184 million respectively and is reported in Other current assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets .- 59 - Accounts ReceivableAccounts receivable are stated net of allowances for doubtful accounts. Accounts receivable balances primarily include amounts due from third party providers (e.g., pharmacy benefit managers, insurance companies and governmental agencies), clients and members, as well as vendors and manufacturers. Charges to bad debt are based on estimates of recoverability using both historical write-offs and specifically identified receivables. The allowance for doubtful accounts for fiscal 2016, 2015 and 2014 was $166 million, $172 million and $173 million, respectively. InventoryThe Company values inventories on a lower of cost or market basis. Inventory includes product costs, inbound freight, direct labor, warehousing costs, overhead costs relating to the manufacture and distribution of products and vendor allowances not classified as a reduction of advertising expense.The Companys Retail Pharmacy USA segment inventory is accounted for using the last-in-first-out (LIFO) method. At August 31, 2016 and 2015, Retail Pharmacy USA segment inventories would have been greater by $2.8 billion and $2.5 billion, respectively, if they had been valued on a lower of first-in-first-out (FIFO) cost or market basis. The total carrying value of the segment inventory accounted for under the LIFO method is $6.1 billion and $5.6 billion at August 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.The Companys Retail Pharmacy International and Pharmaceutical Wholesale segments inventory is accounted for using the FIFO method, except for retail inventory in the Retail Pharmacy International segment, which is primarily determined using the retail inventory method. Under the retail inventory method, cost is determined by applying a calculated cost-to-retail ratio across groupings of similar items. The cost-to-retail ratio is applied to ending inventory at its current owned retail valuation to determine the cost of ending inventory across groupings of similar items. Current owned retail valuation represents the retail price for which merchandise is offered for sale on a regular basis. Inherent in the retail method calculation are certain management judgments and estimates which can impact the owned retail valuation and, therefore, the ending inventory valuation at cost. The total carrying value of the inventory for Retail Pharmacy International and Pharmaceutical Wholesale segments is $2.9 billion and $3.1 billion at August 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.Equity Method InvestmentsThe Company uses the equity method to account for investments in companies if the investment provides the ability to exercise significant influence, but not control, over operating and financial policies of the investee. The Companys proportionate share of the net income or loss of these companies is included in consolidated net earnings. Judgment regarding the level of influence over each equity method investment includes considering key factors such as the Companys ownership interest, representation on the board of directors, participation in policy-making decisions and material intercompany transactions.See Note 5, Equity Method Investments for further information relating to the Companys equity method investments.InvestmentsThe Companys investments consist principally of corporate debt, other debt securities, and equity securities of publicly-traded companies.The Company classifies its investments in securities at the time of purchase as held-to-maturity or available-for-sale, and re-evaluates such classifications on a quarterly basis. Held-to-maturity investments consist of debt securities that the Company has the intent and ability to hold until maturity. These securities are recorded at cost, adjusted for the amortization of premiums and discounts, which approximates fair value. Available-for-sale debt and equity securities are recorded at fair value. Unrealized holding gains and losses on available-for-sale investments are excluded from earnings and are reported as a separate component of shareholders equity and comprehensive income until realized. Realized gains and losses of available-for-sale investments are included in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings.The Company evaluates these investments for other-than-temporary impairment. Such evaluation involves a variety of considerations, including assessments of the risks and uncertainties associated with general economic conditions and distinct conditions affecting specific issuers. Factors considered by the Company include (i) the length of time and the extent to which the fair value has been below cost; (ii) the financial condition, credit worthiness, and near-term prospects of the issuer; (iii) the length of time to maturity; (iv) future economic conditions and market forecasts; (v) the Companys intent and ability to retain its investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for recovery of market value; and (vi) an assessment of whether it is more likely than not that the Company will be required to sell its investment before recovery of fair value.- 60 - Property, Plant and EquipmentDepreciation is provided on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of owned assets. Estimated useful lives range from 20 years for land improvements, 3 to 50 for buildings and building improvements and 3 to 20 for fixtures, plant and equipment. Leasehold improvements, equipment under capital lease and capital lease properties are amortized over their respective estimate of useful life or over the term of the lease, whichever is shorter. Major repairs, which extend the useful life of an asset, are capitalized; routine maintenance and repairs are charged against earnings. The majority of the Companys fixtures and equipment uses the composite method of depreciation. Therefore, gains and losses on retirement or other disposition of such assets are included in earnings only when an operating location is closed, substantially remodeled or impaired. Property, plant and equipment consists of (in millions):##TABLE_START   2016  2015 Land and land improvements $3,738  $3,687 Buildings and building improvements  7,557   7,705 Fixtures and equipment  9,064   8,904 Capitalized system development costs and software  1,787   1,491 Capital lease properties  789   821    22,935   22,608 Less: accumulated depreciation and amortization  8,600   7,540 Balance at end of year $14,335  $15,068 ##TABLE_END Depreciation expense for property, plant and equipment was $1.3 billion in fiscal 2016, $1.3 billion in fiscal 2015 and $923 million in fiscal 2014.The Company capitalizes application stage development costs for significant internally developed software projects, such as upgrades to the store point-of-sale system. These costs are amortized over a three to eight year period. Amortization expense for capitalized system development costs and software was $238 million in fiscal 2016, $178 million in fiscal 2015 and $127 million in fiscal 2014. Unamortized costs at August 31, 2016 and 2015 were $0.9 billion and $1.0 billion, respectively.Business CombinationsBusiness combinations are accounted for under Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) Topic 805, Business Combinations, using the acquisition method of accounting. The cost of an acquired company is assigned to the tangible and intangible assets purchased and the liabilities assumed on the basis of their fair values at the date of acquisition. The determination of fair values of assets and liabilities acquired requires estimates and the use of valuation techniques when a market value is not readily available. Any excess of purchase price over the fair value of net tangible and intangible assets acquired is allocated to goodwill. The final determination of the fair value of certain assets and liabilities is completed within the one year measurement period as allowed under ASC Topic 805, Business Combinations. Transaction costs associated with business combinations are expensed as they are incurred.Goodwill and Other Intangible AssetsGoodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed. The Company accounts for goodwill and intangibles under ASC Topic 350, Intangibles  Goodwill and Other, which requires the Company to test goodwill and other indefinite-lived assets for impairment annually or whenever events or circumstances indicate that impairment may exist.Intangible assets are amortized on a straight line basis over their estimated useful lives. See Note 8, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets for additional disclosure regarding the Companys intangible assets.WarrantsThe warrants to acquire shares of AmerisourceBergen Corporation were accounted for as a derivative under ASC Topic 815, Derivatives and Hedging. The Company reports its warrants at fair value within other non-current assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets and changes in the fair value of warrants are recognized in other income in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings. A deferred credit from the day-one valuation attributable to the warrants granted to Walgreens was amortized over the life of the warrants. See Note 10, Financial Instruments, for additional disclosure regarding the Companys warrants.Financial InstrumentsThe Company uses derivative instruments to hedge its exposure to interest rate and currency risks arising from operating and financing activities. In accordance with its risk management policies, the Company does not hold or issue derivative instruments for trading or speculative purposes.- 61 - Derivatives are recognized on the Consolidated Balance Sheets at their fair values. When the Company becomes a party to a derivative instrument and intends to apply hedge accounting, it formally documents the hedge relationship and the risk management objective for undertaking the hedge which includes designating the instrument for financial reporting purposes as a fair value hedge, a cash flow hedge, or a net investment hedge. The accounting for changes in fair value of a derivative instrument depends on whether the Company had designated it in a qualifying hedging relationship and further, on the type of hedging relationship. The Company applies the following accounting policies:##TABLE_START  Changes in the fair value of a derivative designated as a fair value hedge, along with the gain or loss on the hedged asset or liability attributable to the hedged risk, are recorded in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings.##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  The effective portion of changes in the fair value of a derivative designated as a cash flow hedge is recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income and reclassified into earnings in the period or periods during which the hedged item affects earnings.##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  The effective portion of changes in the fair value of a derivative designated as a hedge of a net investment in a foreign operation is recorded in cumulative translation adjustments within accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income. Recognition in earnings of amounts previously recorded in cumulative translation adjustments is limited to circumstances such as complete or substantially complete liquidation of the net investment in the hedged investments in foreign operations.##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  Changes in the fair value of a derivative not designated in a hedging relationship are recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings along with the ineffective portions of changes in the fair value of derivatives designated in hedging relationships.##TABLE_END Cash receipts or payments on a settlement of a derivative contract are reported in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows consistent with the nature of the underlying hedged item.For derivative instruments designated as hedges, the Company assesses, both at the hedges inception and on an ongoing basis, whether the derivatives that are used in hedging transactions are highly effective in offsetting changes in fair values or cash flows of hedged items. Highly effective means that cumulative changes in the fair value of the derivative are between 80% and 125% of the cumulative changes in the fair value of the hedged item. In addition, when the Company determines that a derivative is not highly effective as a hedge, hedge accounting is discontinued. When it is probable that a hedged forecasted transaction will not occur, the Company discontinues hedge accounting for the affected portion of the forecasted transaction, and reclassifies any gains or losses in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) to earnings in the Consolidated Statement of Earnings. When a derivative in a hedge relationship is terminated or the hedged item is sold, extinguished or terminated, hedge accounting is discontinued prospectively.Impaired AssetsThe Company tests long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that a certain asset may be impaired. Once identified, the amount of the impairment is computed by comparing the carrying value of the assets to the fair value, which is based on the discounted estimated future cash flows. Impairment charges included in selling, general and administrative expenses were $305 million in fiscal 2016, primarily related to the Companys Cost Transformation Program (as defined below). Impairment charges recognized in fiscal 2015 and 2014 were $ 386 million and $ 167 million, respectively.Liabilities for Store ClosingsThe Company provides for future costs related to closed locations. The liability is based on the present value of future rent obligations and other related costs (net of estimated sublease rent) to the first lease option date. The reserve for store closings, including $ 91 million from locations closed under the Companys restructuring actions, was $466 million as of August 31, 2016 and $446 million as of August 31, 2015. See Note 4, Leases for additional disclosure regarding the Companys reserve for future costs related to closed locations.Pension and Postretirement BenefitsThe Company has various defined benefit pension plans that cover some of its foreign employees. The Company also has postretirement healthcare plans that cover qualifying domestic employees. Eligibility and the level of benefits for these plans vary depending participants status, date of hire and or length of service. Pension and postretirement expenses and valuations are dependent on assumptions used by third party actuaries in calculating those amounts. These assumptions include discount rates, healthcare cost trends, long-term return on plan assets, retirement rates, mortality rates and other factors. See Note 15, Retirement Benefits, for additional disclosure regarding the Companys pension and postretirement benefits.- 62 - The Company funds its pension plans in accordance with applicable regulations.Noncontrolling InterestsThe Company accounts for its less than 100% interest in consolidated subsidiaries in accordance with ASC Topic 810, Consolidation, and accordingly, the Company presents noncontrolling interests as a component of equity on its Consolidated Balance Sheets and reports the noncontrolling interest net earnings or loss as Net earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests in the Consolidated Statement of Earnings.CurrencyAssets and liabilities of non-U.S. dollar functional currency operations are translated into U.S. dollars at end-of-period exchange rates while revenues, expenses and cash flows are translated at average monthly exchange rates over the period. Equity is translated at historical exchange rates and the resulting cumulative translation adjustments are included as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.For U.S. dollar functional currency operations, foreign currency assets and liabilities are remeasured into U.S. dollars at end-of-period exchange rates, except for nonmonetary balance sheet amounts, which are remeasured from historical exchange rates. Revenues and expenses are recorded at average monthly exchange rates over the period, except for those expenses related to nonmonetary balance sheet amounts, which are remeasured from historical exchange rates. Gains or losses from foreign currency remeasurement and transactions are included in selling, general and administrative expenses within the Consolidated Statements of Earnings. For all periods presented, there were no material operational gains or losses from foreign currency transactions.Revenue RecognitionRevenue is recognized when: (i) persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, (ii) delivery has occurred or services have been rendered, (iii) the sellers price to the buyer is fixed or determinable, and (iv) collectability is reasonably assured. The following revenue recognition policies have been established for the Companys reportable segments.Retail Pharmacy USA and Retail Pharmacy InternationalThe Company recognizes revenue at the time the customer takes possession of the merchandise, after making appropriate adjustments for estimated returns. Revenue does not include sales related taxes. In certain international locations, the Company initially estimates revenue based on expected reimbursements from governmental agencies for dispensing prescription drugs and providing optical services. The estimates are based on historical experience and are updated to actual reimbursement amounts.Pharmaceutical WholesaleWholesale revenue is recognized upon shipment of goods, which is generally also the day of delivery. When the Company acts in the capacity of an agent or a logistics service provider, revenue is the fee received for the service and is recognized when the services have been performed. The Company has determined it is the agent when providing logistics services, which is based on its assessment of the following criteria: (i) whether it is the primary obligor in the arrangement, (ii) whether it has latitude in establishing the price, changing the product or performing part of the service, (iii) whether it has discretion in supplier selection, (iv) whether it is involved in the determination of service specifications, and (v) whether it is exposed to credit risk.Cost of SalesCost of sales includes the purchase price of goods and services sold, store and warehouse inventory loss, inventory obsolescence, manufacturing costs, certain direct product design and development costs and supplier rebates. In addition to product costs, cost of sales includes manufacturing costs, warehousing costs for retail operations, purchasing costs, freight costs, cash discounts and vendor allowances. Cost of sales for our Retail Pharmacy USA segment is derived based upon point-of-sale scanning information with an estimate for shrinkage and is adjusted based on periodic inventory counts.Vendor Allowances and Supplier RebatesVendor allowances are principally received as a result of purchases, sales or promotion of vendors products. Allowances are generally recorded as a reduction of inventory and are recognized as a reduction of cost of sales when the related merchandise is sold. Those allowances received for promoting vendors products are offset against advertising expense and result in a reduction of selling, general and administrative expenses to the extent of advertising costs incurred, with the excess treated as a reduction of inventory costs.Rebates or refunds received by the Company from its suppliers, mostly in cash, are considered as an adjustment of the prices of the suppliers products purchased by the Company.- 63 - Selling, General and Administrative Expense sSelling, general and administrative expenses mainly consist of salaries and employee costs, occupancy costs, depreciation and amortization, credit and debit card fees and expenses directly related to stores. In addition, other costs included are headquarters expenses, advertising costs (net of vendor advertising allowances), wholesale warehousing costs and insurance.Advertising CostsAdvertising costs, which are reduced by the portion funded by vendors, are expensed as incurred or when services have been received. Net advertising expenses, which are included in selling, general and administrative expenses, were $598 million in fiscal 2016, $491 million in fiscal 2015 and $265 million in fiscal 2014.Points Earned Through Loyalty ProgramsThe Companys primary rewards programs. Balance Rewards and Boots Advantage Card, are accrued as a charge to cost of sales at the time a point is earned. Points are funded internally and through vendor participation, and are credited to cost of sales at the time a vendor-sponsored point is earned. Breakage is recorded as points expire as a result of a members inactivity or if the points remain unredeemed after three years. Breakage income, which is reported in cost of sales, was not significant in fiscal 2016, 2015 or 2014. InsuranceThe Company obtains insurance coverage for catastrophic exposures as well as those risks required by law to be insured. In general, the Companys U.S. subsidiaries retain a significant portion of losses related to workers compensation, property, comprehensive general, pharmacist and vehicle liability, while non-U.S. subsidiaries manage their exposures through insurance coverage with third-party carriers. Management regularly reviews the probable outcome of claims and proceedings, the expenses expected to be incurred, the availability and limits of the insurance coverage, and the established accruals for liabilities. Liabilities for losses are recorded based upon the Companys estimates for both claims incurred and claims incurred but not reported and are not discounted. The provisions are estimated in part by considering historical claims experience, demographic factors and other actuarial assumptions.Stock Compensation PlansIn accordance with ASC Topic 718, Compensation  Stock Compensation, the Company recognizes compensation expense on a straight-line basis over the employees vesting period or to the employees retirement eligible date, if earlier. See Note 14, Stock Compensation Plans for more information on the Companys stock-based compensation plans.Income TaxesThe Company accounts for income taxes according to the asset and liability method. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized based upon the estimated future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured pursuant to tax laws using rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rate is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. Valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amounts more likely than not to be realized.In determining the provision for income taxes, the Company uses income, permanent differences between book and tax income, the relative proportion of foreign and domestic income, enacted statutory income tax rates, projections of income subject to Subpart F rules and unrecognized tax benefits related to current year results. Discrete events such as the assessment of the ultimate outcome of tax audits, audit settlements, recognizing previously unrecognized tax benefits due to lapsing of the applicable statute of limitations, recognizing or de-recognizing benefits of deferred tax assets due to future year financial statement projections and changes in tax laws are recognized in the period in which they occur.The Company is subject to routine income tax audits that occur periodically in the normal course of business. U.S. federal, state, local and foreign tax authorities raise questions regarding the Companys tax filing positions, including the timing and amount of deductions and the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions. In evaluating the tax benefits associated with the various tax filing positions, the Company records a tax benefit for uncertain tax positions using the highest cumulative tax benefit that is more likely than not to be realized. Adjustments are made to the liability for unrecognized tax benefits in the period in which the Company determines the issue is effectively settled with the tax authorities, the statute of limitations expires for the return containing the tax position or when more information becomes available.Earnings Per ShareThe dilutive effect of outstanding stock options on earnings per share is calculated using the treasury stock method. Stock options are anti-dilutive and excluded from the earnings per share calculation if the exercise price exceeds the average market price of the common shares. Outstanding options to purchase common shares that were anti-dilutive and excluded from earnings per share totaled 2.5 million, 2.5 million and 3.5 million in fiscal 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.- 64 - New Accounting PronouncementsIn August 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2016-15, Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments. This ASU addresses the classification of certain specific cash flow issues including debt prepayment or extinguishment costs, settlement of certain debt instruments, contingent consideration payments made after a business combination, proceeds from the settlement of certain insurance claims and distributions received from equity method investees. This ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017 (fiscal 2019), and interim periods within those fiscal years, with early adoption permitted. An entity that elects early adoption must adopt all of the amendments in the same period. The Company is currently evaluating the effect this ASU will have on our consolidated statement of cash flows.In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments  Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments. This ASU amends guidance on reporting credit losses for assets held at amortized cost basis and available for sale debt securities. This ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019 (fiscal 2021), including interim periods within those fiscal years, with early adoption permitted. The Company does not expect adoption will have a material impact on the Companys results of operations, cash flows or financial position.In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-09, Compensation  Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting. This ASU simplifies the employee share-based payment accounting of stock compensation, including the income tax consequences, classification of awards as either equity or liabilities, and classification on the statement of cash flows. Amendments requiring recognition of excess tax benefits and tax deficiencies in the income statement and the practical expedient for estimating expected term must be applied prospectively. Amendments related to the presentation of employee taxes paid on the statement of cash flows when an employer withholds shares to meet the minimum statutory withholding requirement must be applied retrospectively. An entity may elect to apply the amendments related to the presentation of excess tax benefits on the statement of cash flows using either a prospective transition method or a retrospective transition method. This ASU is effective for annual periods after December 15, 2016 (fiscal 2018), and interim periods within those fiscal years, with early adoption permitted. The Company is early adopting this guidance at the beginning of Fiscal 2017 and does not expect adoption will have a material impact on the Companys reults of operations, cash flows or financial position.In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-04, Liabilities  Extinguishments of Liabilities (Subtopic 405-20): Recognition of Breakage for Certain Prepaid Stored-Value Products. This ASU addresses diversity in practice related to the de-recognition of a prepaid store-value product liability. The ASU amends the guidance on extinguishing financial liabilities for certain prepaid store-value products. If an entity selling prepaid store-value products expects to be entitled to an amount that will not be redeemed, the entity will recognize the expected breakage in proportion to the pattern of rights expected to be exercised by the product holder to the extent that it is probable that a significant reversal of the breakage amount will not subsequently occur. The ASU is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017 (fiscal 2019), and interim periods within those fiscal years, with early adoption permitted, including adoption before the effective date of ASU 2015-14, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (described below). The amendments in this ASU should be applied either using a modified retrospective transition method by means of a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings as of the beginning of the fiscal year in which the guidance is effective or retrospectively to each period presented. The Company is currently evaluating the effect the ASU will have on its consolidated financial statements. In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842), which supersedes Topic 840, Leases. This ASU increases the transparency and comparability of organizations by recognizing lease assets and lease liabilities on the balance sheet and disclosing key information about leasing arrangements. At the lease commencement date, lessee recognizes a lease liability and right-of-use asset, which is initially measured at the present value of future lease payments. There are two approaches for amortizing the right-of use asset. Under the finance lease approach, interest on the lease liability is recognized separately from amortization of the right-of-use asset. Repayments of the principal portion of the lease liability will be classified as financing activities and payments of interest on the lease liability and variable lease payments will be classified as operating activities in the statement of cash flows. Under the operating lease approach, the cost of the lease is calculated on a straight-line basis over the life of the lease term. All cash payments are classified as operating activities in the statement of cash flows. For sale and leaseback transactions, in order for a sale to occur, the transfer of the asset must meet all criteria in Topic 606. If there is no sale for the seller-lessee, the buyer-lessor does not account for a purchase. Any consideration paid for the asset is accounted for as a financing transaction. For transactions previously accounted for as a sale and leaseback, the transition guidance in Topic 842 does not require an entity to assess whether the transaction would have qualified as a sale and a leaseback in accordance with Topic 842. Additionally, gains recorded under sale and leaseback transactions are recognized at the transaction date and no longer deferred over the lease term. This ASU is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2018 (fiscal 2020). In transition, lessees and lessors are required to recognize and measure leases at the beginning of the earliest period presented using a modified retrospective approach which includes a number of optional practical expedients that entities may elect to apply. The Company has begun evaluating and planning for the adoption and implementation of this ASU, including assessing the overall impact. This ASU will have a material impact on the Companys financial position. The impact on the Companys results of operations is being evaluated. The impact of this ASU is non-cash in nature and will not affect the Companys cash position.- 65 - In January 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-01, Financial Instruments  Overall (Subtopic 825-10). This ASU requires equity investments (except those under the equity method of accounting or those that result in the consolidation of an investee) to be measured at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in net income. However, an entity may choose to measure equity investments that do not have readily determinable fair values at cost minus impairment, if any, plus or minus changes resulting from observable price changes in orderly transactions for the identical or a similar investment of the same issuer. This simplifies the impairment assessment of equity investments previous held at cost. Separate presentation of financial assets and liabilities by measurement category is required. This ASU is effective prospectively for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017 (fiscal 2019). Early application is permitted, for fiscal years or interim periods that have not yet been issued as of the beginning of the fiscal year of adoption. The Company is evaluating the effect of adopting this new accounting guidance.In November 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-17, Income Taxes (Topic 740). This ASU simplifies the presentation of deferred income taxes by requiring that deferred tax assets and liabilities be classified as non-current in a classified statement of financial position. This ASU may be applied either prospectively to all deferred tax assets and liabilities, or retrospectively to all periods presented for annual periods beginning after December 16, 2016 and interim periods thereafter (fiscal 2018), with early adoption permitted, and may require additional disclosure based on the application method selected. The Company prospectively early adopted this ASU in the fourth quarter of 2016. The adoption did not result in a material reclassification in our statement of financial position. In August 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-14, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606), an update to ASU 2014-09. This ASU amends ASU 2014-09 to defer the effective date by one year for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017 (fiscal 2019). Subsequently, the FASB has also issued accounting standards updates which clarify the guidance. This ASU removes inconsistencies, complexities and allows transparency and comparability of revenue transactions across entities, industries, jurisdictions and capital markets by providing a single comprehensive principles-based model with additional disclosures regarding uncertainties. The principles-based revenue recognition model has a five-step analysis of transactions to determine when and how revenue is recognized. The core principle is that a company should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. Early adoption is permitted for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016 (fiscal 2018). In transition, the ASU may be applied retrospectively to each prior period presented or retrospectively with the cumulative effect recognized as of the date of adoption. The Company is evaluating the effect of adopting this new accounting guidance including the transition method.In July 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-11, Inventory (Topic 330). This ASU simplifies current accounting treatments by requiring entities to measure most inventories at the lower of cost and net realizable value rather than using lower of cost or market. This guidance does not apply to inventories measured using last-in, first-out method or the retail inventory method. This ASU is effective prospectively for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016 and interim periods thereafter (fiscal 2018) with early adoption permitted. Upon transition, entities must disclose the accounting change. The Company is evaluating the effect of adopting this new accounting guidance but does not expect adoption will have a material impact on the Companys results of operations, cash flows or financial position.3. Restructuring On April 8, 2015, the Walgreens Boots Alliance Board of Directors approved a plan to implement a new restructuring program (the Cost Transformation Program) as part of an initiative to reduce costs and increase operating efficiencies. The Cost Transformation Program implemented and built on the cost-reduction initiative previously announced by the Company on August 6, 2014 and included plans to close stores across the U.S.; reorganize corporate and field operations; drive operating efficiencies; and streamline information technology and other functions. The actions under the Cost Transformation Program focus primarily on the Retail Pharmacy USA segment, but includes activities from all segments and are expected to be substantially complete by the end of the Companys 2017 fiscal year. The Company estimates that it will recognize cumulative pre-tax charges to its GAAP financial results of between $1.3 billion and $1.5 billion, including costs associated with lease obligations and other real estate payments, asset impairments and employee termination and other business transition and exit costs. The Company incurred pre-tax charges of $424 million related to the Cost Transformation Program during fiscal 2016.  The Company incurred pre-tax charges of $542 million related to the Cost Transformation Program in fiscal 2015. From inception through August 31, 2016, the Company incurred pre-tax charges of $966 million ($448 million related to asset impairment charges, $293 million in real estate costs and $225 million in severance and other business transition and exit costs) related to the Cost Transformation Program. All charges related to the Cost Transformation Program have been recorded within selling, general and administrative expenses. Restructuring charges are recognized as the costs are incurred over time in accordance with GAAP.- 66 - In March 2014, the Walgreens Board of Directors approved a plan to close underperforming stores in efforts to optimize and focus resources within the Retail Pharmacy USA segment in a manner intended to increase stockholder value. As of August 31, 2015, this plan was completed and no additional charges related to the plan are expected. For fiscal 2015, the Company incurred pre-tax charges of $17 million, which were primarily related to lease termination costs. In fiscal 2014, the Company incurred pre-tax charges of $209 million. All charges related to this plan have been recorded within selling, general and administrative expenses. Restructuring costs by segment are as follows (in millions):##TABLE_START   Retail Pharmacy       Fiscal 2016 USA  International  Pharmaceutical Wholesale  Consolidated Asset impairments  215   10   -   225 Real estate costs  89   1   1   91 Severance and other business transition and exit costs  70   18   20   108 Total restructuring costs $  $  $  $                  Fiscal 2015                Asset impairments  216   7   -   223 Real estate costs  219   -   -   219 Severance and other business transition and exit costs  105   12   -   117 Total restructuring costs $  $  $-  $                  Fiscal 2014                Asset impairments  137   -   -   137 Real estate costs  71   -   -   71 Severance and other business transition and exit costs  1   -   -   1 Total restructuring costs $  $-  $-  $ ##TABLE_END 4. Leases Initial terms for leased premises in the U.S. are typically 15 to 25 years, followed by additional terms containing renewal options at five-year intervals, and may include rent escalation clauses. Non-U.S. leases are typically for shorter terms and may include cancellation clauses or renewal options. The commencement date of all lease terms is the earlier of the date the Company becomes legally obligated to make rent payments or the date the Company has the right to control the property. The Company recognizes rent expense on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease. In addition to minimum fixed rentals, some leases provide for contingent rentals based upon a portion of sales.The Company continuously evaluates its real estate portfolio in conjunction with its capital needs. The Company has entered into several sale-leaseback transactions. In fiscal 2016, 2015 and 2014, the Company recorded proceeds from sale-leaseback transactions of $60 million, $867 million and $67 million, respectively. In other transactions, the Company negotiated fixed rate renewal options which constitute a form of continuing involvement, resulting in the assets remaining on the balance sheet and a corresponding finance lease obligation.Annual minimum rental commitments under all leases having an initial or remaining non-cancelable term of more than one year are shown below (in millions):##TABLE_START   Financing Obligation  Capital Lease  Operating Lease 2017 $  $  $3,066 2018  18   62   2,972 2019  18   59   2,826 2020  18   58   2,632 2021  18   57   2,403 Later  1,267   966   20,190 Total Minimum Lease Payments $1,357  $1,270  $34,089 ##TABLE_END The capital and finance lease amounts include $1.7 billion of imputed interest and executory costs. Total minimum lease payments have not been reduced by minimum sublease rentals of $199 million on leases due in the future under non-cancelable subleases.The Company provides for future costs related to closed locations. The liability is based on the present value of future rent obligations and other related costs (net of estimated sublease rent) to the first lease option date. In fiscal 2016, 2015 and 2014, the Company recorded charges of $127 million, $252 million and $177 million, respectively, for facilities that were closed or relocated under long-term leases, including stores closed through the Companys store optimization plan and Cost Transformation Program. These charges are reported in selling, general and administrative expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings.- 67 - The changes in reserve for facility closings and related lease termination charges include the following (in millions):##TABLE_START   2016  2015 Balance at beginning of period $  $ Provision for present value of non-cancellable lease payments on closed facilities  134   231 Assumptions about future sublease income, terminations and changes in interest rates  (34)  (6)Interest accretion  27   27 Liability assumed through acquisition of Alliance Boots  -   13 Cash payments, net of sublease income  (107)  (76)Balance at end of period $  $ ##TABLE_END The Company remains secondarily liable on 79 leases. For leases on which the Company remains secondarily liable, the maximum potential undiscounted future payments are $340 million at August 31, 2016. Lease option dates vary, with some lease terms extending up to 2039.Rental expense, which includes common area maintenance, insurance and taxes, where appropriate, was as follows (in millions):##TABLE_START   2016  2015  2014 Minimum rentals $3,355  $3,176  $2,687 Contingent rentals  60   38   5 Less: Sublease rental income  (49)  (46)  (22)  $3,366  $3,168  $2,670 ##TABLE_END 5. Equity Method Investments Equity method investments as of August 31, 2016 and 2015 were as follows (in millions, except percentages):##TABLE_START   2016  2015   CarryingValue  OwnershipPercentage  CarryingValue  OwnershipPercentage AmerisourceBergen $4,964   24% $ NA   NA Others  1,210   12% - 50%  1,242   12% - 50%Total $6,174      $1,242     ##TABLE_END AmerisourceBergen InvestmentOn March 18, 2016, the Company exercised warrants to purchase 22,696,912 shares of AmerisourceBergen Corporation (AmerisourceBergen) common stock at an exercise price of $51.50 per share for an aggregate exercise price payment of $1.17 billion. On August 25, 2016, the Company exercised additional warrants to purchase 22,696,912 shares of AmerisourceBergen common stock at an exercise price of $52.50 per share for an aggregate exercise price payment of $1.19 billion. As of August 31, 2016, the Company owned 56,854,867 AmerisourceBergen common shares representing approximately 24% of the outstanding AmerisourceBergen common stock and accounts for its equity investment in AmerisourceBergen using the equity method of accounting, with the net earnings attributable to the Companys investment being classified within the operating income of its Pharmaceutical Wholesale segment. Due to the timing and availability of financial information of AmerisourceBergen, we account for this equity method investment on a financial reporting lag of two months. Due to the change in accounting method to equity method effective March 18, 2016 and the two-month reporting lag, the Companys results for fiscal 2016 include approximately three and a half months of equity method income. Equity earnings from AmerisourceBergen is reported as a separate line in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings. The level 1 fair market value of the Companys equity investment in AmerisourceBergen common stock at August 31, 2016 is $4.9 billion.The Companys investment in AmerisourceBergen carrying value exceeded its proportionate share of the net assets of AmerisourceBergen by $4.5 billion. This premium of $4.5 billion was recognized as part of the carrying value in the Companys equity investment in AmerisourceBergen. The difference was primarily related to goodwill and the fair value of AmerisourceBergen intangible assets. Other InvestmentsThe Companys other equity method investments include its investments in Guangzhou Pharmaceuticals Corporation and Nanjing Pharmaceutical Corporation Limited, the Companys pharmaceutical wholesale investments in China; and the equity method investment retained through the sale of a majority interest in Option Care Inc. in fiscal 2015. The Company reported $44 million and $24 million of post-tax equity earnings from equity method investments other than AmerisourceBergen and Alliance Boots for fiscal 2016 and 2015, respectively. Post-tax equity earnings from the historical Walgreens other equity method investments in fiscal 2014 were immaterial.- 68 - Also in fiscal 2015, the Company accounted for its 45% investment in Alliance Boots using the equity method of accounting. The Company utilized a three-month reporting lag in recording equity income in Alliance Boots, which was eliminated on December 31, 2014. The Companys share of Alliance Boots earnings was recorded as Equity earnings in Alliance Boots in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings. The Companys investment was recorded as Equity investment in Alliance Boots in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.Summarized Financial Information Summarized financial information for the Companys equity method investment in Alliance Boots is as follows:##TABLE_START Statements of Earnings (in millions)     Year Ended August 31,  2016 2015 (1)   2014 (l)  Net sales NA $13.071  $37.579 Gross Profit NA  3.050   8.096 Net Earnings NA  723   1.444 Share of earnings from equity method investments (1)  NA  315   617 ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START (l) Earnings in foreign equity method investments are translated at their respective average exchange rates.##TABLE_END 6.

In conjunction with the change to the equity method of accounting, the Company recognized a gain of $268 million of Other Comprehensive Income to Other income (expense) within the Consolidated Statements of Earnings. See Note 5, Equity Method Investments, and Note 10, Financial Instruments for further information.  In fiscal 2016, there were $7 million of available-for-sale securities sold. In fiscal 2015, subsequent to the Second Step Transaction, $52 million of acquired available-for-sale securities were sold. In 2014, there were no sales of available-for-sale investments. Gains and losses related to these disposals were not significant. The Company has $32 million and $36 million of available-for-sale investments classified within other current assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets at August 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. 7. Acquisitions Alliance BootsThe Second Step Transaction closed on December 31, 2014, resulting in the acquisition by the Company of 55% of the issued and outstanding share capital of Alliance Boots, increasing its interest to 100%. The Company previously accounted for its 45% interest in Alliance Boots as an equity method investment.As a result of the closing of the Second Step Transaction, the Company increased its ownership in WBAD, a global sourcing enterprise between Walgreens and Alliance Boots, to 100%. Because Walgreens held, prior to the Second Step Transaction, a 50% direct interest and an additional indirect interest in WBAD through its 45% ownership of Alliance Boots, the financial results of WBAD were fully consolidated into the Walgreens financial statements with the remaining 27.5% effective interest being recorded as a noncontrolling interest. The acquisition of the 27.5% noncontrolling interest was accounted for as an equity transaction with no gain or loss recorded in the statement of earnings under ASC Topic 805, Business Combinations. On January 1, 2015, WBAD Holdings Limited sold 320 common shares of WBAD, representing approximately 5% of the equity interests in WBAD, to Alliance Healthcare Italia Distribuzione S.p.A. (AHID), which is not a member of the Companys consolidated group. Under certain circumstances, AHID has the right to put, and WBAD Holdings Limited has the right to call, the 320 common shares of WBAD currently owned by AHID for a purchase price of $100,000.- 69 - The Company has completed the purchase accounting of the Second Step Transaction. The total purchase price of the Second Step Transaction of $15.9 billion included 3.133 billion in cash ($4.9 billion at the December 31, 2014 spot rate of $1.56 to 1.00) and 144.3 million of the Companys common shares at a fair value of $11.0 billion (based on the December 30, 2014 closing market price of $76.05). Of the total purchase price, $13.3 billion was allocated to acquire the 55% ownership interest in Alliance Boots and $2.6 billion was allocated to acquire the noncontrolling interest in WBAD. The purchase price attributed to the acquisition of the noncontrolling interest in WBAD was determined based on the relative fair value of Alliance Boots and WBAD, respectively.The impact of the equity transaction is as follows (in millions):##TABLE_START   Amount Consideration attributed to WBAD $2,559 Less: Carrying value of the Companys pre-existing noncontrolling interest  130 Impact to additional paid in capital $2,429 ##TABLE_END The following table summarizes the consideration paid to acquire the remaining 55% interest in Alliance Boots and the amounts of identified assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the date of the Second Step Transaction (in millions).##TABLE_START Consideration paid   Cash $4,874 Common stock  10,977 Total consideration transferred  15,851 Less: consideration attributed to WBAD  (2,559)   13,292 Fair value of the investment in Alliance Boots held before the Second Step Transaction  8,149 Total consideration $21,441 ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START Identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed including noncontrolling interests   Cash and cash equivalents $ Accounts receivable  3,799 Inventories  3,713 Other current assets  894 Property, plant and equipment  3,806 Intangible assets  11,691 Other non-current assets  2,217 Trade accounts payable, accrued expenses and other liabilities  (7,696)Borrowings  (9,010)Deferred income taxes  (2,452)Other non-current liabilities  (383)Noncontrolling interests  (412)Total identifiable net assets and noncontrolling interests  6,580 Goodwill $14,861 ##TABLE_END As a result of the Company acquiring the remaining 55% interest in Alliance Boots, the Companys previously held 45% interest was re-measured at fair value, resulting in a gain of $563 million. The gain has been recognized as Gain on previously held equity interest in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2015.The fair value of the previously held equity interest of $8.1 billion in Alliance Boots was determined using the income approach methodology. The fair value for trade names and trademarks was determined using the relief from royalty method of the income approach; pharmacy licenses and customer relationships were determined using the excess earnings method of the income approach; and loyalty card holders were determined using the incremental cash flow method, which is a form of the income approach. Personal property fair values were determined primarily using the indirect cost approach, while real property fair values were determined using the income, market and/or cost approach. The fair value measurements of the previously held equity interest and intangible assets are based on significant inputs not observable in the market, and thus represent Level 3 measurements. The fair value estimates for the previously held equity interest and intangible assets are based on (i) projected discounted cash flows, (ii) historical and projected financial information, (iii) synergies including cost savings, and (iv) attrition rates, as relevant, that market participants would consider when estimating fair values.- 70 - The identified definite and indefinite lived intangible assets were as follows:##TABLE_START Definite-Lived Intangible Assets Weighted-Average Useful Life (in years)  Amount (in millions) Customer relationships  12  $1,311 Loyalty card holders  20   742 Trade names and trademarks  9   399 Favorable lease interests  7   93 Total     $2,545 ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets Amount (in millions) Trade names and trademarks $6,657 Pharmacy licenses  2,489 Total $9,146 ##TABLE_END The goodwill of $14.9 billion arising from the Second Step Transaction primarily reflects the expected purchasing synergies, operating efficiencies by benchmarking performance and applying best practices across the Company, consolidation of operations, reductions in selling, general and administrative expenses and combining workforces.Following the completion of the Second Step Transaction, the Company realigned its operations into three reportable segments: Retail Pharmacy USA, Retail Pharmacy International and Pharmaceutical Wholesale. The Company determined that the goodwill should be allocated across all segments recognizing that each segment will benefit from the expected synergies.The goodwill allocated to the Retail Pharmacy USA segment of $7.3 billion is comprised of $3.5 billion of synergy benefits allocable to the segment on a source of procurement benefit basis and $3.8 billion determined on a with-and-without basis. The source of procurement benefit basis allocates the synergy benefits to the segment whose purchase gave rise to the benefit. The with-and-without basis computes the difference between the fair value of the pre-existing business before the combination and its fair value after the combination.Of the remaining goodwill, $3.9 billion was allocated to the Retail Pharmacy International segment and $3.7 billion was allocated to the Pharmaceutical Wholesale segment. Substantially all of the goodwill recognized is not expected to be deductible for income tax purposes.The Company incurred legal and other professional services costs related to the Second Step Transaction, which were included in selling, general and administrative expenses, of $87 million in fiscal 2015.The fair value of the assets acquired includes inventory having an estimated fair value of $3.7 billion. This fair value includes a $106 million fair value adjustment to capitalize the estimated profit in acquired finished goods inventory as of the date of the Second Step Transaction, which was expensed to cost of sales over the first inventory turn.The following table presents supplemental unaudited condensed pro forma consolidated information for 2015 and 2014 as if the Second Step Transaction had occurred on September 1, 2013, the first day of the Companys fiscal 2014. The unaudited condensed pro forma information reflect certain adjustments related to past operating performance and acquisition accounting adjustments, such as increased amortization expense based on the fair valuation of assets acquired, the impact of acquisition financing, transaction costs and the related income tax effects.

These acquisitions included an international beauty brand and prescription files resulting in an increase of $23 million to goodwill and $95 million to intangible assets. The remaining fair value relates to immaterial amounts of tangible assets, less liabilities assumed and contingent considerations. Operating results of the businesses acquired have been included in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings from their respective acquisition dates forward. Pro forma results of the Company, assuming all of the other acquisitions had occurred at the beginning of each period presented, would not be materially different from the results reported.The aggregate purchase price of all businesses acquired in fiscal 2015, excluding Alliance Boots, net of cash received was $371 million for fiscal 2015. In fiscal 2015, the Company acquired Liz Earle Beauty Co. Ltd, owner of the Liz Earle skincare brand in addition to other asset acquisitions, primarily pharmacy prescription files. These acquisitions resulted in an increase of $126 million to goodwill and $255 million to intangible assets. Any remaining fair value relates to immaterial amounts of tangible assets, less liabilities assumed. Operating results of the businesses acquired have been included in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings from their respective acquisition dates forward. Pro forma results of the Company, assuming all of the other acquisitions had occurred at the beginning of each period presented, would not be materially different from the results reported. Additionally, in fiscal 2015 the Company completed the sale of a majority interest in its subsidiary, Walgreens Infusion Services to Madison Dearborn Partners (MDP). Walgreens Infusion Services became a new independent, privately-held company named Option Care Inc.  8. Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets Goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets are evaluated for impairment annually during the fourth quarter, or more frequently if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value. As part of the Companys impairment analysis, we determined fair value for each reporting unit using both the income and market approaches. The income approach requires management to estimate a number of factors for each reporting unit, including projected future operating results, economic projections, anticipated future cash flows and discount rates. The market approach estimates fair value using comparable marketplace fair value data from within a comparable industry grouping. Based on the results of our testing, the fair values of each of the reporting units and other indefinite-lived intangible assets exceeded their carrying values, therefore, no impairment was recognized.The determination of the fair value of the reporting units and the allocation of that value to individual assets and liabilities within those reporting units requires the Company to make significant estimates and assumptions. These estimates and assumptions primarily include but are not limited to; the selection of appropriate peer g roup companies; control premiums appropriate for acquisitions in the industries in which the Company competes; the discount rate; terminal growth rates; and forecasts of revenue, operating income, depreciation and amortization and capital expenditures. The allocation requires analyses to determine the fair value of assets and liabilities including, among other things, trade names and trademarks, pharmacy licenses, customer relationships and purchased prescription files. Although the Company believes its estimates of fair value are reasonable, actual financial results could differ from those estimates due to the inherent uncertainty involved in making such estimates. Changes in assumptions concerning future financial results or other underlying assumptions could have a significant impact on either the fair value of the reporting units, the amount of the goodwill impairment charge, or both. - 72 - Changes in the carrying amount of goodwill by reportable segment consist of the following activity (in millions):##TABLE_START   Retail Pharmacy USA  Retail Pharmacy International  Pharmaceutical Wholesale  Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc.

Financial Instruments The Company uses derivative instruments to manage its exposure to interest rate and foreign currency exchange risks.The notional amounts, fair value and balance sheet presentation of derivative instruments outstanding as of August 31, 2016 and 2015 were as follows (in millions): ##TABLE_START 2016 Notional (1)   Fair Value Location in Consolidated Balance SheetsDerivatives designated as fair value hedges :       Interest rate swaps $  $ Other non-current assetsDerivatives not designated as hedges :         Foreign currency forwards  1,177   16 Other current assetsForeign currency forwards  41   - Other current liabilitiesBasis swap  2   1 Other current liabilities##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  (1) Amounts are presented in U.S. dollar equivalents, as applicable.##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START 2015 Notional (1)   Fair Value Location in Consolidated Balance SheetsDerivatives designated as fair value hedges :       Interest rate swaps $  $ Other non-current assetsDerivatives designated as cash flow hedges :         Foreign Currency Forwards  1,205   34 Other current assetsForeign Currency Forwards  495   9 Other current liabilitiesBasis Swap  1   - Other current assets##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  (1) Amounts are presented in U.S. dollar equivalents, as applicable.##TABLE_END The Company uses interest rate swaps to manage the interest rate exposure associated with some of its fixed-rate borrowings and designates them as fair value hedges.The Company utilizes foreign currency forward contracts and other foreign currency derivatives to hedge significant committed and highly probable future transactions and cash flows denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the Company or its subsidiaries. The Company has significant non-US dollar denominated net investments and uses foreign currency denominated financial instruments, specifically foreign currency derivatives and foreign currency denominated debt, to hedge its foreign currency risk.Fair Value HedgesIn fiscal 2015, the Company entered into a series of interest rate swaps, converting $750 million of its 5.250% fixed rate notes to a floating interest rate based on the six-month LIBOR in arrears plus a constant spread and an interest rate swap converting $250 million of its 5.250% fixed rate notes to a floating interest rate based on the one-month LIBOR in arrears plus a constant spread. All swap termination dates coincide with the notes maturity date, January 15, 2019. These swaps were designated as fair value hedges. On August 10, 2015, the Company terminated $500 million of the six-month LIBOR in arrears swaps and all of the one-month LIBOR in arrears swaps in connection with the repayment of the associated debt.- 77 - The gains and losses due to changes in fair value on the swaps and on the hedged notes attributable to interest rate risk and did not have a material impact on the Companys financial statements.The changes in fair value of the Companys debt that was swapped from fixed to variable rate and designated as fair value hedges are included in short-term and long-term debt on the Consolidated Balance Sheets (see Note 9, Borrowings). At August 31, 2016 and 2015, the cumulative fair value adjustments resulted in an increase in long-term debt of $2 million and $ 1 million, respectively. No material gains or losses were recorded from ineffectiveness during fiscal 2016, 2015 or 2014. Derivatives not Designated as HedgesThe Company enters into derivative transactions that are not designated as accounting hedges. These derivative instruments are economic hedges of interest rate and foreign currency risks. Income or expense due to changes in fair value of these derivative instruments were recognized in earnings as follows (in millions):##TABLE_START Location in ConsolidatedStatements of Earnings 2016  2015  2014 Interest rate swapsInterest expense, net $-  $  $- Foreign currency forwardsSelling, general and administrative expense  19   78   - Second Step Transaction foreign currency forwardsOther income (expense)  -   (166)  - Foreign currency forwardsOther income (expense)  (12)  72   - ##TABLE_END WarrantsOn March 18, 2016, the Company exercised warrants to purchase 22,696,912 shares of AmerisourceBergen common stock at an exercise price of $51.50 per share for an aggregate exercise price payment of $1.17 billion.

Fair Value Measurements The Company measures certain assets and liabilities in accordance with ASC Topic 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures, which defines fair value as the price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. In addition, it establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes observable and unobservable inputs used to measure fair value into three broad levels:- 78 - ##TABLE_START Level 1 - Quoted prices in active markets that are accessible at the measurement date for identical assets and liabilities. The fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to Level 1 inputs.##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START Level 2 - Observable inputs other than quoted prices in active markets.##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START Level 3 - Unobservable inputs for which there is little or no market data available. The fair value hierarchy gives the lowest priority to Level 3 inputs.##TABLE_END Assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis were as follows (in millions):##TABLE_START   August 31, 2016  Level 1  Level 2  Level 3 Assets :            Restricted cash (1)  $  $  $-  $- Money market funds (2)   9,133   9,133   -   - Available-for-sale investments (3)   32   32   -   - Interest rate swaps (4)   3   -   3   - Foreign currency forwards (5)   16   -   16   - Liabilities :                Basis swaps (5)   1   -   1   - ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START   August 31, 2015  Level 1  Level 2  Level 3 Assets :            Restricted cash (1)  $  $  $-  $- Money market funds (2)   2,043   2,043   -   - Available-for-sale investments (3)   1,183   1,183   -   - Interest rate swaps (4)   2   -   2   - Foreign currency forwards (5)   34   -   34   - Warrants (6)   2,140   -   2,140   - Liabilities :                Foreign currency forwards (5)   9   -   9   - ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START (1) Restricted cash consists of deposits restricted under agency agreements and cash restricted by law and other obligations.##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START (2) Money market funds are valued at the closing price reported by the fund sponsor.##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START (3) Fair values of quoted investments are based on current bid prices as of the balance sheet dates.

Key assumptions used in the valuation include risk-free interest rates using constant maturity treasury rates; the dividend yield for AmerisourceBergens common stock; AmerisourceBergens common stock price at the valuation date; AmerisourceBergens equity volatility; the number of shares of AmerisourceBergens common stock outstanding; the number of AmerisourceBergen employee stock options and the exercise price; and the details specific to the warrants.##TABLE_END There were no transfers between levels in fiscal 2016 or 2015.The Company reports its debt instruments under the guidance of ASC Topic 825, Financial Instruments, which requires disclosure of the fair value of the Companys debt in the footnotes to the consolidated financial statements. Unless otherwise noted, the fair value for all notes was determined based upon quoted market prices and therefore categorized as Level 1. See Note 9, Borrowings for further details. The carrying values of accounts receivable and trade accounts payable approximated their respective fair values due to their short-term nature.- 79 - 12. Commitments and Contingencies The Company is involved in legal proceedings and is subject to investigations, inspections, audits, inquiries and similar actions by governmental authorities, arising in the normal course of the Companys business, including the matters described below. Legal proceedings, in general, and securities and class action litigation, in particular, can be expensive and disruptive. Some of these suits may purport or may be determined to be class actions and/or involve parties seeking large and/or indeterminate amounts, including punitive or exemplary damages, and may remain unresolved for several years. From time to time, the Company is also involved in legal proceedings as a plaintiff involving antitrust, tax, contract, intellectual property and other matters. Gain contingencies, if any, are recognized when they are realized. The results of legal proceedings are often uncertain and difficult to predict, and the costs incurred in litigation can be substantial, regardless of the outcome. The Company believes that its defenses and assertions in pending legal proceedings have merit, and does not believe that any of these pending matters, after consideration of applicable reserves and rights to indemnification, will have a material adverse effect on the Companys consolidated financial position. However, substantial unanticipated verdicts, fines and rulings do sometimes occur. As a result, the Company could from time to time incur judgments, enter into settlements or revise its expectations regarding the outcome of certain matters, and such developments could have a material adverse effect on its results of operations in the period in which the amounts are accrued and/or its cash flows in the period in which the amounts are paid.On a quarterly basis, the Company assesses its liabilities and contingencies for outstanding legal proceedings and reserves are established on a case-by-case basis for those legal claims for which management concludes that it is probable that a loss will be incurred and that the amount of such loss can be reasonably estimated. Substantially all of these contingencies are subject to significant uncertainties and, therefore, determining the likelihood of a loss and/or the measurement of any loss can be complex. With respect to litigation and other legal proceedings where the Company has determined that a loss is reasonably possible, the Company is unable to estimate the amount or range of reasonably possible loss in excess of amounts reserved due to the inherent difficulty of predicting the outcome of and uncertainties regarding such litigation and legal proceedings. The Companys assessments are based on estimates and assumptions that have been deemed reasonable by management, but that may prove to be incomplete or inaccurate, and unanticipated events and circumstances may occur that might cause the Company to change those estimates and assumptions. Therefore, it is possible that an unfavorable resolution of one or more pending litigation or other contingencies could have a material adverse effect on the Companys consolidated financial statements in a future fiscal period. Managements assessment of current litigation and other legal proceedings, including the corresponding accruals, could change because of the discovery of facts with respect to legal actions or other proceedings pending against the Company which are not presently known. Adverse rulings or determinations by judges, juries, governmental authorities or other parties could also result in changes to managements assessment of current liabilities and contingencies. Accordingly, the ultimate costs of resolving these claims may be substantially higher or lower than the amounts reserved.On December 5 and 12, 2014, putative shareholders filed class actions in federal court in the Northern District of Illinois against the Walgreens Board of Directors, Walgreen Co., and Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. arising out of the Companys definitive proxy statement/prospectus filed with the SEC in connection with the special meeting of Walgreens shareholders on December 29, 2014. The actions asserted claims that the definitive proxy statement/prospectus was false or misleading in various respects. On December 23, 2014, solely to avoid the costs, risks and uncertainties inherent in litigation, and without admitting any liability or wrongdoing, Walgreens entered into a memorandum of understanding with the plaintiffs in both actions, pursuant to which Walgreens made certain supplemental disclosures. The proposed settlement was subject to, among other things, court approval. On July 8, 2015, the Court preliminarily approved the settlement, and on November 20, 2015, the Court entered an order of final approval of the settlement. On December 17, 2015, a purported class member who had objected to the settlement appealed the Courts order. The appeal was docketed with the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit. Oral argument was held on June 2, 2016. On August 10, 2016, the Seventh Circuit issued an order reversing the district courts judgment approving the settlement and remanding the case for further proceedings.On December 29, 2014, a putative shareholder filed a derivative action in federal court in the Northern District of Illinois against certain current and former directors and officers of Walgreen Co., and Walgreen Co. as a nominal defendant, arising out of certain public statements the Company made regarding its former fiscal 2016 goals. The action asserts claims for breach of fiduciary duty, waste and unjust enrichment. On April 10, 2015, the defendants filed a motion to dismiss. On May 18, 2015, the case was stayed in light of the securities class action that was filed on April 10, 2015, which is described below.On April 10, 2015, a putative shareholder filed a securities class action in federal court in the Northern District of Illinois against Walgreen Co. and certain former officers of Walgreen Co. The action asserts claims for violation of the federal securities laws arising out of certain public statements the Company made regarding its former fiscal 2016 goals. On June 16, 2015, the Court entered an order appointing a lead plaintiff. Pursuant to the Courts order, lead plaintiff filed an amended complaint on August 17, 2015, and defendants moved to dismiss the amended complaint on October 16, 2015. Lead plaintiff filed a response to the motion to dismiss on December 22, 2015, and defendants filed a reply in support of the motion on February 5, 2016. On September 30, 2016, the Court issued an order granting in part and denying in part Walgreen Co.s motion to dismiss.- 80 - As of August 31, 2016, the Company was aware of ten putative class action lawsuits (the Rite Aid actions) filed by purported Rite Aid stockholders against Rite Aid and its board of directors, Walgreens Boots Alliance and Victoria Merger Sub, Inc. for claims arising out of the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement (the Rite Aid Transactions). Eight of the Rite Aid actions were filed in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware (the Delaware actions), one Rite Aid action was filed in the State of Pennsylvania in the Court of Common Pleas of Cumberland County (the Pennsylvania action), and one Rite Aid action was filed in the United States District Court for the Middle District of Pennsylvania (the federal action). The Delaware actions and the Pennsylvania action primarily allege that the Rite Aid board of directors breached its fiduciary duties in connection with the Rite Aid Transactions by, among other things, agreeing to an unfair and inadequate price, agreeing to deal protection devices that preclude other bidders from making successful competing offers for Rite Aid, and failing to disclose all allegedly material information concerning the proposed merger; and also allege that Walgreens Boots Alliance and Victoria Merger Sub, Inc. aided and abetted these alleged breaches of fiduciary duty. The federal action alleges, among other things, that Rite Aid and its board of directors disseminated an allegedly false and misleading proxy statement in connection with the Rite Aid Transactions. The Delaware actions were consolidated, and plaintiffs filed a motion for expedited proceedings and a motion for preliminary injunction seeking to enjoin the Rite Aid shareholder vote on the Rite Aid Transactions. The plaintiffs in the federal action also filed a motion for preliminary injunction seeking to enjoin the same Rite Aid shareholder vote. All such motions were denied, and the Rite Aid shareholders approved the Rite Aid Transactions at a special meeting on February 4, 2016. On April 15, 2016, the plaintiffs in the Delaware actions agreed to a settlement in principle related to this matter for an immaterial amount. In the Pennsylvania action, plaintiffs agreed to stay the litigation until after the Rite Aid Transactions have closed. 13.

The fair value of the amended option resulted in a financial statement loss of $866 million. The loss on the Alliance Boots call option was, in part, a capital loss and available to be carried forward and offset future capital gains through fiscal 2020. In 2015, the deferred tax asset related to the loss was recognized, resulting in the 4.1% effective tax rate benefit reported in the table above.##TABLE_END The deferred tax assets and liabilities included in the Consolidated Balance Sheets consist of the following (in millions):##TABLE_START   2016  2015 Deferred tax assets      Postretirement benefits $  $ Compensation and benefits  205   224 Insurance  75   68 Accrued rent  169   167 Outside basis difference  134   73 Bad debts  65   67 Tax attributes  373   341 Stock compensation  97   119 Deferred income  150   - Other  195   93    1,653   1,282 Less: Valuation allowance  305   125 Total deferred tax assets  1,348   1,157 Deferred tax liabilities        Accelerated depreciation  1,205   1,234 Inventory  388   420 Intangible assets  1,418   1,822 Equity method investment  978   333 Deferred income  -   889    3,989   4,698 Net deferred tax liabilities $2,641  $3,541 ##TABLE_END At August 31, 2016, the Company has recorded deferred tax assets of $373 million, primarily reflecting the benefit of $200 million in U.S. federal, $226 million in state and $837 million in non-U.S. ordinary and capital losses. In addition, these deferred tax assets include $55 million of income tax credits. Of these deferred tax assets, $139 million will expire at various dates from 2017 through 2036. The residual deferred tax assets of $234 million have no expiry date.The Company believes it is more likely than not that the benefit from certain deferred tax assets will not be realized. In recognition of this risk, the Company has recorded a valuation allowance of $305 million against those deferred tax assets as of August 31, 2016.Income taxes paid were $1.1 billion, $1.3 billion and $1.2 billion for fiscal years 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.ASC Topic 740, Income Taxes, provides guidance regarding the recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure in the financial statement of tax positions taken or expected to be taken on a tax return, including the decision whether to file in a particular jurisdiction. As of August 31, 2016, unrecognized tax benefits of $252 million were reported as long-term liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets while $51 million were reported as current tax liabilities. Both of these amounts include interest and penalties, when applicable.- 82 - The following table provides a reconciliation of the total amounts of unrecognized tax benefits (in millions):##TABLE_START   2016  2015  2014 Balance at beginning of year $  $  $ Gross increases related to business combination  -   84   - Gross increases related to tax positions in a prior period  21   45   55 Gross decreases related to tax positions in a prior period  (47)  (75)  (82)Gross increases related to tax positions in the current period  68   63   46 Settlements with taxing authorities  (17)  (45)  (22)Currency  (11)  -   - Lapse of statute of limitations  (6)  (4)  (12)Balance at end of year $  $  $ ##TABLE_END At August 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, $237 million, $227 million and $105 million, respectively, of unrecognized tax benefits would favorably impact the effective tax rate if recognized. During the next twelve months, based on current knowledge, it is reasonably possible the amount of unrecognized tax benefits could decrease by up to $51 million due to anticipated tax audit settlements and the expirations of statutes of limitations associated with tax positions related to multiple tax jurisdictions.The Company recognizes interest and penalties in the income tax provision in its Consolidated Statements of Earnings. At August 31, 2016, and August 31, 2015, the Company had accrued interest and penalties of $34 million and $36 million, respectively. For the year ended August 31, 2016, the amount reported in income tax expense related to interest and penalties was $2 million. The Company files a consolidated U.S. federal income tax return as well as income tax returns in various states and multiple foreign jurisdictions. It is generally no longer under audit examination for U.S. federal income tax purposes for any years prior to fiscal 2015. With few exceptions, it is no longer subject to state and local income tax examinations by tax authorities for years before fiscal 2007. In foreign tax jurisdictions, the Company is generally no longer subject to examination by the tax authorities in Luxembourg prior to 2011 , in Germany prior to 2011, in France prior to 2011 , and in Turkey prior to 2011 . With respect to the United Kingdom, a number of specific issues remain open to examination by the tax authorities back to 2000. The Company has received tax holidays from Swiss cantonal income taxes relative to certain of its Swiss operations. The income tax holidays are expected to extend through September 2022. The holidays had a beneficial impact of $116 million and $89 million during fiscal 2016 and 2015, respectively. This benefit is primarily included as part of the foreign income taxed at non-U.S. rates line in the effective tax rate reconciliation table above.At August 31, 2016, it is not practicable for the Company to determine the amount of the unrecognized deferred tax liability it has with respect to temporary differences related to investments in foreign subsidiaries and foreign corporate joint ventures that are essentially permanent in duration.14. Stock Compensation Plans The Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. Omnibus Incentive Plan (the Omnibus Plan) which became effective in fiscal 2013, provides for incentive compensation to the Companys non-employee directors, officers and employees, and consolidates into a single plan several previously existing equity compensation plans.The Company grants stock options, performance shares and restricted units under the Omnibus Plan. Performance shares issued under the Omnibus Plan offer performance-based incentive awards and equity-based awards to key employees. The fair value of each performance share granted assumes that performance goals will be achieved at 100 percent. If such goals are not met, no compensation expense is recognized and any recognized compensation expense is reversed. Restricted stock units are also equity-based awards with performance requirements that are granted to key employees. The performance shares and restricted stock unit awards are both subject to restrictions as to continuous employment except in the case of death, normal retirement or total and permanent disability. Total stock-based compensation expense for fiscal 2016, 2015 and 2014 was $115 million, $109 million and $114 million, respectively. The recognized tax benefit was $21 million, $7 million and $31 million for fiscal 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Unrecognized compensation cost related to non-vested awards at August 31, 2016, was $111 million. This cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted average of three years.- 83 - 15. Retirement Benefits The Company sponsors several retirement plans, including defined benefit plans, defined contribution plans and a postretirement health plan. Pursuant to the Second Step Transaction, the Company assumed a number of retirement benefit plans in the United Kingdom and other countries. The Company valued the assumed pension assets and liabilities on the acquisition date and uses an August 31 annual measurement date for its pension and post-retirement plans.Effective September 1, 2016, for UK and U.S. benefit plans using the yield curve approach, the Company will change the method used to calculate the service cost and interest cost components of net periodic benefit costs for pension and postretirement benefit plans and will measure these costs by applying the specific spot rates along the yield curve to the plans projected cash flows. The Company believes the new approach will provide a more precise measurement of service and interest costs by improving the correlation between projected cash flows and the corresponding spot yield curve rates. The change does not affect the measurement of the Companys pension and other postretirement benefit obligations for those plans and will be accounted for as a change in accounting estimate, which is applied prospectively. This change is not expected to have a material impact to the 2017 full year results.Defined Benefit Pension Plans (non-U.S. plans)The principal defined benefit pension plan is the Boots Pension Plan covering certain employees in the United Kingdom (the Boots Plan). The Boots Plan is a funded final salary defined benefit plan providing pensions and death benefits to members. The Boots Plan was closed to future accrual effective July 1, 2010 with pensions calculated based on salaries up until that date. The Boots Plan is governed by a trustee board, which is independent of the Company. The plan is subject to a full funding actuarial valuation on a triennial basis. The Company also has two smaller defined benefit plans in the United Kingdom, both of which were closed to future accruals effective July 1, 2010. Defined benefit pension plan assets were invested in the following classes of securities as of August 31:##TABLE_START Percentage of Fair Market Value 2016  2015 Equity securities  8.9%  9.5%Debt securities  78.8%  81.5%Real estate  4.3%  5.6%Other  8.0%  3.4%##TABLE_END  The investment strategy of the principal defined benefit pension plan is to hold approximately 85% of its assets in a diverse portfolio of high quality bonds with the remainder invested in equity and real estate assets backing longer term liabilities. Interest rate and inflation rate swaps are also employed to complement the role of fixed and index-linked bond holdings in liability risk management.The following table presents defined benefit pension plan assets using the fair value hierarchy as of August 31, 2016 (in millions). ##TABLE_START   August 31, 2016  Level 1  Level 2  Level 3 Equity securities :            Equity securities (1)  $  $-  $  $-                  Debt securities:                Fixed interest government bonds (2)   265   -   265   - Index linked government bonds (2)   3,502   -   3,502   - Corporate bonds (3)   3,663   -   3,663   -                  Real estate:            Real estate (4)   411   -   -   411                  Other :                Other investments (5)   753   38   713   2                  Total $9,428  $  $8,977  $ ##TABLE_END - 84 - ##TABLE_START   August 31, 2015  Level 1  Level 2  Level 3 Equity securities :            Equity securities (1)  $  $-  $  $-                  Debt securities:                Fixed interest government bonds (2)   267   -   267   - Index linked government bonds (2)   1,006   -   1,006   - Corporate bonds (3)   5,535   -   5,535   - Other bonds (6)   472   -   472   -                  Real estate:                Real estate (4)   502   -   -   502                  Other :                Other investments (5)   302   25   275   2                  Total $8,936  $  $8,407  $ ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START (1) Equity securities, which mainly comprise investments in comingled funds, are valued based on quoted prices and are primarily exchange-traded.

The Companys contribution, which has historically related to adjusted FIFO earnings before interest and taxes and a portion of which is in the form of a guaranteed match, is determined annually at the discretion of the Board of Directors. The profit-sharing provision was an expense of $226 million, $ 158 million and $355 million in fiscal 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. The Companys contributions were $225 million, $249 million and $328 million in fiscal 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. The Company also has certain contract based defined contribution arrangements. The principal one is the Alliance Healthcare  Boots Retirement Savings Plan, which is United Kingdom based and to which both the Company and participating employees contribute. The cost related to these arrangements recognized in the Consolidated Statement of Earnings for fiscal 2016 was $130 million and from the date of the Second Step Transaction through August 31, 2015 was $93 million. Postretirement Healthcare PlanThe Company provides certain health insurance benefits to retired U.S. employees who meet eligibility requirements, including age, years of service and date of hire. The costs of these benefits are accrued over the service life of the employee. The Companys postretirement health benefit plan obligation was $466 and $ 431 million in fiscal 2016 and 2015 respectively and is not funded. The expected benefit to be paid net of the estimated federal subsidy during fiscal year 2017 is $11 million.- 87 - 16. Capital Stock In connection with the Companys capital policy, the Board of Directors has authorized share repurchase programs. In August 2014, the Companys Board of Directors authorized the 2014 stock repurchase program which authorized the repurchase of up to $3.0 billion of the Companys common stock prior to its expiration on August 31, 2016. The Company purchased 1.3 million and 8.2 million shares under the 2014 stock repurchase program in fiscal 2016 and 2015 at a cost of $110 million and $726 million, respectively.The Company determines the timing and amount of repurchases based on its assessment of various factors including prevailing market conditions, alternate uses of capital, liquidity, the economic environment and other factors. The timing and amount of these purchases may change at any time and from time to time. The Company has repurchased, and may from time to time in the future repurchase, shares on the open market through Rule 10b5-1 plans, which enable a company to repurchase shares at times when it otherwise might be precluded from doing so under insider trading laws.In addition, the Company continued to repurchase shares to support the needs of the employee stock plans. Shares totaling $1.0 billion were purchased to support the needs of the employee stock plans during fiscal 2016 as compared to $500 million and $705 million in fiscal 2015 and fiscal 2014, respectively. At August 31, 2016, 43.8 million shares of common stock were reserved for future issuances under the Companys various employee benefit plans.17.

Segment Reporting Prior to December 31, 2014, the Companys operations were within one reportable segment. As a result of the closing of the Second Step Transaction on December 31, 2014, the Company has realigned its operations into three reportable segments: Retail Pharmacy USA, Retail Pharmacy International and Pharmaceutical Wholesale. The operating segments have been identified based on the financial data utilized by the Companys Chief Executive Officer (the chief operating decision maker) to assess segment performance and allocate resources among the Companys operating segments, which have been aggregated as described below. The chief operating decision maker uses adjusted operating income to assess segment profitability. The chief operating decision maker does not use total assets by segment to make decisions regarding resources, therefore the total asset disclosure by segment has not been included.##TABLE_START  The Retail Pharmacy USA segment consists of the legacy Walgreens business, which includes the operation of retail drugstores and convenient care clinics and the provision of specialty pharmacy services. Revenues for the segment are principally derived from the sale of prescription drugs and a wide assortment of general merchandise, including non-prescription drugs, beauty products, photo finishing, seasonal merchandise, greeting cards and convenience foods.##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  The Retail Pharmacy International segment consists primarily of the legacy Alliance Boots pharmacy-led health and beauty stores, optical practices, and related contract manufacturing operations. Stores are located in the United Kingdom, Mexico, Chile, Thailand, Norway, the Republic of Ireland, The Netherlands and Lithuania. Revenues for the segment are principally derived from the sale of prescription drugs and retail health, beauty, toiletries and other consumer products.##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  The Pharmaceutical Wholesale segment consists of the legacy Alliance Boots pharmaceutical wholesaling and distribution businesses and an equity method investment in AmerisourceBergen reported on a two-month lag. Wholesale operations are located in France, the United Kingdom, Germany, Turkey, Spain, The Netherlands, Egypt, Norway, Romania, Czech Republic and Lithuania. Revenues for the segment are principally derived from wholesaling and distribution of a comprehensive offering of brand-name pharmaceuticals (including specialty pharmaceutical products) and generic pharmaceuticals, health and beauty products, home healthcare supplies and equipment, and related services to pharmacies and other healthcare providers.##TABLE_END The results of operations for each reportable segment include synergy benefits, including WBAD operations and an allocation of corporate-related overhead costs. The Eliminations column contains items not allocable to the reportable segments, as the information is not utilized by the chief operating decision maker to assess segment performance and allocate resources.The segment information reflects the operating results of the Companys business segments. The Company began recording revenue and expense transactions using the new segments effective January 1, 2015. Beginning January 1, 2015, synergy benefits including WBAD operations have been allocated to the Retail Pharmacy USA, Retail Pharmacy International and Pharmaceutical Wholesale segments on a source of procurement benefit basis. Under this method, the synergy benefits are allocated to the segment whose purchase gave rise to the benefit. A synergy arising on the purchase of an item for use in an entity in the Retail Pharmacy USA segment is recognized in the Retail Pharmacy USA segment and similarly for the Retail Pharmacy International and Pharmaceutical Wholesale segments. Procurement service income related to third parties is recognized in the Pharmaceutical Wholesale segment. Corporate costs have been allocated to segments based on their respective gross profit.The Companys Retail Pharmacy International and Pharmaceutical Wholesale segments were acquired as part of the Second Step Transaction in which the Company acquired the 55% of Alliance Boots that it did not already own on December 31, 2014. The Company has determined that it is impracticable to restate segment information for periods prior the completion of the Second Step Transaction, as well as to provide disclosures for such periods under both the old basis and new basis of reporting for certain items. Specifically, WBAD operations prior to December 31, 2014 were recorded in the Retail Pharmacy USA segment and have not been restated, as the Company believes it is impracticable to separate the information to the individual reportable segments. Equity earnings from Alliance Boots prior to the completion of the Second Step Transaction has been recorded within the Retail Pharmacy USA segment. The equity earnings of the 45% interest in Alliance Boots have not been separated into the Retail Pharmacy International and Pharmaceutical Wholesale segments for the prior period, as the Company believes it is impracticable. Accordingly, only eight months of results (January to August 2015) have been reported for these segments for fiscal 2015. To improve comparability, certain classification changes have been made to prior period results , this change has no impact on operating income.- 89 - The following table reflects results of operations of the Companys reportable segments (in millions):##TABLE_START   Retail Pharmacy            USA  International (1)   Pharmaceutical Wholesale  Eliminations (1)   Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc.

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Walgreens Boots Alliance,  Inc. (successor to Walgreen  Co.) and subsidiaries (the Company) as of August  31, 2016 and 2015, and the related consolidated statements of earnings, comprehensive income, equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended August  31, 2016. These financial statements are the responsibility of the Companys management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits. We did not audit the consolidated income statement of Alliance Boots GmbH (Alliance Boots ) for the year ended May 31, 2014, which the Company utilized for its accounting of its investment in Alliance Boots using the equity method (see note 5 to the consolidated financial statements ), for the year ended August 31, 2014. The accompanying 2014 consolidated financial statements of the Company include its equity earnings in Alliance Boots of $617  million for the year ended August  31, 2014. The respective consolidated income statement of Alliance Boots was prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board, was audited by other auditors whose report has been furnished to us, and our opinion, insofar as it relates to the amounts included for the Companys equity earnings in Alliance Boots, on the basis of International Financial Reporting Standards as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board, is based on the report of the other auditors. We have applied auditing procedures to the adjustments to reflect the Companys equity earnings in Alliance Boots in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America and auditing procedures to take into consideration the differences in reporting periods between Alliance Boots and the Company. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits and the report of the other auditors provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.In our opinion, based on our audits and the report of the other auditors, such consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Walgreens Boots Alliance,  Inc. and subsidiaries as of August  31, 2016 and 2015, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended August  31, 2016, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the Companys internal control over financial reporting as of August  31, 2016, based on the criteria established in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated October  20 , 2016 expressed an unqualified opinion on the Companys internal control over financial reporting based on our audit./s/ DELOITTE  TOUCHE LLPChicago, IllinoisOctober  20 , 2016- 95 - REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRMTo the Board of Directors and Shareholders Walgreens Boots Alliance, IncWe have audited the internal control over financial reporting of Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. (successor to Walgreen Co.) and subsidiaries (the Company) as of August 31, 2016 based on criteria established in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. The Companys management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Managements Report on Internal Control. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Companys internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.A companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the companys principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, and effected by the companys board of directors, management, and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.Because of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting, including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Also, projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of August 31, 2016 , based on the criteria established in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended August 31, 2016 of the Company and our report dated October 20 , 2016 expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements./s/ DELOITTE  TOUCHE LLPChicago, IllinoisOctober 20 , 2016 - 96 - REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRMThe Board of DirectorsAlliance Boots GmbH:We have audited the non-statutory consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, changes in equity, and cash flows of Alliance Boots GmbH and subsidiaries (the Group) for the year ended May 31, 2014, not presented separately herein.

Report on Internal Control Over Financial ReportingManagements report on internal control over financial reporting and the report of Deloitte  Touche LLP, the Companys independent registered public accounting firm, related to their assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting are included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K and are incorporated in this Item 9A by reference.Changes in Internal Control over Financial ReportingIn connection with the evaluation pursuant to Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(d) of the Companys internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f)) by the C ompanys management, including its CEO and CFO, no changes during the quarter ended August 31, 2016 were identified that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Companys internal control over financial reporting.- 98 - Inherent Limitations on Effectiveness of ControlsOur management, including the CEO and CFO, do not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent or detect all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the control systems objectives will be met. The design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Further, because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that misstatements due to error or fraud will not occur or that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the Company have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake. Controls can also be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people, or by management override of the controls. The design of any system of controls is based in part on certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. Projections of any evaluation of controls effectiveness to future periods are subject to risks. Over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or deterioration in the degree of compliance with policies or procedures.", "9B": " Item 9B.

Walgreens Boots Alliance was incorporated in Delaware in 2014 and, as described below, is the successor of Walgreen Co., an Illinois corporation, which was formed in 1909 as a successor to a business founded in 1901. Our principal executive offices are located at 108 Wilmot Road, Deerfield, Illinois 60015. Our common stock trades on the NASDAQ Stock Market under the symbol WBA.  1 As of August 31, 2017 , using publicly available information for AmerisourceBergen. 2 For 12 months ending August 31, 2017 , using publicly available information for AmerisourceBergen. - 1 - Recent transactions On March 31, 2017, Walgreens Boots Alliance and pharmacy benefit manager Prime Therapeutics LLC closed a transaction to form a combined central specialty pharmacy and mail services company, AllianceRx Walgreens Prime, as part of a strategic alliance. AllianceRx Walgreens Prime is consolidated by Walgreens Boots Alliance and reported within the Retail Pharmacy USA division in its financial statements. See note 6, acquisitions to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information. On March 18, 2016, we exercised warrants to purchase 22,696,912 shares of AmerisourceBergen Corporation (AmerisourceBergen) common stock at an exercise price of $51.50 per share for an aggregate exercise price payment of $1.17 billion. On August 25, 2016, we exercised additional warrants to purchase 22,696,912 shares of AmerisourceBergen common stock at an exercise price of $52.50 per share for an aggregate exercise price payment of $1.19 billion. Following the August 25, 2016 warrant exercise, we do not hold any further warrants to purchase shares of AmerisourceBergen common stock. As of August 31, 2017 and 2016 , we owned 56,854,867 AmerisourceBergen common shares, representing approximately 26% and 24% of the outstanding AmerisourceBergen common stock, respectively, and had designated one member of AmerisourceBergens board of directors. As of August 31, 2017 , we can acquire up to an additional 8,398,752 AmerisourceBergen shares in the open market and thereafter designate a second member of AmerisourceBergens board of directors, subject in each case to applicable legal and contractual requirements. The amount of permitted open market purchases is subject to increase or decrease in certain circumstances. The warrants were issued in March 2013 pursuant to a Framework Agreement between Walgreens, Alliance Boots GmbH (Alliance Boots) and AmerisourceBergen. Concurrently, Walgreens, Alliance Boots and AmerisourceBergen announced various other agreements and arrangements, including a ten-year pharmaceutical distribution agreement between Walgreens and AmerisourceBergen pursuant to which we source branded and generic pharmaceutical products from AmerisourceBergen in the U.S. and an agreement which provides AmerisourceBergen the ability to access generics pharmaceutical products through our global sourcing enterprise. In May 2016, certain agreements were extended for three years to now expire in 2026. Effective March 18, 2016, we began accounting for our investment in AmerisourceBergen using the equity method of accounting, subject to a two-month reporting lag, with the net earnings attributable to our investment being classified within the operating income of our Pharmaceutical Wholesale segment. See note 5, equity method investments to the Consolidated Financial Statements included herein for further information. Due to the March 18, 2016 effective date and the two-month reporting lag, our results for the 12 month period ended August 31, 2016 include approximately three and a half months of equity method income relating to our investment in AmerisourceBergen. Similarly, our results for the 12 month period ended August 31, 2017 include approximately ten and a half months of equity income reflecting our increased ownership following the exercise on August 25, 2016 of the second tranche of warrants.  On December 31, 2014, Walgreens Boots Alliance became the successor of Walgreens pursuant to a merger to effect a reorganization of Walgreens into a holding company structure, with Walgreens Boots Alliance becoming the parent holding company. Pursuant to the Reorganization, Walgreens became a wholly owned subsidiary of Walgreens Boots Alliance, which was formed for the purposes of the Reorganization, and each issued and outstanding share of Walgreens common stock converted on a one-to-one basis into Walgreens Boots Alliance common stock. Also on December 31, 2014, following the completion of the Reorganization, Walgreens Boots Alliance completed the acquisition of the remaining 55% of Alliance Boots that Walgreens did not previously own (the Second Step Transaction) in exchange for 3.133 billion in cash and 144.3 million shares of Walgreens Boots Alliance common stock. Alliance Boots became a consolidated subsidiary and ceased being accounted for under the equity method immediately upon completion of the Second Step Transaction. For financial reporting and accounting purposes, Walgreens Boots Alliance was the acquirer of Alliance Boots. The Consolidated Financial Statements (and other data, such as prescriptions filled) reflect the results of operations and financial position of Walgreens and its subsidiaries for periods prior to December 31, 2014 and of Walgreens Boots Alliance and its subsidiaries for periods from and after the effective time of the Reorganization on December 31, 2014.  In addition, we have completed a number of additional acquisitions, divestitures and strategic initiatives in recent years designed to grow our businesses and enhance our competitive position. Please refer to managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in part II, item 7 below and note 3, exit and disposal activities, note 5, equity method investments and note 6, acquisitions to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in part II, item 8 below for additional information. Rite Aid transaction Terminated acquisition of Rite Aid Corporation (Rite Aid) and related matters On October 27, 2015, Walgreens Boots Alliance entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger with Rite Aid and Victoria Merger Sub, Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of Walgreens Boots Alliance (as amended as described below, the Merger - 2 - Agreement), pursuant to which the Company agreed, subject to the terms and conditions thereof, to acquire Rite Aid, a drugstore chain in the United States. The Merger Agreement was amended by Amendment No. 1 thereto on January 29, 2017. In connection with regulatory review of the merger contemplated by the Merger Agreement, on December 20, 2016, Walgreens Boots Alliance and Rite Aid announced that they had entered into an agreement (the Freds Asset Purchase Agreement), subject to the terms and conditions thereof, to sell certain Rite Aid stores and certain assets related to store operations to Freds, Inc. (Freds) for $950 million in an all-cash transaction. The transaction was subject to the approval and completion of the acquisition of Rite Aid by Walgreens Boots Alliance pursuant to the Merger Agreement. On June 28, 2017, Walgreens Boots Alliance and Rite Aid entered into a mutual termination agreement (the Termination Agreement) pursuant to which the parties agreed to terminate the Merger Agreement, including all schedules and exhibits thereto, and all ancillary agreements contemplated thereby, or entered pursuant thereto (other than as expressly specified) (collectively with the Merger Agreement, the Transaction Documents), effective as of June 28, 2017. Pursuant to the Termination Agreement, the Company paid Rite Aid the termination fee of $325 million, in full satisfaction of any amounts required to be paid by the Company under the Merger Agreement and other Transaction Documents. The parties also agreed to release each other from, among other things, any and all liability, claims, rights, actions, causes of action, damages, expenses and fees, however arising, in connection with, arising out of or related to the Transaction Documents, the transactions contemplated therein or thereby or certain related matters. On June 28, 2017, following the termination of the Merger Agreement, the Freds Asset Purchase Agreement was terminated. In connection with the termination of the Freds Asset Purchase Agreement, the Company reimbursed $25 million of Freds transaction costs in full satisfaction of any amounts required to be paid by the Company under the Freds Asset Purchase Agreement. See note 8, borrowings to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information relating to the termination of the Merger Agreement and related matters. Acquisition of certain Rite Aid assets On June 28, 2017, the Company entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement (the Asset Purchase Agreement) with Rite Aid, pursuant to which the Company agreed, subject to the terms and conditions thereof, to acquire 2,186 stores, three distribution centers and related inventory from Rite Aid. On September 19, 2017, the Company announced it had secured regulatory clearance for an amended and restated asset purchase agreement (the Amended and Restated Asset Purchase Agreement) to purchase 1,932 stores, three distribution centers and related inventory from Rite Aid for $4.375 billion in cash and other consideration. As of the date of this report, the first few Rite Aid stores have been acquired. Ownership of stores is expected to be transferred in phases, with the goal being to complete the store transfers in spring 2018. These transfers remain subject to closing conditions set forth in the Amended and Restated Asset Purchase Agreement. The Company will account for this transaction as a business combination. Industry overview The retail pharmacy and pharmaceutical wholesale industries across the globe are highly competitive and have been experiencing consolidation in recent years. Prescription drugs play a significant role in healthcare and constitute a first line of treatment for many medical conditions. We believe the long-term outlook for prescription drug utilization is strong due, in part, to aging populations, increases in life expectancy, increases in the availability and utilization of generic drugs, the continued development of innovative drugs that improve quality of life and control healthcare costs, and increases in the number of persons with insurance coverage for prescription drugs, including, in the United States, baby boomers increasingly becoming eligible for the federally funded Medicare Part D prescription program. Pharmaceutical wholesalers act as a vital link between drug manufacturers and pharmacies and healthcare providers in supplying pharmaceuticals to patients. The retail pharmacy industry across the globe relies significantly on private and governmental third party payers. Many private organizations throughout the healthcare industry, including pharmacy benefit management (PBM) companies and health insurance companies, have consolidated in recent years to create larger healthcare enterprises with greater bargaining power. Third party payers, including the Medicare Part D plans and the state-sponsored Medicaid and related managed care Medicaid agencies in the United States, can change eligibility requirements or reduce certain reimbursement rates. In addition, in many European countries, the government provides or subsidizes healthcare to consumers and regulates pharmaceutical prices, patient eligibility and reimbursement levels to control costs for the government-sponsored healthcare system. Changes in law or regulation also can impact reimbursement rates and terms. For example, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (the - 3 - ACA) was enacted to help control federal healthcare spending, including for prescription drugs, in the United States and the UK Department of Health plans to implement funding cuts to reduce costs within the National Health Service by reducing drug reimbursement rates. These changes generally are expected to reduce Medicaid reimbursements in the United States and pharmacy reimbursements in the UK. State Medicaid programs are also expected to continue to seek reductions in reimbursements. When third party payers or governmental authorities take actions that restrict eligibility or reduce prices or reimbursement rates, sales and margins in the retail pharmacy industry could be reduced, which would adversely affect industry profitability. In some cases, these possible adverse effects may be partially or entirely offset by controlling inventory costs and other expenses, dispensing more higher margin generics, finding new revenue streams through pharmacy services or other offerings and/or dispensing a greater volume of prescriptions. Generic prescription drugs have continued to help lower overall costs for customers and third party payers. We expect the utilization of generic pharmaceuticals to continue to increase. In general, in the United States, generic versions of drugs generate lower sales dollars per prescription, but higher gross profit dollars, as compared with patent-protected brand name drugs. The impact on retail pharmacy gross profit dollars can be significant in the first several months after a generic version of a drug is first allowed to compete with the branded version, which is generally referred to as a generic conversion. In any given year, the number of major brand name drugs that undergo a conversion from branded to generic status can vary and the timing of generic conversions can be difficult to predict, which can have a significant impact on retail pharmacy sales and gross profit dollars. We expect that market demand, government regulation, third-party reimbursement policies, government contracting requirements and other pressures will continue to cause the industries in which we compete to evolve. Pharmacists are on the frontlines of the healthcare delivery system, and we believe rising healthcare costs and the limited supply of primary care physicians present new opportunities for pharmacists and retail pharmacies to play an even greater role in driving positive outcomes for patients and payers through expanded service offerings such as immunizations and other preventive care, healthcare clinics, pharmacist-led medication therapy management and chronic condition management. Segments Our operations are organized into three divisions, which are also our reportable segments:  ##TABLE_START  Retail Pharmacy USA; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Retail Pharmacy International; and ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Pharmaceutical Wholesale. ##TABLE_END For fiscal 2017 , our segment sales were: Retail Pharmacy USA, $87.3 billion ; Retail Pharmacy International, $11.8 billion ; and Pharmaceutical Wholesale, $21.2 billion . Additional information relating to our segments is included in managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in part II, item 7 below and in note 17, segment reporting to our Consolidated Financial Statements included in part II, item 8 below, which information is incorporated herein by reference. Retail Pharmacy USA Our Retail Pharmacy USA division (excluding equity method investments) has pharmacy-led health and beauty retail offerings in 50 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands, each focused on helping people feel happy and healthy. We operated 8,100 retail stores in the division as of August 31, 2017 . Our principal retail pharmacy brands in the division are Walgreens and Duane Reade. We are a market leader in the United States and, as of August 31, 2017 , approximately 76% of the population of the United States lived within five miles of a Walgreens or Duane Reade retail pharmacy. We provide customers with convenient, omni-channel access to consumer goods and services, including own branded general merchandise such as NICE!, DeLish  , Soap and Glory, No7, and Well at Walgreens, as well as pharmacy and health and wellness services in communities across America. Integrated with our e-commerce platform, the Walgreens mobile application allows customers to refill prescriptions through scan technology, receive alerts when a refill is due and perform retail functionality, such as ordering photo prints, shopping for products and clipping coupons. Our services help improve health outcomes for patients and manage costs for payers including employers, managed care organizations, health systems, PBM companies and the public sector. We utilize our retail network as a channel to provide health and wellness services to our customers and patients, as illustrated by our ability to play a significant role in providing flu vaccines and other immunizations. We also provide specialty pharmacy and mail services. As of August 31, 2017 , we had approximately 400 in-store clinic locations throughout the United States, some of which are operated by the Company and - 4 - some of which are operated by health system partners. We have more than 78,000 healthcare service providers, including pharmacists, pharmacy technicians, nurse practitioners and other health related professionals. The components of the divisions sales are Pharmacy (the sale of prescription drugs and provision of pharmacy-related services) and Retail (the sale of healthcare and retail products including non-prescription drugs, beauty, toiletries and general merchandise). The divisions sales are subject to the influence of seasonality, particularly the winter holiday and cough, cold and flu seasons. This seasonality also can affect the divisions proportion of sales between Retail and Pharmacy during certain periods. The components of the divisions fiscal year sales were as follows: ##TABLE_START   Fiscal 2017  Fiscal 2016  Fiscal 2015 Pharmacy  %  %  % Retail  %  %  % Total  %  %  % ##TABLE_ENDWe filled 764.4 million prescriptions (including immunizations) in the division in fiscal 2017 . Adjusted to 30-day equivalents, prescriptions filled were 989.7 million in fiscal 2017 . Sales where reimbursement is received from managed care organizations, governmental agencies, PBM companies and private insurance were approximately 98% of the divisions fiscal 2017 pharmacy sales. We fill prescriptions for many state Medicaid public assistance programs. Sales from all such Medicaid plans were approximately 4% of the divisions fiscal 2017 sales. Sales from Medicare Part D plans were approximately 19% of the divisions fiscal 2017 sales. Our U.S. loyalty program, Balance Rewards, is designed to reward our most valuable customers and encourage shopping in stores and online. Balance Rewards members receive special pricing on select products and earn everyday rewards points for purchasing most merchandise that can be instantly redeemed at our stores or through walgreens.com. As of August 31, 2017 , the number of active Balance Rewards members totaled 88.2 million . For this purpose, we define an active member as someone who has used their card in the last six months. AmerisourceBergen supplies and distributes a significant amount of generic and branded pharmaceutical products to the divisions pharmacies. We purchase our non-pharmaceutical merchandise from numerous manufacturers and wholesalers. The divisions sales, gross profit margin and gross profit are impacted by, among other things, both the percentage of prescriptions that we fill that are generic and the rate at which new generic drugs are introduced to the market. Because any number of factors outside of our control can affect timing for a generic conversion, we face substantial uncertainty in predicting when such conversions will occur and what effect they will have on particular future periods. The current environment of our pharmacy business also includes ongoing reimbursement pressure and a shift in pharmacy mix towards 90-day at retail (one prescription that is the equivalent of three 30-day prescriptions) and Medicare Part D prescriptions. Further consolidation among generic manufacturers coupled with changes in the number of major brand name drugs anticipated to undergo a conversion from branded to generic status may also result in gross margin pressures within the industry. We continuously face reimbursement pressure from PBM companies, health maintenance organizations, managed care organizations and other commercial third party payers; our agreements with these payers are regularly subject to expiration, termination or renegotiation. In addition, plan changes with rate adjustments often occur in January and our reimbursement arrangements may provide for rate adjustments at prescribed intervals during their term. We experienced lower reimbursement rates in fiscal 2017 as compared to the same period in the prior year. We expect these pressures to continue. We also have worked to develop and expand our relationships with commercial third party payers to enable new and/or improved market access via participation in pharmacy provider networks they offer. The prescription volume impact of new agreements and relationships typically is incremental over time. Our 90-day at retail prescription drug offering is typically at a lower margin than comparable 30-day prescriptions, but provides us with the opportunity to increase business with patients with chronic prescription needs while offering increased convenience, helping facilitate improved prescription adherence and resulting in a lower cost to fill the 90-day prescription. - 5 - Retail Pharmacy International Our Retail Pharmacy International division (excluding equity method investments) has pharmacy-led health and beauty retail businesses in eight countries, each focused on helping people look and feel their best. We operated 4,722 retail stores in the division as of August 31, 2017 (see properties in part I, item 2 below for information regarding geographic coverage), and have grown our online presence significantly in recent years. Our principal retail pharmacy brands are Boots in the United Kingdom, Thailand, Norway, the Republic of Ireland and The Netherlands, Benavides in Mexico and Ahumada in Chile. In Europe, we are a market leader and our retail stores are conveniently located and our pharmacists are well placed to provide a significant role in the provision of healthcare services, working closely with other primary healthcare providers in the communities we serve. The Boots omni-channel offering is differentiated from that of competitors due to the product brands we own, such as No7, Boots Pharmaceuticals, Soap  Glory, Liz Earle, Sleek MakeUp, Botanics, and only at Boots exclusive products, together with our long established reputation for trust and customer care. Our brands portfolio is enhanced by our in-house product research and development capabilities. Our retail store networks are typically complemented by online platforms. In the United Kingdom, through the boots.com website and integrated mobile application, our order and collect service allows customers to order from a range of over 35,000 products by 8:00 p.m. and collect from noon the following day from approximately 99% of the United Kingdoms retail stores as of August 31, 2017 . The Boots Advantage Card loyalty program, where customers earn points on purchases for redemption at a later date, continues to be a key element of the Boots offering. As of August 31, 2017 , the number of active Boots Advantage Card members totaled 15.5 million . For this purpose, we define an active member as someone who has used their card in the last six months. In addition, Boots in the United Kingdom is one of the leaders in the optical market with 637 practices, of which 178 operated on a franchise basis as of August 31, 2017 . Approximately 30% of these optical practices are located in Boots stores with the balance being standalone optical practices. The components of the divisions sales are Pharmacy (typically the sale of prescription drugs and provision of pharmacy-related services, subject to variation in particular jurisdictions depending upon regulatory and other factors) and Retail (primarily the sale of health and beauty products including beauty, toiletries and lifestyle merchandising, non-prescription drugs and, in the United Kingdom, the provision of optical services). The divisions sales are subject to the influence of seasonality, with the second fiscal quarter typically the strongest as a result of the winter holiday period. This seasonality affects the divisions proportion of sales between Retail and Pharmacy during certain periods. The components of the divisions fiscal year sales were as follows: ##TABLE_START   Fiscal 2017  Fiscal 2016  Fiscal 2015 1 Pharmacy  %  %  % Retail  %  %  % Total  %  %  % ##TABLE_END1 Fiscal 2015 includes periods subsequent to the Second Step Transaction (January through August 2015). The divisions Retail sales, gross profit margin and gross profit dollars are impacted by, among other things, the highly competitive nature of the health and beauty category, specifically our and our competitors pricing actions, promotional offers and events and our customers desire for value and convenience. The divisions Pharmacy sales, gross margin and gross profit dollars are impacted by governmental agencies and other third party payers seeking to minimize increases in the costs of healthcare, including pharmaceutical drug reimbursement rates. In the United Kingdom, which is the divisions largest market for Pharmacy sales, the amount of government funding available for pharmacy services is typically reviewed and agreed with the pharmacy industry on an annual basis. In fiscal 2018 , the UK Department of Health has indicated that they plan to implement funding cuts to reduce costs within the National Health Service, the publicly-funded healthcare system. In addition, performance as measured in U.S. dollars is impacted by the exchange rates used to translate these amounts into U.S. dollars, the exchange rate of British Pound Sterling being the most significant. - 6 - Pharmaceutical Wholesale Our Pharmaceutical Wholesale division (excluding equity method investments), which mainly operates under the Alliance Healthcare brand, supplies medicines, other healthcare products and related services to more than 110,000 pharmacies, doctors, health centers and hospitals each year from 289 distribution centers in 11 countries, primarily in Europe, as of August 31,  2017 . The distribution of prescription medicines to pharmacists comprises the vast majority of the divisions sales. Our wholesale businesses seek to provide high core service levels to pharmacists in terms of frequency of delivery, product availability, delivery accuracy, timeliness and reliability at competitive prices. We also offer customers innovative added-value services to help pharmacists develop their own businesses. This includes membership of Alphega Pharmacy, our pan-European network for independent pharmacies, which, as of August 31, 2017 , had over 6,300 members. In addition to the wholesale of medicines and other healthcare products, our businesses provide services to pharmaceutical manufacturers which are increasingly seeking to gain greater control over their product distribution, while at the same time outsourcing non-core activities. These services include pre-wholesale and contract logistics (mainly under the Alloga brand), direct deliveries to pharmacies, and innovative and specialized healthcare services, covering clinical homecare, medicine support, dispensing services, medicine preparation and clinical trial support (mainly under the Alcura brand). Combined with local engagement, scale is important in pharmaceutical wholesaling. We are one of the largest pharmaceutical wholesalers and distributors in Europe, and we rank as one of the top three in market share in many of the individual countries in which we operate. The divisions sales, gross profit margin and gross profit dollars are impacted by, among other things, government actions, which typically seek to reduce the growth in prescription drug consumption, reduce reimbursement rates and increase generic drug utilization. A greater proportion of generic drugs, whether as a result of government actions, generic conversions or other factors, typically has an adverse effect on our revenues. However, in the wholesale division we typically earn equal or better gross margins on generic drugs than on branded drugs, although there are exceptions. Changes in manufacturers product distribution business models can also impact the divisions sales and gross margin. For example, when pharmaceutical drug manufacturers introduce fee-for-service contracts, it reduces our sales even if we are successful in winning these contracts, as we only recognize sales for the amount of the fees charged. Other manufacturer services, including our pre-wholesale and contract logistics operations are typically on a fee-for-service basis. In addition, performance as measured in U.S. dollars is impacted by the exchange rates used to translate these amounts into U.S. dollars, the exchange rate of British Pounds Sterling and the Euro being the most significant. The divisions sales are subject to less seasonality than our other divisions. Intellectual property and licenses We market products and services under various trademarks, trade dress and trade names and rely on a combination of patent, copyright, trademark, service mark and trade secret laws, as well as contractual restrictions to establish and protect our proprietary rights. We own numerous domain names, hold numerous patents, have registered numerous trademarks and have filed applications for the registration of a number of our other trademarks and service marks in various jurisdictions. We hold assorted business licenses (such as pharmacy, occupational, liquor and cigarette) having various lives within multiple legal jurisdictions, which are necessary for the normal operation of our business. Seasonal variations in business Our business is affected by a number of factors including, among others, our sales performance during holiday periods (including particularly the winter holiday season) and during the cough, cold and flu season (the timing and severity of which is difficult to predict), significant weather conditions, the timing of our own or competitor discount programs and pricing actions, and the timing of changes in levels of reimbursement from governmental agencies and other third party payers. See summary of quarterly results (unaudited) in note 19, supplementary financial information to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in part II, item 8 below. Sources and availability of raw materials Inventories are purchased from numerous domestic and foreign suppliers. We do not believe that the loss of any one supplier or group of suppliers under common control would have a material adverse effect on our business or that of any of our divisions. - 7 - Working capital practices Effective inventory management is important to our operations. We use various inventory management techniques, including demand forecasting and planning and various forms of replenishment management. Our working capital needs typically are greater in the months leading up to the winter holiday season. We generally finance our inventory and expansion needs with internally generated funds and short-term borrowings. For additional information, see the liquidity and capital resources section in managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in part II, item 7 below. Customers We sell to numerous retail and wholesale customers. No single customer accounted for more than 10% of the Companys consolidated sales for any of the periods presented. Two payers accounted for approximately 25% of the Retail Pharmacy USA divisions sales in fiscal 2017 . One payer in the Retail Pharmacy International division accounted for approximately 18% of the divisions sales in fiscal 2017 . Regulation In the countries in which we do business, we are subject to national, state and local laws, regulations, and administrative practices concerning retail and wholesale pharmacy operations, including regulations relating to our participation in Medicare, Medicaid and other publicly financed health benefit plans; regulations prohibiting kickbacks, beneficiary inducement and the submission of false claims; the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA); the ACA; licensure and registration requirements concerning the operation of pharmacies and the practice of pharmacy; and regulations of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, the U.S. Federal Trade Commission, the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration and the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission, as well as regulations promulgated by comparable foreign, state and local governmental authorities concerning the operation of our businesses. We are also subject to laws and regulations relating to licensing, tax, foreign trade, intellectual property, privacy and data protection, currency, political and other business restrictions. We are also governed by national, state and local laws of general applicability in the countries in which we do business, including laws regulating matters of working conditions, health and safety and equal employment opportunity. In connection with the operation of our businesses, we are subject to laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment and health and safety matters, including those governing exposure to, and the management and disposal of, hazardous substances. Environmental protection requirements did not have a material effect on our results of operations or capital expenditures in fiscal 2017 . Competitive conditions The industries in which we operate are highly competitive. As a leader in the retail pharmacy industry and as a retailer of general merchandise, we compete with various local, regional, national and global retailers, including chain and independent pharmacies, mail order prescription providers, grocery stores, convenience stores, mass merchants, online and omni-channel pharmacies and retailers, warehouse clubs, dollar stores and other discount merchandisers. Our pharmaceutical wholesale businesses compete with other pharmaceutical wholesalers as well as alternative supply sources such as importers and manufacturers who supply directly to pharmacies. We compete primarily on the basis of service, convenience, variety and price. Our geographic dispersion helps mitigate the impact of temporary, localized economic and competitive conditions in individual markets. See properties in part I, item 2 below for further information regarding our geographic dispersion. Employees As of August 31, 2017 , we employed approximately 345,000 persons, approximately 110,000 of whom were part-time employees working less than 30 hours per week. The foregoing does not include employees of unconsolidated partially-owned entities.  Research and development While our global brands portfolio is enhanced by our in-house product research and development capabilities, the amount we spend on research and development activities is not material. Financial information about foreign and domestic operations and export sales Prior to completion of the Second Step Transaction, we accounted for our 45% investment in Alliance Boots using the equity method of accounting and as a result, no Alliance Boots sales were included in our sales prior to December 31, 2014. In fiscal 2015, all our sales prior to the completion of the Second Step Transaction on December 31, 2014 occurred within the United States, Puerto Rico, Guam and the U.S. Virgin Islands. Subsequent to the Second Step Transaction, Alliance Boots results have been fully consolidated. Certain financial information relating to foreign and domestic operations, including total revenues and long-lived assets aggregated by our U.S. and non-U.S. operations, is included in note 17, segment reporting to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in part II, item 8 below, which information is incorporated herein by reference. See risk factors in part I, item 1A below for information regarding risks attendant to our foreign operations. - 8 - Available information We file with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC) our Annual Report on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K and any amendments to those reports, as well as proxy statements and registration statements. You may read and copy any material we file with the SEC at the SECs Public Reference Room at 100 F Street, NE, Washington, D.C. 20549. You may also obtain information on the operation of the Public Reference Room by calling the SEC at 1-800-SEC-0330. In addition, the SEC maintains a website at http://www.sec.gov that contains reports, proxy and information statements, and other information regarding issuers, including us, that file electronically. We make available free of charge on or through our website at http://investor.walgreensbootsalliance.com our Annual Reports on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K and amendments to these reports filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Exchange Act as soon as reasonably practicable after we file or furnish them to the SEC. The contents of our website are not, however, a part of this Form 10-K or our other SEC filings. ", "1A": " Item 1A. Risk factors In addition to the other information in this report and our other filings with the SEC, you should carefully consider the risks described below, which could materially and adversely affect our business operations, financial condition and results of operations. These risks are not the only risks that we face. Our business operations could also be affected by additional factors that are not presently known to us or that we currently consider to be immaterial. Reductions in third party reimbursement levels, from private or governmental agency plans, and potential changes in industry pricing benchmarks for prescription drugs could materially and adversely affect our results of operations. The substantial majority of the prescriptions we fill are reimbursed by third party payers, including private and governmental agency payers. The continued efforts of health maintenance organizations, managed care organizations, PBM companies, governmental agencies, and other third party payers to reduce prescription drug costs and pharmacy reimbursement rates, as well as litigation and other legal proceedings relating to how drugs are priced, may adversely impact our results of operations. In the United States, plan changes with rate adjustments often occur in January and our reimbursement arrangements may provide for rate adjustments at prescribed intervals during their term. In addition, in an environment where some PBM clients utilize narrow or restricted pharmacy provider networks, some of these entities may offer pricing terms that we may not be willing to accept or otherwise restrict our participation in their networks of pharmacy providers. Changes in political, economic and regulatory influences also may significantly affect healthcare financing and prescription drug reimbursement practices. In the United States, for example, there have been multiple attempts through legislative action and legal challenges to repeal or amend the ACA, in whole and in part. We cannot predict whether current or future efforts to repeal or amend these laws will be successful, nor can we predict the impact that such a repeal or amendment and any subsequent legislation would have on our business and reimbursement levels. There have also been a number of other proposals and enactments by the federal government and various states to reduce Medicare Part D and Medicaid reimbursement levels in response to budget deficits, and we expect additional proposals in the future. There can be no assurance that recent or future changes in prescription drug reimbursement policies and practices will not materially and adversely affect our results of operations. In many countries where we have operations, the government provides or subsidizes healthcare to consumers and regulates pharmaceutical prices, patient eligibility and reimbursement levels to control costs for the government-sponsored healthcare system. Efforts to control healthcare costs, including prescription drug costs, are continuous and reductions in third party reimbursement levels could materially and adversely affect our results of operations. In addition, many payers in the United States are increasingly considering new metrics as the basis for reimbursement rates, such as average sales price, average manufacturer price, and actual acquisition cost. It is possible that the pharmaceutical industry or regulators may evaluate and/or develop an alternative pricing reference to replace average wholesale price, which is the pricing reference used for many of our contracts. In addition, many state Medicaid fee-for-service programs moved to establish pharmacy network payments on the basis of actual acquisition cost by April 1, 2017, which potentially could have an impact on reimbursement practices in other commercial and government arrangements. Future changes to the pricing benchmarks used to establish pharmaceutical pricing, including changes in the basis for calculating reimbursement by third party payers, could adversely affect us. A shift in pharmacy mix toward lower margin plans and programs could adversely affect our results of operations. Our Retail Pharmacy USA division seeks to grow prescription volume while operating in a marketplace with continuous reimbursement pressure. A shift in the mix of pharmacy prescription volume towards programs offering lower reimbursement rates could adversely affect our results of operations. For example, our Retail Pharmacy USA division has experienced a shift in pharmacy mix towards 90-day at retail in recent years. Our 90-day at retail offering for patients with chronic prescription - 9 - needs typically is at a lower margin than comparable 30-day prescriptions. Our Retail Pharmacy USA division also experienced a shift in pharmacy mix towards Medicare Part D prescriptions in fiscal 2017, and that trend may continue. Preferred Medicare Part D networks have increased in number in recent years; however, we do not participate in all such networks. We have accepted lower reimbursement rates in order to secure preferred relationships with Medicare Part D plans serving senior patients with significant pharmacy needs. We also have worked to develop and expand our relationships with commercial third party payers to enable new and/or improved market access via participation in the pharmacy provider networks they offer. If we are not able to generate additional prescription volume and other business from patients participating in these programs that is sufficient to offset the impact of lower reimbursement, or if the degree or terms of our participation in such preferred networks declines from current levels in future years, our results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. We could be adversely affected by a decrease in the introduction of new brand name and generic prescription drugs as well as increases in the cost to procure prescription drugs. The profitability of our pharmacy businesses depends upon the utilization of prescription drugs. Utilization trends are affected by, among other factors, the introduction of new and successful prescription drugs as well as lower-priced generic alternatives to existing brand name drugs. Inflation in the price of drugs also can adversely affect utilization, particularly given the increased prevalence of high-deductible health insurance plans and related plan design changes. New brand name drugs can result in increased drug utilization and associated sales, while the introduction of lower priced generic alternatives typically results in relatively lower sales, but relatively higher gross profit margins. Accordingly, a decrease in the number or magnitude of significant new brand name drugs or generics successfully introduced, delays in their introduction, or a decrease in the utilization of previously introduced prescription drugs, could materially and adversely affect our results of operations. In addition, if we experience an increase in the amounts we pay to procure pharmaceutical drugs, including generic drugs, it could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. Our gross profit margins would be adversely affected to the extent we are not able to offset such cost increases. Any failure to fully offset any such increased prices and costs or to modify our activities to mitigate the impact could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. Additionally, any future changes in drug prices could be significantly different than our expectations. We derive a significant portion of our sales in the United States from prescription drug sales reimbursed by a limited number of pharmacy benefit management companies. We derive a significant portion of our sales in the United States from prescription drug sales reimbursed through prescription drug plans administered by a limited number of PBM companies. PBM companies typically administer multiple prescription drug plans that expire at various times and provide for varying reimbursement rates, and often limit coverage to specific drug products on an approved list, known as a formulary, which might not include all of the approved drugs for a particular indication. There can be no assurance that we will continue to participate in any particular PBM companys pharmacy provider network in any particular future time period. If our participation in the pharmacy provider network for a prescription drug plan administered by one or more of the large PBM companies is restricted or terminated, we expect that our sales would be adversely affected, at least in the short-term. If we are unable to replace any such lost sales, either through an increase in other sales or through a resumption of participation in those plans, our operating results could be materially and adversely affected. If we exit a pharmacy provider network and later resume participation, there can be no assurance that we will achieve any particular level of business on any particular pace, or that all clients of the PBM company will choose to include us again in the pharmacy network for their plans, initially or at all. In addition, in such circumstances we may incur increased marketing and other costs in connection with initiatives to regain former patients and attract new patients covered by such plans. Consolidation and strategic alliances in the healthcare industry could adversely affect our business operations, competitive positioning, financial condition and results of operations. Many organizations in the healthcare industry, including PBM companies, have consolidated in recent years to create larger healthcare enterprises with greater bargaining power, which has resulted in greater pricing pressures. If this consolidation trend continues, it could give the resulting enterprises even greater bargaining power, which may lead to further pressure on the prices for our products and services. If these pressures result in reductions in our prices, our businesses would become less profitable unless we are able to achieve corresponding reductions in costs or develop profitable new revenue streams. New partnerships and strategic alliances in the healthcare industry also can alter market dynamics and impact our businesses and competitive positioning. For example, following the entry into our strategic relationship with AmerisourceBergen providing for, among other things, generic drug purchasing through our global sourcing enterprise, some of our retail pharmacy competitors subsequently established relationships with other pharmaceutical drug wholesalers and others relating to generic drug procurement. Changes in the participants in such global sourcing enterprises, whether as a result of mergers, acquisitions - 10 - or other transactions, can have a similar effect. In addition, further consolidation among generic drug manufacturers could lead to generic drug inflation in the future. We expect that market demand, government regulation, third-party reimbursement policies, government contracting requirements, and other pressures will continue to cause the healthcare industry to evolve, potentially resulting in further business consolidations and alliances and increased vertical integration among the industry participants we engage with, and which could, if we are not able to successfully anticipate and respond to evolving industry conditions in a timely and effective manner, materially and adversely impact our business operations, financial condition and results of operations. Our growth strategy is partially dependent upon our ability to identify and successfully complete acquisitions, joint ventures and other strategic alliances. A significant element of our growth strategy is to identify, pursue and successfully complete acquisitions, joint ventures and other strategic alliances that either expand or complement our existing operations. We have grown significantly through acquisitions in recent years and expect to continue to acquire, partner with or invest in businesses that build on or are deemed complementary to our existing businesses or further our strategic objectives. Due in part to consolidation in the industries in which we compete, there is significant competition for attractive targets and opportunities when available. There can be no assurance that attractive acquisition or other strategic relationship opportunities will be available, that we will be successful in identifying, negotiating and consummating favorable transaction opportunities, or that any such transactions we complete will be successful and justify our investment of financial and other resources therein. Acquisitions and other strategic transactions involve numerous risks, including difficulties in successfully integrating the operations and personnel, distraction of management from overseeing, and disruption of, our existing operations, difficulties in entering markets or lines of business in which we have no or limited direct prior experience, the possible loss of key employees and customers, and difficulties in achieving the synergies we anticipated. Any failure to select suitable opportunities at fair prices, conduct appropriate due diligence and successfully integrate the acquired company, including particularly when acquired businesses operate in new geographic markets or areas of business, could materially and adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations. These transactions may also cause us to significantly increase our interest expense, leverage and debt service requirements if we incur additional debt to pay for an acquisition or investment, issue common stock that would dilute our current stockholders percentage ownership, or incur asset write-offs and restructuring costs and other related expenses that could have a material adverse impact on our operating results. Acquisitions, joint ventures and strategic investments also involve numerous other risks, including potential exposure to assumed litigation and unknown environmental and other liabilities, as well as undetected internal control, regulatory or other issues, or additional costs not anticipated at the time the transaction was completed. No assurance can be given that our acquisitions, joint ventures and other strategic alliances will be successful and will not materially adversely affect our business operations, financial condition or results of operations. If we are unable to successfully identify, complete and integrate acquisitions, joint ventures and strategic investments in a timely and effective manner, our business operations and growth strategies could be negatively affected. Our strategic relationships include outsourcing and similar relationships. We outsource certain business and administrative functions and rely on third parties to perform certain services on our behalf. For example, in July 2017 we announced a binding offer from Fareva for a 10-year global agreement for the manufacture and supply of own beauty brands and private label products. Under the terms of the proposed agreement, Fareva will take ownership of BCM, Walgreens Boots Alliances contract manufacturing business, which operates factories in the United Kingdom, France and Germany. The proposed agreement, which is subject to certain closing conditions, is expected to be completed by the end of calendar year 2017. We rely on these third parties to meet our quality and performance requirements and to timely perform as expected. We periodically negotiate provisions and renewals of these relationships, and there can be no assurance that such terms will remain acceptable to us or such third parties. If our continuing relationship with certain third-party providers is interrupted, or if such third-party providers experience disruptions or do not perform as anticipated, or we experience problems with any transition, we may experience operational difficulties, reputational harm, and increased costs that could materially and adversely affect our business operations and results of operations. We may not be able to successfully or timely complete the acquisition of certain Rite Aid assets. Risks and uncertainties related to our acquisition of 1,932 stores, three distribution centers and related inventory from Rite Aid pursuant to the Amended and Restated Asset Purchase Agreement include, among others, the occurrence of any event, change or other circumstance that could impact our ability to complete the closing conditions set forth in the Amended and Restated Asset Purchase Agreement, including that litigation may be filed which could prevent or delay completion of the transaction, and that uncertainty regarding the transaction may adversely affect relationships with suppliers, payers, customers and other third parties. While we have completed the acquisition of the first few Rite Aid stores pursuant to the Amended and Restated Asset Purchase Agreement as of the date of this report, ownership of stores is expected to be transferred in phases, with the - 11 - goal being to complete the store transfers in spring 2018. Completion of the remaining asset acquisition transactions is subject to the satisfaction of the applicable conditions set forth in the Amended and Restated Asset Purchase Agreement. We will be unable to complete the acquisition of these Rite Aid assets until each of the conditions to closing is either satisfied or waived. We have incurred and will continue to incur significant costs, expenses and fees for professional services and other transaction costs in connection with the transaction, as well as the diversion of management resources, for which we will receive little or no benefit if the closing of the remaining asset acquisitions do not occur. We may not realize the anticipated benefits of the acquisition of certain Rite Aid assets pursuant to the Amended and Restated Asset Purchase Agreement, which could adversely impact our results of operations. We entered into the Amended and Restated Asset Purchase Agreement to acquire certain Rite Aid stores and distribution centers with the expectation that the transaction will result in various benefits, including, among other things, cost savings and operating efficiencies. The achievement of the anticipated benefits of the transaction is subject to a number of uncertainties, including whether the acquired assets can be integrated into our business in an efficient and effective manner, the possibility of faulty assumptions underlying expectations regarding potential synergies and the integration process, unforeseen expenses or delays, and competitive factors in the marketplace. We can provide no assurance that the anticipated benefits of the transaction, including cost savings and synergies, will be fully realized in the time frame anticipated or at all; the costs or difficulties related to the integration of the acquired assets into our business and operations will not be greater than expected; unanticipated costs, charges and expenses will not result from the transaction; litigation relating to the transaction will not be filed; and the transaction will not cause disruption to the parties business and operations and relationships with employees and suppliers, payers, customers and other third parties. If one or more of these risks are realized, it could have a material adverse impact on our operating results. We could also encounter unforeseen transaction and integration-related costs or other circumstances, such as unforeseen liabilities or other issues resulting from the transaction. Many of these potential circumstances are outside of our control and any of them could result in increased costs, decreased revenue, decreased synergies and the diversion of management time and attention, which could adversely impact our agility to respond to market opportunities and our ability to timely identify and implement other strategic actions. If we are unable to achieve our objectives within the anticipated time frame, or at all, the expected benefits may not be realized fully or at all, or may take longer to realize than expected, which could have a material adverse impact on our business operations, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, we have incurred significant transaction costs related to the transaction and expect to continue to incur significant integration and related costs as we integrate the acquired Rite Aid assets. These integration and acquisition-related costs, including legal, accounting, financial and tax advisory and other fees and costs, may be higher than expected and some of these costs may be material. Our substantial international business operations subject us to a number of operating, economic, political, regulatory and other international business risks. Our substantial international business operations are important to our growth and prospects, including particularly those of our Retail Pharmacy International and Pharmaceutical Wholesale divisions, and are subject to a number of risks, including: ##TABLE_START  compliance with a wide variety of foreign laws and regulations, including retail and wholesale pharmacy, licensing, tax, foreign trade, intellectual property, privacy and data protection, immigration, currency, political and other business restrictions and requirements and local laws and regulations, whose interpretation and enforcement vary significantly among jurisdictions and can change significantly over time; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  additional U.S. and other regulation of non-domestic operations, including regulation under the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the U.K. Bribery Act and other anti-corruption laws; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  potential difficulties in managing foreign operations, mitigating credit risks in foreign markets, enforcing agreements and collecting receivables through foreign legal systems; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  price controls imposed by foreign countries; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  tariffs, duties or other restrictions on foreign currencies or trade sanctions and other trade barriers imposed by foreign countries that restrict or prohibit business transactions in certain markets; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  potential adverse tax consequences, including tax withholding laws and policies and restrictions on repatriation of funds to the United States; ##TABLE_END - 12 - ##TABLE_START  fluctuations in currency exchange rates; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  impact of recessions and economic slowdowns in economies outside the United States, including foreign currency devaluation, higher interest rates, inflation, and increased government regulation or ownership of traditional private businesses; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  the instability of foreign economies, governments and currencies and unexpected regulatory, economic or political changes in foreign markets; and ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  developing and emerging markets may be especially vulnerable to periods of instability and unexpected changes, and consumers in those markets may have relatively limited resources to spend on products and services. ##TABLE_END These factors can also adversely affect our payers, vendors and customers in international markets, which in turn can negatively impact our businesses. We cannot assure you that one or more of these factors will not have a material adverse effect on our business operations, results of operation and financial condition. Many of these factors are subject to change based on changes in political, economic and regulatory influences. For example: ##TABLE_START  Our Retail Pharmacy International and Pharmaceutical Wholesale divisions have substantial operations in the United Kingdom and other member countries of the European Union. On June 23, 2016, voters in the United Kingdom approved an advisory referendum to withdraw from the European Union, which proposed exit (and the political, economic and other uncertainties it has raised) has exacerbated and may further exacerbate many of the risks and uncertainties described above. Negotiations on withdrawal and post-exit arrangements likely will be complex and protracted, and there can be no assurance regarding the terms, timing or consummation of any such arrangements. The proposed withdrawal could, among other potential outcomes, adversely affect the tax, tax treaty, currency, operational, legal and regulatory regimes to which our businesses in the region are subject. The withdrawal could also, among other potential outcomes, disrupt the free movement of goods, services and people between the United Kingdom and the European Union and significantly disrupt trade between the United Kingdom and the European Union and other parties. Further, uncertainty around these and related issues could lead to adverse effects on the economy of the United Kingdom and the other economies in which we operate. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  Many of the products we sell are manufactured in whole or in part outside of the United States. In some cases, these products are imported by others and sold to us. Following the November 2016 election in the United States, the new Administration has discussed or sought to implement changes with respect to certain tax and trade policies, tariffs and other government regulations affecting trade between the United States and other countries. While it is not possible to predict whether or when any such changes will occur or what form they may take, significant changes in tax or trade policies, tariffs or trade relations between the United States and other countries could result in significant increases in our costs, restrict our access to certain suppliers and adversely impact economic activity. In addition, other countries may change their business and trade policies in anticipation of or in response to increased import tariffs and other changes in United States trade policy and regulations. ##TABLE_END There can be no assurance that any or all of these developments will not have a material adverse effect on our business operations, results of operations and financial condition. We are exposed to risks associated with foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. Our significant operations outside of the United States expose us to currency exchange rate fluctuations and related risks, including transaction currency exposures relating to the import and export of goods in currencies other than businesses functional currencies as well as currency translation exposures relating to profits and net assets denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. We present our financial statements in U.S. dollars and have a significant proportion of net assets and income in non-U.S. dollar currencies, primarily the British Pound Sterling and the Euro, as well as a range of other foreign currencies. Our results of operations and capital ratios can therefore be sensitive to movements in foreign exchange rates. Due to the constantly changing currency exposures to which we are subject and the volatility of currency exchange rates, we cannot predict the effect of exchange rate fluctuations upon our future results of operations. In addition, fluctuations in currencies relative to the U.S. dollar may make it more difficult to perform period-to-period comparisons of our reported results of operations. A depreciation of non-U.S. dollar currencies relative to the U.S. dollar could have a significant adverse impact on our results of operations. - 13 - We may from time to time, in some instances, enter into foreign currency contracts or other derivative instruments intended to hedge a portion of our foreign currency fluctuation risks, which subjects us to additional risks, such as the risk that counterparties may fail to honor their obligations to us, that could materially and adversely affect us. Additionally, we may (and currently do) use foreign currency borrowings to hedge some of our foreign currency fluctuation risks. The periodic use of such hedging activities may not offset any or more than a portion of the adverse financial effects of unfavorable movements in foreign exchange rates over the limited time the hedges are in place. We cannot assure you that fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, including particularly the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against major currencies or the currencies of large developing countries, will not materially affect our consolidated financial results. Our business results depend on our ability to successfully manage ongoing organizational change and business transformation and achieve cost savings and operating efficiency initiatives. Our Board of Directors approved the plan to implement the Store Optimization Program described in managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in part II, item 7 below as part of an initiative to reduce costs and increase operating efficiencies. There can be no assurance that we will realize, in full or in part, the anticipated benefits of this program. Our financial goals assume a level of productivity improvement, including those reflected in the Store Optimization Program and other business optimization initiatives. If we are unable to deliver these expected productivity improvements, while continuing to invest in business growth, or if the volume and nature of change overwhelms available resources, our business operations and financial results could be materially and adversely impacted. Our ability to successfully manage and execute these initiatives and realize expected savings and benefits in the amounts and at the times anticipated is important to our business success. Any failure to do so, which could result from our inability to successfully execute organizational change and business transformation plans, changes in global or regional economic conditions, competition, changes in the industries in which we compete, unanticipated costs or charges, loss of key personnel and other factors described herein, could have a material adverse effect on our businesses, financial condition and results of operations. Disruption in our global supply chain could negatively impact our businesses. The products we sell are sourced from a wide variety of domestic and international vendors, and any future disruption in our supply chain or inability to find qualified vendors and access products that meet requisite quality and safety standards in a timely and efficient manner could adversely impact our businesses. The loss or disruption of such supply arrangements for any reason, including for issues such as labor disputes, loss or impairment of key manufacturing sites, inability to procure sufficient raw materials, quality control issues, ethical sourcing issues, a suppliers financial distress, natural disasters, civil unrest or acts of war or terrorism, trade sanctions or other external factors over which we have no control, could interrupt product supply and, if not effectively managed and remedied, have a material adverse impact on our business operations, financial condition and results of operations. We use a single wholesaler of branded and generic pharmaceutical drugs as our primary source of such products for our Retail Pharmacy USA division. In March 2013, Walgreens, Alliance Boots and AmerisourceBergen announced various agreements and arrangements, including a ten-year pharmaceutical distribution agreement between Walgreens and AmerisourceBergen pursuant to which we source branded and generic pharmaceutical products from AmerisourceBergen in the U.S. and an agreement which provides AmerisourceBergen the ability to access generics pharmaceutical products through our global sourcing enterprise. In May 2016, certain of these agreements were extended for three years to now expire in 2026. In addition, in March 2013, Walgreens, Alliance Boots and AmerisourceBergen entered into agreements and arrangements pursuant to which we have the right, but not the obligation, to purchase a minority equity position in AmerisourceBergen and gain associated representation on AmerisourceBergens board of directors in certain circumstances. As of the date of this report, AmerisourceBergen distributes for our Retail Pharmacy USA division substantially all branded and generic pharmaceutical products. Consequently, our business in the United States may be adversely affected by any operational, financial or regulatory difficulties that AmerisourceBergen experiences. For example, if AmerisourceBergens operations are seriously disrupted for any reason, whether due to a natural disaster, labor disruption, regulatory action, computer or operational systems or otherwise, it could adversely affect our business in the United States and our results of operations. Our distribution agreement with AmerisourceBergen is subject to early termination in certain circumstances and, upon the expiration or termination of the agreement, there can be no assurance that we or AmerisourceBergen will be willing to renew the agreement or enter into a new agreement, on terms favorable to us or at all. If such expiration or termination occurred, we believe that alternative sources of supply for most generic and brand-name pharmaceuticals are readily available and that we could obtain and qualify alternative sources, which may include self-distribution in some cases, for substantially all of the prescription drugs we sell on an acceptable basis, such that the impact of any such expiration or termination would be - 14 - temporary. However, there can be no assurance we would be able to engage alternative supply sources or implement self-distribution processes on a timely basis or on terms favorable to us, or effectively manage these transitions, any of which could adversely affect our business operations, financial condition and results of operations. The anticipated strategic and financial benefits of our relationship with AmerisourceBergen may not be realized. We entered into the arrangement with AmerisourceBergen with the expectation that the transactions contemplated thereby would result in various benefits including, among other things, procurement cost savings and operating efficiencies, innovation and sharing of best practices. The processes and initiatives needed to achieve these potential benefits are complex, costly and time-consuming. Many of the anticipated synergies and expenses that will be incurred, by their nature, are difficult to estimate accurately at the present time. Achieving the anticipated benefits from the arrangement is subject to a number of significant challenges and uncertainties, including the possibility of faulty assumptions underlying expectations, processes or initiatives, or the inability to realize and/or delays in realizing potential benefits and synergies, whether unique corporate cultures of separate organizations will work collaboratively in an efficient and effective manner, unforeseen expenses or delays, and competitive factors in the marketplace. As of August 31, 2017, we beneficially owned approximately 26% of the outstanding AmerisourceBergen common stock and had designated one member of AmerisourceBergens board of directors. In addition, we have the right, but not the obligation, under the transactions contemplated by the Framework Agreement dated as of March 18, 2013 by and among the Company, Alliance Boots and AmerisourceBergen (the Framework Agreement) to acquire up to an additional 8,398,752 AmerisourceBergen shares in the open market and thereafter designate another member of AmerisourceBergens board of directors, subject in each case to applicable legal and contractual requirements. There can be no assurance that we will complete any specific level of such potential equity investments in AmerisourceBergen, or that our existing investment, or any future investment if completed, will ultimately be profitable. If the price of AmerisourceBergen common stock subsequently declines substantially, we could experience a loss on or impairment of such investment, which could materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. Further, our ability to transact in AmerisourceBergen securities is subject to certain restrictions set forth in our agreements with AmerisourceBergen and arising under applicable laws and regulations, which in some circumstances could adversely our ability to transact in AmerisourceBergen securities in amounts and at the times desired. We could also encounter unforeseen costs, circumstances or issues existing or arising with respect to the transactions and collaboration we anticipate resulting from the Framework Agreement. Many of these potential circumstances are outside of our control and any of them could result in increased costs, decreased revenue, decreased synergies and the diversion of management time and attention. If we are unable to achieve our objectives within the anticipated time frame, or at all, the expected benefits may not be realized fully or at all, or may take longer to realize than expected, which could have a material adverse impact on our business operations, financial condition and results of operations. From time to time, we make investments in companies over which we do not have sole control. Some of these companies may operate in sectors that differ from our current operations and have different risks. From time to time, we make debt or equity investments in companies that we may not control or over which we may not have sole control. For example, while we have a significant equity investment in AmerisourceBergen and have a designee serving on the board of directors of AmerisourceBergen as of the date of this report, we do not have the ability to control day-to-day operations of that company. Although the businesses in which we have made non-controlling investments often have a significant health and daily living or prescription drug component, some of them operate in businesses that are different from our primary lines of business and/or operate in different geographic markets than we do. Investments in these businesses, among other risks, subject us to the operating and financial risks of the businesses we invest in and to the risk that we do not have sole control over the operations of these businesses. We rely on the internal controls and financial reporting controls of these entities and their failure to maintain effectiveness or comply with applicable standards may materially and adversely affect us. Investments in entities over which we do not have sole control, including joint ventures and strategic alliances, present additional risks such as having differing objectives from our partners or the entities in which we are invested, becoming involved in disputes, or competing with those persons. From time to time, we may make additional investments in or acquire other entities that may subject us to similar risks. Changes in economic conditions could adversely affect consumer buying practices. Our performance has been, and may continue to be, adversely impacted by changes in global, national, regional or local economic conditions and consumer confidence. These conditions can also adversely affect our key vendors and customers. External factors that affect consumer confidence and over which we exercise no influence include unemployment rates, inflation, levels of personal disposable income, levels of taxes and interest and global, national, regional or local economic conditions, as well as acts of war or terrorism. Changes in economic conditions and consumer confidence could adversely - 15 - affect consumer preferences, purchasing power and spending patterns, which could lead to a decrease in overall consumer spending as well as in prescription drug and health services utilization and which could be exacerbated by the increasing prevalence of high-deductible health insurance plans and related plan design changes. In addition, reduced or flat consumer spending may drive us and our competitors to offer additional products at promotional prices. All of these factors could materially and adversely impact our business operations, financial condition and results of operations. Economic conditions in Europe and certain emerging market countries, together with austerity measures being taken by certain governments, could adversely affect us. We have significant assets and operations within Europe and certain emerging market countries in our Retail Pharmacy International and Pharmaceutical Wholesale divisions. An economic slowdown within any such markets could adversely affect our businesses in affected regions by reducing the prices our customers may be able or willing to pay for our products and services or by reducing the demand for our products and services, either of which could result in a material adverse impact on our results of operations. In recent years, in response to the economic environment, a number of governments, including the government in the United Kingdom, have announced or implemented austerity measures to reduce healthcare spending for the government-sponsored healthcare systems and constrain overall government expenditures. These measures, which include efforts aimed at reforming healthcare coverage and reducing healthcare costs, continue to exert pressure on the pricing of and reimbursement timelines for pharmaceutical drugs. Countries with existing austerity measures may impose additional laws, regulations, or requirements on the healthcare industry. In addition, governments that have not yet imposed austerity measures may impose them in the future. Any new austerity measures may be similar to or vary in scope and nature from existing austerity measures and could have a material adverse effect on our international business operations and results of operations. The industries in which we operate are highly competitive and constantly evolving. New entrants to the market, existing competitor actions, or other changes in market dynamics could adversely impact us. The level of competition in the retail pharmacy and pharmaceutical wholesale industries is high. Changes in market dynamics or actions of competitors or manufacturers, including industry consolidation and the emergence of new competitors and strategic alliances, could materially and adversely impact us. Disruptive innovation by existing or new competitors could alter the competitive landscape in the future and require us to accurately identify and assess such changes and make timely and effective changes to our strategies and business model to compete effectively. Our retail pharmacy businesses face intense competition from local, regional, national and global companies, including other drugstore and pharmacy chains, independent drugstores and pharmacies, mail-order pharmacies and various other retailers such as grocery stores, convenience stores, mass merchants, online and omni-channel pharmacies and retailers, warehouse clubs, dollar stores and other discount merchandisers, some of which are aggressively expanding in markets we serve. Businesses in our Pharmaceutical Wholesale division face intense competition from direct competitors, including national and regional cooperative wholesalers, and alternative supply sources such as importers and manufacturers who supply directly to pharmacies. Competition may also come from other sources in the future. As competition increases in the markets in which we operate, a significant increase in general pricing pressures could occur, which could require us to reevaluate our pricing structures to remain competitive. For example, if we are not able to anticipate and successfully respond to changes in market conditions in our Pharmaceutical Wholesale division, including changes driven by competitors, suppliers or manufacturers and increased competition from national and regional cooperative wholesalers, it could result in a loss of customers or renewal of contracts or arrangements on less favorable terms. We also could be adversely affected if we fail to identify or effectively respond to changes in market dynamics. For example, specialty pharmacy represents a significant and growing proportion of prescription drug spending in the United States, a significant portion of which is dispensed outside of traditional retail pharmacies. Because our specialty pharmacy business focuses on complex and high-cost medications, many of which are made available by manufacturers to a limited number of pharmacies (so-called limited distribution drugs), that serve a relatively limited universe of patients, the future growth of this business depends to a significant extent upon expanding our ability to access key drugs and successfully penetrate key treatment categories. To better serve this evolving market, on March 31, 2017, we and Prime Therapeutics LLC, a PBM, closed a transaction to form a combined central specialty pharmacy and mail services company, AllianceRx Walgreens Prime, using an innovative model that seeks to align pharmacy, PBM and health plans to coordinate patient care, improve health outcomes and deliver cost of care opportunities. If this joint venture does not successfully implement its model or is not able to compete effectively in this evolving market, our business operations, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. If we do not successfully develop and maintain a relevant omni-channel experience for our customers, our businesses and results of operations could be adversely impacted. - 16 - Our business has evolved from an in-store experience to interaction with customers across numerous channels, including in-store, online, mobile and social media, among others. Omni-channel retailing is rapidly evolving and we must keep pace with changing customer expectations and new developments by our competitors. Our customers are increasingly using computers, tablets, mobile phones, and other devices to comparison shop, determine product availability and complete purchases, as well as to provide immediate public reactions regarding various facets of our operations. We must compete by offering a consistent and convenient shopping experience for our customers regardless of the ultimate sales channel and by investing in, providing and maintaining digital tools for our customers that have the right features and are reliable and easy to use. If we are unable to make, improve, or develop relevant customer-facing technology in a timely manner that keeps pace with technological developments and dynamic customer expectations, our ability to compete and our results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. In addition, if our online activities or our other customer-facing technology systems do not function as designed, we may experience a loss of customer confidence, data security breaches, lost sales, or be exposed to fraudulent purchases, any of which could materially and adversely affect our business operations, reputation and results of operations. If the merchandise and services that we offer fail to meet customer needs, our sales may be adversely affected. We could be adversely affected by changes in consumer spending levels and shopping habits and preferences, including attitudes towards our retail and product brands. The success of our retail pharmacy businesses depends on our ability to offer a superior shopping experience, engaging customer service and a quality assortment of available merchandise that differentiates us from other retailers, including enhanced health and beauty product offerings. We must identify, obtain supplies of, and offer to our customers attractive, innovative and high-quality merchandise on a continuous basis. Our products and services must satisfy the needs and desires of our customers, whose preferences may change in the future. It is difficult to predict consistently and successfully the products and services our customers will demand. If we misjudge either the demand for products and services we sell or our customers purchasing habits and tastes, we may be faced with excess inventories of some products and missed opportunities for products and services we chose not to offer. In addition, our sales may decline or we may be required to sell the merchandise we have obtained at lower prices. Failure to timely identify or effectively respond to changing consumer tastes, preferences and spending patterns and evolving demographic mixes in the markets we serve could negatively affect our relationship with our customers and the demand for our products and services, which could materially and adversely impact our results of operations. Our private brand offerings expose us to various additional risks. In addition to brand name products, we offer our customers private brand products that are not available from other retailers. We seek to continue to grow our exclusive private brand offerings as part of our growth strategy, including through the expanded offering of No7 and other brands owned or licensed on an exclusive basis, as well as through selective acquisitions. Maintaining consistent product quality, competitive pricing, and availability of our private brand offerings for our customers, as well as the timely development and introduction of new products, is important in differentiating us from other retailers and developing and maintaining customer loyalty. Although we believe that our private brand products offer value to our customers and typically provide us with higher gross margins than comparable national brand products we sell, the expansion of our private brand offerings also subjects us to additional risks, such as potential product liability risks and mandatory or voluntary product recalls; our ability to successfully protect our proprietary rights and successfully navigate and avoid claims related to the proprietary rights of third parties; our ability to successfully administer and comply with applicable contractual obligations and regulatory requirements; and other risks generally encountered by entities that source, sell and market exclusive branded offerings for retail. An increase in sales of our private brands may also adversely affect sales of our vendors products, which, in turn, could adversely affect our relationship with certain of our vendors. Any failure to adequately address some or all of these risks could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, business operations, results of operations and financial condition. We may experience a significant disruption in our computer systems. We rely extensively on our computer systems to manage our ordering, pricing, point-of-sale, pharmacy fulfillment, inventory replenishment, customer loyalty programs, finance and other processes. Our systems are subject to damage or interruption from power outages, facility damage, computer and telecommunications failures, computer viruses, security breaches including credit card or personally identifiable information breaches, vandalism, natural disasters, catastrophic events, human error and potential cyber threats, including malicious codes, worms, phishing attacks, denial of service attacks, ransomware and other sophisticated cyber attacks, and our disaster recovery planning cannot account for all eventualities. If any of our systems are damaged, fail to function properly or otherwise become unavailable, we may incur substantial costs to repair or replace them, and may experience loss or corruption of critical data and interruptions or disruptions and delays in our ability to perform critical functions, which could materially and adversely affect our businesses and results of operations. In addition, we are currently making, and expect to continue to make, substantial investments in our information technology systems and - 17 - infrastructure, some of which are significant. Upgrades involve replacing existing systems with successor systems, making changes to existing systems, or cost-effectively acquiring new systems with new functionality. Implementing new systems carries significant potential risks, including failure to operate as designed, potential loss or corruption of data or information, cost overruns, implementation delays, disruption of operations, and the potential inability to meet business and reporting requirements. While we are aware of inherent risks associated with replacing these systems and believe we are taking reasonable action to mitigate known risks, there can be no assurance that we will not experience significant issues with our existing systems prior to implementation, that our technology initiatives will be successfully deployed as planned or that they will be timely implemented without significant disruption to our operations. We also could be adversely affected by any significant disruption in the systems of third parties we interact with, including key payers and vendors. If we or the businesses we interact with do not maintain the privacy and security of sensitive customer and business information, it could damage our reputation and we could suffer a loss of revenue, incur substantial additional costs and become subject to litigation and regulatory scrutiny. The protection of customer, employee, and company data is critical to our businesses. Cybersecurity and other information technology security risks, such as a significant breach of customer, employee, or company data, could attract a substantial amount of media attention, damage our customer relationships and reputation, and result in lost sales, fines or lawsuits. Throughout our operations, we receive, retain and transmit certain personal information that our customers and others provide to purchase products or services, fill prescriptions, enroll in promotional programs, participate in our customer loyalty programs, register on our websites, or otherwise communicate and interact with us. In addition, aspects of our operations depend upon the secure transmission of confidential information over public networks. Although we deploy a layered approach to address information security threats and vulnerabilities designed to protect confidential information against data security breaches, a compromise of our data security systems or of those of businesses with whom we interact, which results in confidential information being accessed, obtained, damaged or used by unauthorized or improper persons, could harm our reputation and expose us to regulatory actions and claims from customers, financial institutions, payment card associations and other persons, any of which could materially and adversely affect our business operations, financial condition and results of operations. Because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access, disable or degrade service, or sabotage systems change frequently and may not immediately produce signs of intrusion, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures. In addition, a security breach could require that we expend substantial additional resources related to the security of information systems and disrupt our businesses. The regulatory environment surrounding information security and privacy is increasingly demanding, with the frequent imposition of new and changing requirements across businesses. We are required to comply with increasingly complex and changing data privacy regulations in the United States and in other countries in which we operate that regulate the collection, use and transfer of personal data, including the transfer of personal data between or among countries. Some foreign data privacy regulations are more stringent than those in the United States and continue to change. For example, in May 2018, the General Data Protection Regulation will supersede current European Union data protection legislation, impose more stringent European Union data protection requirements, and provide for greater penalties for noncompliance. Complying with these and other changing requirements could cause us to incur substantial costs and require us to change our business practices in certain jurisdictions, any of which could materially adversely affect our business operations and operating results. We may also face audits or investigations by one or more domestic or foreign government agencies relating to our compliance with these regulations. Compliance with changes in privacy and information security laws and standards may result in significant expense due to increased investment in technology and the development of new operational processes. If we or those with whom we share information fail to comply with these laws and regulations or experience a data security breach, our reputation could be damaged and we could be subject to additional litigation and regulatory risks. Our security measures may be undermined due to the actions of outside parties, employee error, malfeasance, or otherwise, and, as a result, an unauthorized party may obtain access to our data systems and misappropriate business and personal information. Any such breach or unauthorized access could result in significant legal and financial exposure, damage to our reputation, and potentially have a material adverse effect on our business operations, financial condition and results of operations. We are subject to payment-related risks that could increase our operating costs, expose us to fraud or theft, subject us to potential liability and potentially disrupt our business operations. We accept payments using a variety of methods, including cash, checks, credit and debit cards, gift cards and mobile payment technologies such as Apple Pay, and we may offer new payment options over time. Acceptance of these payment options subjects us to rules, regulations, contractual obligations and compliance requirements, including payment network rules and operating guidelines, data security standards and certification requirements, and rules governing electronic funds transfers. These requirements and related interpretations may change over time, which could make compliance more difficult or costly. For certain payment methods, including credit and debit cards, we pay interchange and other fees, which could increase over - 18 - time and raise our operating costs. We rely on third parties to provide payment processing services, including the processing of credit cards, debit cards, and other forms of electronic payment. If these companies become unable to provide these services to us, or if their systems are compromised, it could disrupt our business. The payment methods that we offer also subject us to potential fraud and theft by persons who seek to obtain unauthorized access to or exploit any weaknesses that may exist in the payment systems. If we fail to comply with applicable rules or requirements, or if data is compromised due to a breach or misuse of data relating to our payment systems, we may be liable for costs incurred by payment card issuing banks and other third parties or subject to fines and higher transaction fees, or our ability to accept or facilitate certain types of payments could be impaired. In addition, our reputation could suffer and our customers could lose confidence in certain payment types, which could result in higher costs and/or reduced sales and materially and adversely affect our results of operations. Changes in healthcare regulatory environments may adversely affect our businesses. Political, economic and regulatory influences are subjecting the healthcare industry to significant changes that could adversely affect our results of operations. In recent years, the healthcare industry has undergone significant changes in an effort to reduce costs and government spending. These changes include an increased reliance on managed care; cuts in certain Medicare and Medicaid funding in the United States and the funding of governmental payers in foreign jurisdictions; consolidation of competitors, suppliers and other market participants; and the development of large, sophisticated purchasing groups. We expect the healthcare industry to continue to change significantly in the future. Some of these potential changes, such as a reduction in governmental funding for certain healthcare services or adverse changes in legislation or regulations governing prescription drug pricing, healthcare services or mandated benefits, may cause customers to reduce the amount of our products and services they purchase or the price they are willing to pay for our products and services. We expect continued governmental and private payer pressure to reduce pharmaceutical pricing. Changes in pharmaceutical manufacturers pricing or distribution policies could also significantly reduce our profitability. In the United States, the results of the November 2016 elections have generated uncertainty with respect to, and could result in, significant changes in legislation, regulation and government policy that could significantly impact our businesses and the health care and retail industries. There have been multiple attempts to repeal, amend or otherwise invalidate all, or certain provisions of, the ACA, which was enacted in 2010 to provide health insurance coverage to millions of previously uninsured Americans through a combination of insurance market reforms, an expansion of Medicaid, subsidies and health insurance mandates. Even if the ACA remains in effect, significant provisions of ACA have not yet been finalized (e.g., nondiscrimination in health programs and activities and the excise tax on high-cost employer-sponsored health coverage) and it is uncertain whether or in what form these provisions will be finalized. We cannot predict whether current or future efforts to repeal, amend or otherwise invalidate these laws and adopt new healthcare legislation will be successful, nor can we predict the impact that such a development would have on our business and operating results. Future legislation or rulemaking or other regulatory actions or developments under the ACA or otherwise could adversely impact the number of Americans with health insurance and, consequently, prescription drug coverage, increase regulation of pharmacy services, result in changes to pharmacy reimbursement rates, and otherwise change the way we do business. We cannot predict the timing or impact of any future legislative, rulemaking or other regulatory actions, but any such actions could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations. A significant change in, or noncompliance with, governmental regulations and other legal requirements could have a material adverse effect on our reputation and profitability. We operate in complex, highly regulated environments in the United States and in the other countries in which we operate and could be adversely affected by changes to existing legal requirements including the related interpretations and enforcement practices, new legal requirements and/or any failure to comply with applicable regulations. Businesses in our Pharmaceutical Wholesale division are subject to a range of regulations relating to such things as product margins, product traceability and the conditions under which products must be stored. Our retail pharmacy and health and wellness services businesses are subject to numerous country, state and local regulations including licensing and other requirements for pharmacies and reimbursement arrangements. The regulations to which we are subject include, but are not limited to: country and state registration and regulation of pharmacies and drug discount card programs; dispensing and sale of controlled substances and products containing pseudoephedrine; applicable governmental payer regulations including Medicare and Medicaid; data privacy and security laws and regulations including HIPAA; the ACA or any successor thereto; laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment and health and safety matters, including those governing exposure to, and the management and disposal of, hazardous substances; regulations regarding food and drug safety including those of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), trade regulations including those of the U.S. Federal Trade Commission, and consumer protection and safety regulations including those of the Consumer Product Safety Commission, as well as state regulatory authorities, governing the availability, sale, advertisement and promotion of products we sell as well as our loyalty and drug discount card programs; anti-kickback laws; false claims laws; laws against the - 19 - corporate practice of medicine; and foreign, national and state laws governing health care fraud and abuse and the practice of the profession of pharmacy. For example, in the United States the DEA, FDA and various other regulatory authorities regulate the distribution and dispensing of pharmaceuticals and controlled substances. We are required to hold valid DEA and state-level licenses, meet various security and operating standards and comply with the federal and various state controlled substance acts and related regulations governing the sale, dispensing, disposal, holding and distribution of controlled substances. The DEA, FDA and state regulatory authorities have broad enforcement powers, including the ability to seize or recall products and impose significant criminal, civil and administrative sanctions for violations of these laws and regulations. We are also governed by foreign, national and state laws of general applicability, including laws regulating matters of working conditions, health and safety and equal employment opportunity and other labor and employment matters as well as employee benefit, competition and antitrust matters. In addition, we could have significant exposure if we are found to have infringed another partys intellectual property rights. Changes in laws, regulations and policies and the related interpretations and enforcement practices may alter the landscape in which we do business and may significantly affect our cost of doing business. The impact of new laws, regulations and policies and the related interpretations and enforcement practices generally cannot be predicted, and changes in applicable laws, regulations and policies and the related interpretations and enforcement practices may require extensive system and operational changes, be difficult to implement, increase our operating costs and require significant capital expenditures. Untimely compliance or noncompliance with applicable laws and regulations could result in the imposition of civil and criminal penalties that could adversely affect the continued operation of our businesses, including: suspension of payments from government programs; loss of required government certifications; loss of authorizations to participate in or exclusion from government programs, including the Medicare and Medicaid programs in the United States and the National Health Service in the United Kingdom; loss of licenses; and significant fines or monetary penalties. Any failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements in the United States or in any of the countries in which we operate could result in significant legal and financial exposure, damage our reputation, and have a material adverse effect on our business operations, financial condition and results of operations. We could be adversely affected by product liability, product recall, personal injury or other health and safety issues. We could be adversely impacted by the supply of defective or expired products, including the infiltration of counterfeit products into the supply chain, errors in re-labelling of products, product tampering, product recall and contamination or product mishandling issues. Through our pharmacies and specialist packaging sites, we are also exposed to risks relating to the services we provide. Errors in the dispensing and packaging of pharmaceuticals, including related counseling, and in the provision of other healthcare services could lead to serious injury or death. Product liability or personal injury claims may be asserted against us with respect to any of the products or pharmaceuticals we sell or services we provide. Our healthcare clinics also increase our exposure to professional liability claims related to medical care. Should a product or other liability issue arise, the coverage limits under our insurance programs and the indemnification amounts available to us may not be adequate to protect us against claims and judgments. We also may not be able to maintain this insurance on acceptable terms in the future. We could suffer significant reputational damage and financial liability if we, or any affiliated entities, experience any of the foregoing health and safety issues or incidents, which could have a material adverse effect on our business operations, financial condition and results of operations. We have significant outstanding debt; our debt and associated payment obligations could significantly increase in the future if we incur additional debt and do not retire existing debt. We have outstanding debt and other financial obligations and significant unused borrowing capacity. As of August 31, 2017, we had approximately $13 billion of outstanding indebtedness, including short-term borrowings. Our debt level and related debt service obligations could have negative consequences, including: ##TABLE_START  requiring us to dedicate significant cash flow from operations to the payment of principal, interest and other amounts payable on our debt, which would reduce the funds we have available for other purposes, such as working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, share repurchases and dividends; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  making it more difficult or expensive for us to obtain any necessary future financing for working capital, capital expenditures, debt service requirements, debt refinancing, acquisitions or other purposes; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  reducing our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our industry and market conditions; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  making us more vulnerable in the event of a downturn in our business operations; and ##TABLE_END - 20 - ##TABLE_START  exposing us to interest rate risk given that a portion of our debt obligations is at variable interest rates. ##TABLE_END We may incur or assume significantly more debt in the future, including in connection with acquisitions, strategic investments or joint ventures. If we add new debt and do not retire existing debt, the risks described above could increase. We also could be adversely impacted by any failure to renew or replace, on terms acceptable to us or at all, existing funding arrangements when they expire, and any failure to satisfy applicable covenants. Our long-term debt obligations include covenants that may adversely affect our ability, and the ability of certain of our subsidiaries, to incur certain secured indebtedness or engage in certain types of transactions. In addition, our existing credit agreements require us to maintain as of the last day of each fiscal quarter a ratio of consolidated debt to total capitalization not to exceed a certain level. Our ability to comply with these restrictions and covenants may be affected by events beyond our control. If we breach any of these restrictions or covenants and do not obtain a waiver from the lenders, then, subject to applicable cure periods, our outstanding indebtedness could be declared immediately due and payable. This could have a material adverse effect on our business operations and financial condition. We could be adversely affected by downgrades to our credit ratings or disruptions in our ability to access well-functioning capital markets. Historically, we have relied on the public debt capital markets to fund portions of our capital investments and access to the commercial paper market and bank credit facilities as part of our working capital management strategy. Our continued access to these markets, and the terms of such access, depend on multiple factors including the condition of debt capital markets, our operating performance, and our credit ratings. The major credit rating agencies have assigned us and our corporate debt investment grade credit ratings. These ratings are based on a number of factors, which include their assessment of our financial strength and financial policies. We benefit from investment grade ratings as they serve to lower our borrowing costs and facilitate our access to a variety of lenders and other creditors, including landlords for our leased stores, on terms that we consider advantageous to our businesses. However, there can be no assurance that any particular rating assigned to us will remain in effect for any given period of time or that a rating will not be changed or withdrawn by a rating agency, if in that rating agencys judgment, future circumstances relating to the basis of the rating so warrant. Incurrence of additional debt by us could adversely affect our credit ratings. We depend on banks and other financial institutions to provide credit to our business and perform under our agreements with them. Defaults by one or more of these counterparties on their obligations to us could materially and adversely affect us. Any disruptions or turmoil in the capital markets or any downgrade of our credit ratings could adversely affect our cost of funds, liquidity, competitive position and access to capital markets and increase the cost of and counterparty risks associated with existing facilities, which could materially and adversely affect our business operations, financial condition, and results of operations. We may be unable to keep existing store locations or open new locations in desirable places on favorable terms, which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations. We compete with other retailers and businesses for suitable locations for our stores. Local land use and zoning regulations, environmental regulations and other regulatory requirements may impact our ability to find suitable locations and influence the cost of constructing, renovating and operating our stores. In addition, real estate, zoning, construction and other delays may adversely affect store openings and renovations and increase our costs. Further, changing local demographics at existing store locations may adversely affect revenue and profitability levels at those stores. The termination or expiration of leases at existing store locations may adversely affect us if the renewal terms of those leases are unacceptable to us and we are forced to close or relocate stores. If we determine to close or relocate a store subject to a lease, we may remain obligated under the applicable lease for the balance of the lease term. If we are unable to maintain our existing store locations or open new locations in desirable places and on favorable terms, our results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. As a holding company, Walgreens Boots Alliance is dependent on funding from its operating subsidiaries to pay dividends and other obligations. Walgreens Boots Alliance is a holding company with no business operations of its own. Its assets primarily consist of direct and indirect ownership interests in, and its business is conducted through, subsidiaries which are separate legal entities. As a result, it is dependent on funding from its subsidiaries, including Walgreens and Alliance Boots, to meet its obligations. Additionally, Walgreens Boots Alliances subsidiaries may be restricted in their ability to pay cash dividends or to make other distributions to Walgreens Boots Alliance, which may limit the payment of cash dividends or other distributions to the holders of Walgreens Boots Alliance common stock. Credit facilities and other debt obligations of Walgreens Boots Alliance, as well as statutory provisions, may further limit the ability of Walgreens Boots Alliance and its subsidiaries to pay dividends. Payments to Walgreens Boots Alliance by its subsidiaries are also contingent upon its subsidiaries earnings and business considerations. - 21 - Our quarterly results may fluctuate significantly. Our operating results have historically varied on a quarterly basis and may continue to fluctuate significantly in the future. Factors that may affect our quarterly operating results, some of which are beyond the control of management, include, but are not limited to the timing of the introduction of new generic and brand name prescription drugs; inflation, including with respect to generic drug procurement costs; the timing and severity of the cough, cold and flu season; changes in payer reimbursement rates and terms; fluctuations in inventory, energy, transportation, labor, healthcare and other costs; significant acquisitions, dispositions, joint ventures and other strategic initiatives; asset impairment charges; the relative magnitude of our LIFO provision in any particular quarter; foreign currency fluctuations; seasonality; prolonged severe weather in key markets; and many of the other risk factors discussed herein. Accordingly, we believe that quarter-to-quarter comparisons of our operating results are not necessarily meaningful and investors should not rely on the results of any particular quarter as an indication of our future performance. Our businesses are seasonal in nature, and adverse events during the holiday and cough, cold and flu seasons could adversely impact our operating results. Our businesses are seasonal in nature, with the second fiscal quarter (December, January and February) typically generating a higher proportion of retail sales and earnings than other fiscal quarters. We purchase significant amounts of seasonal inventory in anticipation of the holiday season. Adverse events, such as deteriorating economic conditions, higher unemployment, higher gas prices, public transportation disruptions, or unanticipated adverse weather, could result in lower-than-planned sales during key selling seasons. For example, frequent or unusually heavy snowfall, ice storms, rainstorms, windstorms or other extreme weather conditions over a prolonged period could make it difficult for our customers to travel to our stores and increase our snow removal and other costs. This could lead to lower sales or to unanticipated markdowns, negatively impacting our financial condition and results of operations. In addition, both prescription and non-prescription drug sales are affected by the timing and severity of the cough, cold and flu season, which can vary considerably from year to year. We could be adversely impacted by changes in accounting standards and subjective assumptions, estimates and judgments by management related to complex accounting matters. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) and related accounting pronouncements, implementation guidelines and interpretations with regard to a wide range of matters that are relevant to our businesses, including, but not limited to, revenue recognition, asset impairment, impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets, inventories, equity method investments, vendor rebates and other vendor consideration, lease obligations, self-insurance liabilities, pension and postretirement benefits, tax matters, unclaimed property laws and litigation and other contingent liabilities are highly complex and involve many subjective assumptions, estimates and judgments. Changes in these rules or their interpretation or changes in underlying assumptions, estimates or judgments could significantly change our reported or expected financial performance or financial condition. For example, changes in accounting standards and the application of existing accounting standards particularly related to the measurement of fair value as compared to carrying value for the Companys reporting units, including goodwill, intangible assets and investments in equity interests, including investments held by our equity method investees, may have an adverse effect on the Companys financial condition and results of operations. Factors that could lead to impairment of goodwill and intangible assets include significant adverse changes in the business climate and declines in the financial condition of a reporting unit. Factors that could lead to impairment of investments in equity interests of the companies in which we invested or the investments held by those companies include a prolonged period of decline in their operating performance or adverse changes in the economic, regulatory and legal environments of the countries in which they operate in. New accounting guidance also may require systems and other changes that could increase our operating costs and/or significantly change our financial statements. For example, in February 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842), which supersedes Topic 840, Leases. This ASU, which is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2018 (fiscal 2020), seeks to increase the transparency and comparability of organizations by recognizing operating lease assets and operating lease liabilities on the balance sheet and disclosing key information about leasing arrangements. See, new accounting pronouncements, within note 2, summary of major accounting policies to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Implementing this ASU, as well as other new accounting guidance may require us to make significant upgrades to and investments in our lease administration systems and other accounting systems, and could result in significant adverse changes to our financial statements. We have a substantial amount of goodwill and other intangible assets which could, in the future, become impaired and result in material non-cash charges to our results of operations. - 22 - As of August 31, 2017, we had $25.8 billion of goodwill and other intangible assets. We evaluate this goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment annually during the fourth quarter, or more frequently if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value. As part of this impairment analysis, we determine fair value for each reporting unit using both the income and market approaches. Definite-lived intangible assets are evaluated for impairment if an event occurs or circumstances change that indicate the carrying amount may not be recoverable. Estimated fair values could change if, for example, there are changes in the business climate, changes in the competitive environment, adverse legal or regulatory actions or developments, changes in capital structure, cost of debt, interest rates, capital expenditure levels, operating cash flows, or market capitalization. Because of the significance of our goodwill and intangible assets, any future impairment of these assets could require material non-cash charges to our results of operations, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. We are exposed to risks related to litigation and other legal proceedings. We operate in a highly regulated and litigious environment. We are involved in litigation, arbitration and other legal proceedings and subject to investigations, inspections, audits, inquiries and similar actions by governmental authorities arising in the course of our businesses, including those contained in note 11, commitments and contingencies to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in part II, item 8 of this Form 10-K. Legal proceedings, in general, and securities and class action litigation, in particular, can be expensive and disruptive. Some of these suits may purport or may be determined to be class actions and/or involve parties seeking large and/or indeterminate amounts, including punitive or exemplary damages, and may remain unresolved for several years. In addition, under the qui tam or whistleblower provisions of the federal and various state false claims acts, persons may bring lawsuits alleging that a violation of the federal anti-kickback statute or similar laws has resulted in the submission of false claims to federal and/or state healthcare programs, including Medicare and Medicaid. From time to time, we are also involved in legal proceedings as a plaintiff involving antitrust, tax, contract, intellectual property and other matters. We cannot predict with certainty the outcomes of these legal proceedings and other contingencies, and the costs incurred in litigation can be substantial, regardless of the outcome. Substantial unanticipated verdicts, fines and rulings do sometimes occur. As a result, we could from time to time incur judgments, enter into settlements or revise our expectations regarding the outcome of certain matters, and such developments could harm our reputation and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in the period in which the amounts are accrued and/or our cash flows in the period in which the amounts are paid. The outcome of some of these legal proceedings and other contingencies could require us to take, or refrain from taking, actions which could negatively affect our operations. Additionally, defending against these lawsuits and proceedings may involve significant expense and diversion of managements attention and resources. We could be adversely affected by violations of anti-bribery, anti-corruption and/or international trade laws. We are subject to laws concerning our business operations and marketing activities in foreign countries where we conduct business. For example, we are subject to the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (the FCPA), U.S. export control, anti-money laundering and trade sanction laws, and similar anti-corruption and international trade laws in certain foreign countries, such as the U.K. Bribery Act, any violation of which could create substantial liability for us and also harm our reputation. The FCPA generally prohibits U.S. companies and their officers, directors, employees, and intermediaries from making improper payments to foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business abroad or otherwise obtaining favorable treatment. The FCPA also requires that U.S. public companies maintain books and records that fairly and accurately reflect transactions and maintain an adequate system of internal accounting controls. If we are found to have violated the FCPA, or any other anti-bribery, anti-corruption or international trade laws, we may face sanctions including civil and criminal fines, disgorgement of profits, and suspension or debarment of our ability to contract with governmental agencies or receive export licenses. In addition, new initiatives may be proposed from time to time that impact the trading conditions in certain countries or regions, and may include retaliatory duties or trade sanctions which, if enacted, could adversely impact our trading relationships with vendors or other parties in such locations and have a material adverse effect on our operations. From time to time, we may face audits or investigations by one or more domestic or foreign governmental agencies relating to our international business activities, compliance with which could be costly and time-consuming, and could divert our management and key personnel from our business operations. An adverse outcome under any such investigation or audit could damage our reputation and subject us to fines or other penalties, which could materially and adversely affect our business operations, financial condition, and results of operations. We could be subject to adverse changes in tax laws, regulations and interpretations or challenges to our tax positions. We are a large corporation with operations in the United States and numerous other jurisdictions around the world. As such, we are subject to tax laws and regulations of the United States federal, state and local governments as well as various foreign jurisdictions. We compute our income tax provision based on enacted tax rates in the jurisdictions in which we operate. As the - 23 - tax rates vary among jurisdictions, a change in earnings attributable to the various jurisdictions in which we operate could result in an unfavorable change in our overall tax provision. Any changes in corporate income tax laws or any implementation of tax laws relating to corporate tax reform, could significantly impact our overall tax liability. From time to time, legislative and regulatory initiatives are proposed that could adversely affect our tax positions, effective tax rate, tax payments or financial condition. In addition, tax laws and regulations are complex and subject to varying interpretations and any significant failure to comply with applicable tax laws and regulations in all relevant jurisdictions could give rise to substantial penalties and liabilities. Any change in enacted tax laws, rules or regulatory or judicial interpretations, any adverse outcome in connection with tax audits in any jurisdiction or any change in the pronouncements relating to accounting for income taxes could materially and adversely affect our effective tax rate, tax payments and results of operations. Our insurance strategies may expose us to unexpected costs. We use a combination of insurance and self-insurance to provide for potential liability for workers compensation; automobile and general liability; property, director and officers liability; and employee healthcare benefits. Provisions for losses related to self-insured risks generally are based upon actuarially determined estimates. Any actuarial projection of losses is subject to a high degree of variability. Substantial, unanticipated losses or liabilities, including those due to natural disasters or otherwise, as well as changes in legal claims, trends and interpretations, variability in inflation rates, changes in the nature and method of claims settlement, benefit level changes due to changes in applicable laws, insolvency of insurance carriers, and changes in discount rates could all materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. We could be adversely impacted by changes in assumptions used in calculating pension assets and liabilities. We operate certain defined benefit pension plans in the United Kingdom, which were closed to new entrants in 2010, as well as smaller plans in other jurisdictions. The valuation of the pension plans assets and liabilities depends in part on assumptions, which are primarily based on the financial markets as well as longevity and employee retention rates. This valuation is particularly sensitive to material changes in the value of equity, bond and other investments held by the pension plans, changes in the corporate bond yields which are used in the measurement of the liabilities, changes in market expectations for long-term price inflation, and new evidence on projected longevity rates. Funding requirements and the impact on the statement of earnings relating to these pension plans are also influenced by these factors. Adverse changes in the assumptions used to calculate the value of pension assets and liabilities, including lower than expected pension fund investment returns and/or increased life expectancy of plan participants, or regulatory change could require us to increase the funding of its defined benefit pension plans or incur higher expenses, which would adversely impact our results of operations and financial position. Certain stockholders may have significant voting influence over matters requiring stockholder approval. As of August 31, 2017, affiliates of Stefano Pessina, our Executive Vice Chairman and Chief Executive Officer (the SP Investors), had sole or shared voting power, directly or indirectly, over an aggregate of approximately 14% of our outstanding common stock. The SP Investors have agreed to, for so long as they have the right to designate a nominee for election to the Board, to vote all of their shares of common stock in accordance with the Boards recommendation on matters submitted to a vote of the Companys stockholders (including with respect to the election of directors). The SP Investors significant interest in our common stock potentially could determine the outcome of matters submitted to a vote by our stockholders. The influence of the SP Investors could result in the Company taking actions that other stockholders do not support or failing to take actions that other stockholders support. As a result, the market price of our common stock could be adversely affected. Shares issued to former Alliance Boots stockholders in connection with our strategic combination with Alliance Boots are eligible for future sale. The shares issued to the SP Investors and certain other former Alliance Boots stockholders in connection with our strategic combination with Alliance Boots generally may now be sold pursuant to Rule 144 under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act), subject to restrictions in the case of shares held by persons deemed to be our affiliates and to certain obligations pursuant to a shareholders agreement (as amended, the Company Shareholders Agreement) with certain of the SP Investors. In addition, the Company Shareholders Agreement also contains registration rights that would obligate us, in certain instances, to file future registration statements under the Securities Act covering resales of shares issued to former Alliance Boots stockholders or to permit a piggyback on a future registration statement. A sale, or the perception that a sale may occur, of a substantial number of shares of our common stock could adversely impact the market price of our common stock. Conflicts of interest, or the appearance of conflicts of interest, may arise because certain of our directors and officers are also owners or directors of companies we may have dealings with. - 24 - Conflicts of interest, or the appearance of conflicts of interest, could arise between our interests and the interests of the other entities and business activities in which our directors or officers are involved. For example, potential conflicts of interest could arise if a dispute were to arise between the Company and other parties to the Company Shareholders Agreement, including the SP Investors. Mr. Pessina, our Executive Vice Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, indirectly controls Alliance Sant Participations S.A. (ASP), a privately-held company which is a party to the Company Shareholders Agreement, and he and his partner Ornella Barra, our Co-Chief Operating Officer, serve as directors of ASP. Similar issues could arise in connection with other transactions in the future. While our contractual arrangements place restrictions on the parties conduct in certain situations, and related party transactions are subject to independent review and approval in accordance with our related party transaction approval procedures and applicable law, the potential for a conflict of interest exists and such persons may have conflicts of interest, or the appearance of conflicts of interest, with respect to matters involving or affecting both companies. Our certificate of incorporation and bylaws, Delaware law and/or our agreements with certain stockholders may impede the ability of our stockholders to make changes to our Board or impede a takeover. Certain provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws, as well as provisions of the Delaware General Corporation Law (the DGCL), could make it difficult for stockholders to change the composition of the Board or discourage, delay, or prevent a merger, consolidation, or acquisitions that stockholders may otherwise consider favorable. These provisions include the authorization of the issuance of blank check preferred stock that could be issued by the Board, limitations on the ability of stockholders to call special meetings, and advance notice requirements for nomination for election to the Board or for proposing matters that can be acted upon by stockholders at stockholder meetings. We are also subject to the provisions of Section 203 of the DGCL, which prohibits us, except under specified circumstances, from engaging in any mergers, significant sales of stock or assets, or business combinations with any stockholder or group of stockholders who own 15% or more of our common stock. Under the Company Shareholders Agreement, the SP Investors are entitled to designate one nominee to the Board (currently Stefano Pessina) for so long as the SP Investors continue to meet certain beneficial ownership thresholds and subject to certain other conditions. Pursuant to the Company Shareholders Agreement, the SP Investors have agreed that, for so long as they have the right to designate a nominee to the Board, they will vote all of their shares of common stock in accordance with the Boards recommendation on matters submitted to a vote of our stockholders (including with respect to the election of directors). While these provisions do not make us immune from takeovers or changes in the composition of the Board, and are intended to protect our stockholders from, among other things, coercive or otherwise unfair tactics, these provisions could have the effect of making it difficult for stockholders to change the composition of the Board or discouraging, delaying, or preventing a merger, consolidation, or acquisitions that stockholders may otherwise consider favorable. See also the risk factor captioned Certain stockholders may have significant voting influence over matters requiring stockholder approval above. The market price of our common stock may be volatile. The market price of shares of our common stock may be volatile. Broad general economic, political, market and industry factors may adversely affect the market price of the shares, regardless of our actual operating performance. In addition to the other risk factors identified in this Item 1A, factors that could cause fluctuations in the price of the shares include: ##TABLE_START  actual or anticipated variations in quarterly operating results and the results of competitors; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  changes in financial estimates by us or by any securities analysts that might cover us; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  conditions or trends in the industry, including regulatory changes or changes in the securities marketplace; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  announcements by us or our competitors of significant acquisitions, strategic partnerships or divestitures; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  announcements of investigations or regulatory scrutiny of our operations or lawsuits filed against us; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  additions or departures of key personnel; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  issuances or sales of our common stock, including sales of shares by our directors and officers or key investors, including the SP Investors; and ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  various other market factors or perceived market factors, including rumors or speculation, whether or not correct, involving or affecting us or our industries, vendors, customers, strategic partners or competitors. ##TABLE_END- 25 - There are a number of additional business risks that could materially and adversely affect our businesses and financial results. Many other factors could materially and adversely affect our businesses and financial results, including: ##TABLE_START  If we are unsuccessful in establishing effective advertising, marketing and promotional programs, our sales or sales margins could be negatively affected. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  Our operating costs may be subject to increases outside the control of our businesses, whether due to inflation, new or increased taxes, adverse fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, changes in market conditions or otherwise. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  Our success depends on our ability to attract, engage and retain store, professional and management personnel, including in executive and other key strategic positions, and the loss of key personnel could have an adverse effect on the results of our operations, financial condition or cash flow. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  Natural disasters, civil unrest, severe weather conditions, terrorist activities, global political and economic developments, war, health epidemics or pandemics or the prospect of these events can interrupt or otherwise adversely impact our operations or damage our facilities or those of our strategic partners, vendors and customers and have an adverse impact on consumer confidence levels and spending on our products and services. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  If we or our affiliates were to incur significant liabilities or expense relating to the protection of the environment, related health and safety matters, environmental remediation or compliance with environmental laws and regulations, including those governing exposure to, and the management and disposal of, hazardous substances, it could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flow. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  The long-term effects of climate change on general economic conditions and the pharmacy industry in particular are unclear, and changes in the supply, demand or available sources of energy and the regulatory and other costs associated with energy production and delivery may affect the availability or cost of goods and services, including natural resources, necessary to run our businesses. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  If negative publicity, even if unwarranted, related to safety or quality, human and workplace rights, or other issues damage our brand image and corporate reputation, or that of our vendors or strategic allies, our businesses may suffer. ##TABLE_END  ", "1B": " Item 1B.

As a result, fiscal 2015 includes the results of Alliance Boots for eight months (January through August 2015) on a fully consolidated basis and four months (September through December 2014) as equity earnings in Alliance Boots reflecting Walgreens pre-merger 45% interest. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START 3  In fiscal 2015, as a result of acquiring the remaining 55% interest in Alliance Boots, our previously held 45% interest was remeasured to fair value, resulting in a gain of $563 million. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START 4  In fiscal 2016, 2015, 2014 and 2013, the Company recorded other income (expense) of $(517) million, $779 million, $385 million and $120 million, respectively, from fair value adjustments of the AmerisourceBergen warrants and the amortization of the deferred credit associated with the initial value of the warrants. Fiscal 2016 also includes income of $268 million related to the change in accounting method for our investment in AmerisourceBergen. Fiscal 2015 also includes a $94 million loss on derivative contracts that were not designated as accounting hedges.

Managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read together with the financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere herein and the description of the Companys business and reportable segments in Item 1 above. This discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results may differ materially from those discussed in forward-looking statements. Factors that might cause a difference include, but are not limited to, those discussed under cautionary note regarding forward-looking statements below and in risk factors in part I, item 1A of this Form 10-K. References herein to the Company, we, us, or our refer to Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. and its subsidiaries from and after the effective time of the Reorganization on December 31, 2014 and, prior to that time, to its predecessor Walgreen Co. and its subsidiaries, and in each case do not include unconsolidated partially-owned entities, except as otherwise indicated or the context otherwise requires. INTRODUCTION On March 31, 2017, Walgreens Boots Alliance and pharmacy benefit manager Prime Therapeutics LLC closed a transaction to form a combined central specialty pharmacy and mail services company, AllianceRx Walgreens Prime, as part of a strategic alliance. AllianceRx Walgreens Prime is consolidated by Walgreens Boots Alliance and reported within the Retail Pharmacy USA division in its financial statements. See note 6, acquisitions for further information. On December 31, 2014, Walgreens Boots Alliance became the successor of Walgreens pursuant to a merger to effect a reorganization of Walgreens into a holding company structure, with Walgreens Boots Alliance becoming the parent holding company. Pursuant to the Reorganization, Walgreens became a wholly owned subsidiary of Walgreens Boots Alliance, which was formed for the purposes of the Reorganization, and each issued and outstanding share of Walgreens common stock converted on a one-to-one basis into Walgreens Boots Alliance common stock. Also on December 31, 2014, following the completion of the Reorganization, Walgreens Boots Alliance completed the acquisition of the remaining 55% of Alliance Boots GmbH (Alliance Boots) that Walgreens did not previously own (the Second Step Transaction) in exchange for 3.133 billion in cash and 144.3 million shares of Walgreens Boots Alliance common stock. Alliance Boots became a consolidated subsidiary and ceased being accounted for under the equity method immediately upon completion of the Second Step Transaction. For financial reporting and accounting purposes, Walgreens Boots Alliance was the acquirer of Alliance Boots. The Consolidated Financial Statements (and other data, such as prescriptions filled) reflect the results of operations and financial position of Walgreens and its subsidiaries for periods prior to December 31, 2014 and of Walgreens Boots Alliance and its subsidiaries for periods from and after the effective time of the Reorganization on December 31, 2014.  In addition, we have undertaken a number of additional acquisitions, divestitures and strategic initiatives in recent years designed to grow our businesses and enhance our competitive position. Please refer to note 3, exit and disposal activities, note 5, equity method investments and note 6, acquisitions to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in part II, item 8 below for additional information. Terminated acquisition of Rite Aid Corporation (Rite Aid) and related matters On October 27, 2015, Walgreens Boots Alliance entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger with Rite Aid and Victoria Merger Sub, Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of Walgreens Boots Alliance (as amended as described below, the Merger Agreement), pursuant to which the Company agreed, subject to the terms and conditions thereof, to acquire Rite Aid, a drugstore chain in the United States. The Merger Agreement was amended by Amendment No. 1 thereto on January 29, 2017. In connection with regulatory review of the merger contemplated by the Merger Agreement, on December 20, 2016, Walgreens Boots Alliance and Rite Aid announced that they had entered into an agreement (the Freds Asset Purchase Agreement), subject to the terms and conditions thereof, to sell certain Rite Aid stores and certain assets related to store operations to Freds, Inc. (Freds) for $950 million in an all-cash transaction. The transaction was subject to the approval and completion of the acquisition of Rite Aid by Walgreens Boots Alliance pursuant to the Merger Agreement. On June 28, 2017, Walgreens Boots Alliance and Rite Aid entered into a mutual termination agreement (the Termination Agreement) pursuant to which the parties agreed to terminate the Merger Agreement, including all schedules and exhibits thereto, and all ancillary agreements contemplated thereby, or entered pursuant thereto (other than as expressly specified) (collectively with the Merger Agreement, the Transaction Documents), effective as of June 28, 2017. Pursuant to the Termination Agreement, the Company paid Rite Aid the termination fee of $325 million, in full satisfaction of any amounts required to be paid by the Company under the Merger Agreement and other Transaction Documents. The parties also agreed to release each other from, among other things, any and all liability, claims, rights, actions, causes of action, damages, expenses and fees, however arising, in connection with, arising out of or related to the Transaction Documents, the transactions contemplated therein or thereby or certain related matters. - 33 - On June 28, 2017, following the termination of the Merger Agreement, the Freds Asset Purchase Agreement was terminated. In connection with the termination of the Freds Asset Purchase Agreement, the Company reimbursed $25 million of Freds transaction costs in full satisfaction of any amounts required to be paid by the Company under the Freds Asset Purchase Agreement. See note 8, borrowings to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information relating to the termination of the Merger Agreement and related matters. Acquisition of certain Rite Aid assets On June 28, 2017, the Company entered into an asset purchase agreement (the Asset Purchase Agreement) with Rite Aid, pursuant to which the Company agreed, subject to the terms and conditions thereof, to acquire 2,186 stores, three distribution centers and related inventory from Rite Aid. On September 19, 2017, the Company announced it had secured regulatory clearance for an amended and restated asset purchase agreement (the Amended and Restated Asset Purchase Agreement) to purchase 1,932 stores, three distribution centers and related inventory from Rite Aid for $4.375 billion in cash and other consideration. As of the date of this report, the first few Rite Aid stores have been acquired. Ownership of stores is expected to be transferred in phases, with the goal being to complete the store transfers in spring 2018. These transfers remain subject to closing conditions set forth in the Amended and Restated Asset Purchase Agreement. The Company expects to complete integration of the acquired stores and related assets within the next three years, at an estimated cost of approximately $750 million, which will be reported as acquisition-related costs. In addition, the Company plans to spend approximately $500 million of capital on store conversions and related activities. The Company intends to treat charges related to acquisition integration activities as special items impacting comparability of results in its quarterly earnings disclosures. The Company expects to realize annual synergies from the transaction of more than $300 million, which are expected to be fully realized within four years of the initial closing of this transaction and derived primarily from procurement, cost savings and other operational matters. The amounts and timing of all estimates are subject to change until finalized. The actual amounts and timing may vary materially based on various factors. See cautionary note regarding forward-looking statements below. EXIT AND DISPOSAL ACTIVITIES Store Optimization Program On October 24, 2017, the Companys Board of Directors approved a plan to implement a program (the Store Optimization Program) as part of an initiative to optimize store locations within the Companys Retail Pharmacy USA division upon completion of the acquisition of certain stores and related assets from Rite Aid. The Store Optimization Program includes plans to close approximately 600 stores across the U.S. and is expected to result in cost savings of $300 million per year to be delivered by the end of fiscal 2020. The actions under the Store Optimization Program are expected to take place over an 18 month period beginning in spring 2018. The Company currently estimates that it will recognize cumulative pre-tax charges to its GAAP financial results of approximately $450 million, including costs associated with lease obligations and other real estate costs, employee severance and other exit costs. The Company expects to incur pre-tax charges of approximately $270 million for lease obligations and other real estate costs and approximately $180 million for employee severance and other exit costs. The Company estimates that substantially all of these cumulative pre-tax charges will result in future cash expenditures. As the Store Optimization Program is implemented, charges will be recognized as the costs are incurred over time in accordance with GAAP. The Company intends to treat charges related to the Store Optimization Program as special items impacting comparability of results in its quarterly earnings disclosures. The amounts and timing of all estimates are subject to change until finalized. The actual amounts and timing may vary materially based on various factors. See cautionary note regarding forward-looking statements below. Cost Transformation Program On April 8, 2015, the Walgreens Boots Alliance Board of Directors approved a plan to implement a restructuring program (the Cost Transformation Program) as part of an initiative to reduce costs and increase operating efficiencies. The Cost - 34 - Transformation Program implemented and built on the planned three-year, $1.0 billion cost-reduction initiative previously announced by Walgreens on August 6, 2014 and included a number of elements designed to help achieve profitable growth through increased cost efficiencies. In April 2015, the Company announced that it had identified additional opportunities for cost savings that increased the total expected cost savings of the Cost Transformation Program by $500 million to a targeted $1.5 billion by the end of fiscal 2017, with significant areas of focus including plans to close approximately 200 stores across the U.S.; reorganize divisional and field operations; drive operating efficiencies; and streamline information technology and other functions. The actions under the Cost Transformation Program focused primarily on our Retail Pharmacy USA segment. The Company achieved $1.5 billion in savings from its previously announced Cost Transformation Program ahead of schedule. As announced in the second quarter of fiscal 2017, the Company expected to close a total of approximately 260 stores. The Company completed the Cost Transformation Program in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017, and over the duration of the program, 255 stores were closed. Full program benefits will be recognized in subsequent periods. The Company recognized cumulative pre-tax charges to our financial results in accordance with GAAP of $1.8 billion . These charges included $743 million for asset impairment charges relating primarily to asset write-offs from store closures, information technology, inventory and other non-operational real estate asset write-offs; $665 million for real estate costs, including lease obligations (net of estimated sublease income); and $393 million for employee severance and other business transition and exit costs. The Company estimates that approximately 60% of the cumulative pre-tax charges will result in cash expenditures over time, primarily related to historical and future lease and other real estate payments and employee separation costs. See note 3, exit and disposal activities, to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. The amounts and timing of all estimates are subject to change until finalized. The actual amounts and timing may vary materially based on various factors. See cautionary note regarding forward-looking statements below. COMPARABILITY As a result of the completion of the Second Step Transaction on December 31, 2014, there are a number of items that affect comparability of reported results. Prior to December 31, 2014, our operations were within one reportable segment that included the results of the Retail Pharmacy USA division and corporate costs, along with the fully consolidated results of Walgreens Boots Alliance Development GmbH (WBAD), a global sourcing enterprise formed by Walgreens and Alliance Boots, and equity earnings from Alliance Boots. Following the completion of the Reorganization and the Second Step Transaction on December 31, 2014, we report results in three segments. Segmental reporting includes the allocation of procurement benefits, including WBADs results, and the combined corporate costs for periods subsequent to December 31, 2014. We have determined that it is impracticable to allocate historical results to the current segmental presentation. Accordingly, our Retail Pharmacy USA segment results for fiscal 2015 for months prior to December 31, 2014 include all corporate costs of Walgreens, the full consolidated results of WBAD and equity income from Walgreens pre-merger 45% interest in Alliance Boots. The completion of the Second Step Transaction on December 31, 2014 also means that results for the twelve month periods ended August 31,  2017 and 2016 include the results of Alliance Boots on a fully consolidated basis, while the twelve month period ended August 31, 2015 includes the results of Alliance Boots for eight months (January through August 2015) on a fully consolidated basis and as equity income from Walgreens pre-merger 45% interest in Alliance Boots for four months (September through December 2014). Twelve month period-over-period comparisons of results require consideration of the foregoing factors and are not directly comparable. In addition, our sales results are affected by a number of factors, including our sales performance during holiday periods and during the cough, cold and flu season; foreign currency fluctuations; significant weather conditions; timing of our own or competitor discount programs and pricing actions; levels of reimbursement from governmental agencies and other third party payers; and general economic conditions in the markets in which we operate. AMERISOURCEBERGEN CORPORATION RELATIONSHIP In March 2013, Walgreens, Alliance Boots and AmerisourceBergen announced various agreements and arrangements, including a ten-year pharmaceutical distribution agreement between Walgreens and AmerisourceBergen pursuant to which branded and generic pharmaceutical products are sourced from AmerisourceBergen in the United States and an agreement which provides AmerisourceBergen the ability to access generics pharmaceutical products through WBAD. In May 2016, certain of these agreements were extended for three years to now expire in 2026.  In addition, in March 2013, Walgreens, Alliance Boots and AmerisourceBergen entered into agreements and arrangements pursuant to which we have the right, but not the obligation, to purchase a minority equity position in AmerisourceBergen over time through open market purchases and pursuant to warrants to acquire AmerisourceBergen common stock and gain - 35 - associated representation on AmerisourceBergens Board of Directors in certain circumstances. Please refer to our Form 8-K filed on March 20, 2013 for more detailed information regarding these agreements and arrangements. On March 18, 2016, we exercised warrants to purchase 22,696,912 shares of AmerisourceBergen common stock at an exercise price of $51.50 per share for an aggregate exercise price payment of $1.17 billion. On August 25, 2016, we exercised additional warrants to purchase 22,696,912 shares of AmerisourceBergen common stock at an exercise price of $52.50 per share for an aggregate exercise price payment of $1.19 billion. As of August 31, 2017 , we owned 56,854,867 AmerisourceBergen common shares representing approximately 26% of the outstanding AmerisourceBergen common stock and had designated one member of AmerisourceBergens board of directors. As of August 31, 2017 , we can acquire up to an additional 8,398,752 AmerisourceBergen shares in the open market and thereafter designate another member of AmerisourceBergens board of directors, subject in each case to applicable legal and contractual requirements. The amount of permitted open market purchases is subject to increase or decrease in certain circumstances. Effective March 18, 2016, we began accounting for our investment in AmerisourceBergen using the equity method of accounting, subject to a two-month reporting lag, with the net earnings attributable to our investment being classified within the operating income of our Pharmaceutical Wholesale segment. See note 5, equity method investments, to the Consolidated Financial Statements included herein for further information. Due to the March 18, 2016 effective date and the two-month reporting lag, our results for the 12 month period ended August 31, 2016 include approximately three and a half months of equity method income relating to our investment in AmerisourceBergen. Similarly, our results for the 12 month period ended August 31, 2017 include approximately ten and a half months of equity income reflecting our increased ownership following the exercise on August 25, 2016 of the second tranche of warrants.  RECENT HURRICANES The Company currently estimates that it will recognize cumulative pre-tax charges to its fiscal 2018 GAAP financial results of approximately $90 million for the cost of storm damages and store closures. The majority of these charges will be incurred in Puerto Rico. The Company intends to treat these charges as special items impacting comparability of results in its quarterly earnings disclosures. The amounts and timing of all estimates are subject to change until finalized. The actual amounts and timing may vary materially based on various factors. See cautionary note regarding forward-looking statements below.

The decreases reflect Rite Aid related costs, the phasing of the Companys Cost Transformation Program and the impact in the prior year of the change in accounting method for our investment in AmerisourceBergen, largely offset by the reduction in the fair value of the Companys AmerisourceBergen warrants, improvements in selling, general and administration expenses before cost transformation expenses and a lower effective tax rate. Other expense for fiscal 2017 and fiscal 2016 was $11 million and $261 million , respectively. In fiscal 2016 the change in fair value of our AmerisourceBergen warrants resulted in a loss of $517 million, and additionally, we recognized income of $268 million related to the change in accounting method for our investment in AmerisourceBergen.  Interest was a net expense of $693 million and $596 million in fiscal 2017 and 2016 , respectively. The increase mainly reflects the prefunded acquisition financing costs relating to the Rite Aid transaction. The effective tax rate for fiscal 2017 and 2016 was 15.7% and 19.4% , respectively. The net decrease in the effective tax rate was primarily attributable to changes in the geographic mix of our pre-tax earnings, favorable changes in permanent differences between our financial statement earnings and taxable profits as well as incremental discrete tax benefits. Our mix of pre-tax earnings was notably impacted by our Cost Transformation Program and costs associated with the termination of the Rite Aid Merger Agreement, both of which reduced our U.S. pre-tax earnings. For fiscal 2017, net discrete tax benefits resulted primarily from deferred tax benefits related to a change in the U.K. tax rate, adopting ASU 2016-09 and net tax benefits associated with prior tax years. Adjusted diluted net earnings per share (Non-GAAP measure) fiscal 2017 compared to fiscal 2016  Adjusted net earnings attributable to Walgreens Boots Alliance in fiscal 2017  increase d 9.9 percent to $5.5 billion compared with the prior year. Adjusted diluted net earnings per share in fiscal 2017  increase d 11.1 percent to $5.10 compared with the prior year. Adjusted net earnings and adjusted diluted earnings per share were negatively impacted by 1.7 percentage points and 1.8 percentage points, respectively, as a result of currency translation. Excluding the impact of currency translation, the increase in adjusted net earnings and adjusted diluted net earnings per share for fiscal 2017 was primarily due to an increase in equity earnings from AmerisourceBergen and a lower effective tax rate. See --Non-GAAP Measures below for a reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP measure. - 37 - Fiscal 2016 compared to fiscal 2015  Fiscal 2016 net earnings attributable to Walgreens Boots Alliance decreased 1.1 percent to $4.2 billion, while diluted net earnings per share decreased 4.5 percent to $3.82 compared with the prior year. The decreases reflect fluctuations in the fair value adjustments of the companys AmerisourceBergen warrants and the prior year gain on the previously held equity interest in Alliance Boots, which was largely offset by the inclusion of Alliance Boots consolidated results for the entire period and an increase in operating income at Retail Pharmacy USA. Other income (expense) for fiscal 2016 was an expense of $261 million as compared to income of $685 million in fiscal 2015. The change in fair value of our AmerisourceBergen warrants, excluding deferred income amortization, resulted in a loss of $546 million for fiscal 2016, as compared to income of $759 million for fiscal 2015. Additionally, we recognized income of $268 million for fiscal 2016 related to the change in accounting method for our investment in AmerisourceBergen.  Interest was a net expense of $596 million and $605 million in fiscal 2016 and 2015, respectively. Fiscal 2016 included interest expense on notes issued during June 2016. Fiscal 2015 included interest expense of $99 million related to the repayment of a portion of our long-term debt in advance of its maturity. The effective tax rate for fiscal 2016 and 2015 was 19.4% and 19.9%, respectively. The net decrease in the effective tax rate is attributable to several factors. First, our fiscal 2016 effective tax rate benefited from having a full-year of foreign sourced pre-tax earnings taxed at lower rates as compared to fiscal 2015, when the Company had only eight months of those earnings after the Second Step Transaction. Further, in fiscal 2016 our domestic pre-tax earnings were reduced as a result of the AmerisourceBergen warrants then held by the Company. In addition, during fiscal 2016 the Company benefited from enacted tax law changes (tax rate reductions) in multiple foreign tax jurisdictions, most notably the United Kingdom, which generated a $178 million tax benefit. The Company also had fewer non-deductible expenses in fiscal 2016 as compared to fiscal 2015. These items were partly offset by the facts that in fiscal 2015 the Company had a non-taxable gain on its previously held equity investment in Alliance Boots and recognized the benefit of a capital loss deferred tax asset, neither of which recurred in fiscal 2016. Adjusted diluted net earnings per share (Non-GAAP measure) fiscal 2016 compared to fiscal 2015  Adjusted net earnings attributable to Walgreens Boots Alliance in fiscal 2016 increased 22.6 percent to $5.0 billion compared with the prior year. Adjusted diluted net earnings per share in the fiscal year increased 18.3 percent to $4.59 compared with the prior year. The increase in adjusted net earnings and adjusted diluted net earnings per share for fiscal 2016 was primarily attributable to inclusion of Alliance Boots consolidated results for the entire period and an increase in operating income at Retail Pharmacy USA.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS BY SEGMENT Retail Pharmacy USA As a result of the completion of the Second Step Transaction, the Company ceased recording equity earnings in Alliance Boots as of December 31, 2014.

This adjustment reflects the fact that these prescriptions include approximately three times the amount of product days supplied compared to a normal prescription. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START 4  Comparable stores are defined as those that have been open for at least twelve consecutive months without closure for seven or more consecutive days and without a major remodel or subject to a natural disaster in the past twelve months. Relocated and acquired stores are not included as comparable stores for the first twelve months after the relocation or acquisition. The method of calculating comparable sales varies across the retail industry. As a result, our method of calculating comparable sales may not be the same as other retailers methods. The fiscal year ended August 31, 2016 figures include an adjustment to remove February 29, 2016 results due to the leap year. ##TABLE_END Sales fiscal 2017 compared to fiscal 2016  The Retail Pharmacy USA divisions sales for fiscal 2017  increase d by 4.2% to $87.3 billion . Sales increase d primarily due to higher comparable store sales, which were up 2.8% in fiscal 2017 driven by growth in Medicare Part D prescriptions and strategic partnerships. Sales were also higher due to the inclusion of five months of results for AllianceRx Walgreens Prime, our recently formed central specialty and mail services business. We operated 8,109 locations ( 8,100  retail stores ) as of August 31,  2017 , compared to 8,184 locations ( 8,175  retail stores ) a year earlier. Pharmacy sales increase d by 7.3% in fiscal 2017 and represented 69.4% of the divisions sales. The increase in fiscal 2017 is due to higher prescription volumes, including central specialty and mail following the formation of AllianceRx Walgreens Prime in March 2017. This increase was partially offset by the impact of generics and reimbursement pressure. In fiscal 2016 , pharmacy sales increased 5.5% and represented 67.4% of the divisions sales. Comparable pharmacy sales increase d 4.7% in fiscal 2017 compared to an increase of 6.0% in fiscal 2016 . The effect of generic drugs, which have a lower retail price, replacing brand name drugs reduced prescription sales by 2.4% in fiscal 2017 compared to a reduction of 1.9% in fiscal 2016 . The effect of generics on division sales was a reduction of 1.5% in fiscal 2017 compared to a reduction of 1.1% for fiscal 2016 . Third party sales, where reimbursement is received from managed care organizations, governmental agencies, employers or private insurers, were 97.7% of prescription sales for fiscal 2017 compared to 97.4% for fiscal 2016 . The total number of prescriptions (including immunizations) filled in fiscal 2017 was 764.4 million compared to 740.1 million in fiscal 2016 . Prescriptions (including immunizations) adjusted to 30-day equivalents were 989.7 million in fiscal 2017 compared to 928.5 million in fiscal 2016 . The increase in prescription volume was primarily driven by Medicare Part D growth and the impact of strategic partnerships. - 39 - Retail sales decrease d 2.4% in fiscal 2017 and were 30.6% of the divisions sales. In comparison, fiscal 2016 retail sales decrease d 0.3% and comprised 32.6% of the divisions sales. Comparable retail sales decrease d 1.0% in fiscal 2017 compared to a decrease of 0.3% in fiscal 2016 . The decrease in comparable retail sales growth in fiscal 2017 was primarily due to declines in the consumables and general merchandise category and in the personal care category, which were partially offset by growth in the health and wellness category, and in the beauty category.  Operating income fiscal 2017 compared to fiscal 2016  Retail Pharmacy USA divisions operating income for fiscal 2017  decrease d 4.8% to $4.2 billion . The decrease was primarily due to higher selling, general and administrative expenses related to the Rite Aid transaction and the Cost Transformation Program, partially offset by an increase in gross profit. Gross margin as a percent of sales was 25.7% in fiscal 2017 compared to 26.6% in fiscal 2016 . Pharmacy margins were negatively impacted in the current fiscal year by lower third-party reimbursements and a higher mix of specialty sales. The decrease in pharmacy margins was partially offset by the favorable impact of procurement efficiencies. Retail margins were positively impacted in the current fiscal year primarily due to underlying margin improvement from actions taken the prior year, changes in promotional plans and sales mix. Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales were 20.9% in fiscal 2017 compared to 21.4% in fiscal 2016 . As a percentage of sales, expenses in the current fiscal year were low er primarily due to higher sales, sales mix and increased efficiencies from the Cost Transformation Program.  Adjusted operating income (Non-GAAP measure) fiscal 2017 compared to fiscal 2016  Retail Pharmacy USA divisions adjusted operating income for fiscal 2017  increase d 6.5% to $5.7 billion . The increase was primarily due to higher pharmacy volume, lower selling, general and administrative expenses and improved retail margins. See --Non-GAAP Measures below for a reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP measure.  Sales fiscal 2016 compared to fiscal 2015  The Retail Pharmacy USA divisions sales for fiscal 2016 increased by 3.5% to $83.8 billion. Sales increased primarily due to higher comparable store sales, which were up 3.8% in fiscal 2016 driven by growth in Medicare Part D prescriptions, partially offset by the impact from the sale of a majority interest in our infusion business in fiscal 2015. We operated 8,184 locations (8,175  retail stores ) as of August 31, 2016, compared to 8,182 locations (8,173  retail stores ) a year earlier. Pharmacy sales increased by 5.5% in fiscal 2016 and represented 67.4% of the divisions sales. In fiscal 2015, pharmacy sales were up 8.2% and represented 66.1% of the divisions sales. Comparable pharmacy sales increased 6.0% in fiscal 2016 compared to an increase of 9.3% in fiscal 2015. The effect of generic drugs, which have a lower retail price, replacing brand name drugs reduced prescription sales by 1.9% in fiscal 2016 versus a reduction of 1.8% in fiscal 2015. The effect of generics on division sales was a reduction of 1.1% in fiscal 2016 compared to a reduction of 1.0% for fiscal 2015. Third party sales, where reimbursement is received from managed care organizations, governmental agencies, employers or private insurers, were 97.4% of prescription sales for fiscal 2016 compared to 96.8% for fiscal 2015. The total number of prescriptions (including immunizations) filled in fiscal 2016 was 740.1 million compared to 723.2 million in fiscal 2015. Prescriptions (including immunizations) adjusted to 30-day equivalents were 928.5 million in fiscal 2016 versus 893.8 million in fiscal 2015. Retail sales decreased 0.3% in fiscal 2016 and were 32.6% of the divisions sales. In comparison, fiscal 2015 retail sales increased 1.9% and comprised 33.9% of the divisions sales. Comparable retail sales decreased 0.3% in fiscal 2016 compared to an increase of 1.5% in fiscal 2015. The decrease in comparable retail sales growth in fiscal 2016 was primarily due to weakness in the consumables and general merchandise category, which was partially offset by increased sales in the health and wellness, and photo categories. Operating income fiscal 2016 compared to fiscal 2015  Retail Pharmacy USA divisions operating income for fiscal 2016 increased 13.2% to $4.4 billion. The increase was primarily due to higher pharmacy volume and lower selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales. Gross margin as a percent of sales was 26.6% in fiscal 2016 compared to 26.9% in fiscal 2015. Pharmacy margins were negatively impacted in fiscal 2016 by lower third-party reimbursements. The decrease in pharmacy margins was partially offset by the favorable impact of procurement efficiencies. Retail margins were negatively impacted in fiscal 2016 primarily from performance in seasonal, consumables and general merchandise categories, partially offset by performance in the health and wellness, beauty and photo categories. - 40 - Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales were 21.4% in fiscal 2016 compared to 22.5% in fiscal 2015. As a percentage of sales, expenses in fiscal 2016 were lower primarily due to increased efficiencies and cost controls associated with the Cost Transformation Program. Adjusted operating income (Non-GAAP measure) fiscal 2016 compared to fiscal 2015  Retail Pharmacy USA divisions adjusted operating income for fiscal 2016 increased 5.1% to $5.4 billion. The increase was primarily due to higher pharmacy volume and lower selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales. See --Non-GAAP Measures below for a reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP measure. Retail Pharmacy International The businesses included in our Retail Pharmacy International division were acquired as part of the Second Step Transaction. The Retail Pharmacy International divisions results for fiscal 2017 and 2016 as compared to fiscal 2015 were primarily impacted by the Second Step Transaction, which resulted in the full consolidation of Alliance Boots results of operations beginning December 31, 2014. Accordingly, the results for this segment for fiscal 2017 and 2016 include the results of Alliance Boots on a fully consolidated basis, while fiscal 2015 results include only eight months (January through August 2015) on a fully consolidated basis, and as such, results are not directly comparable.

Short-term investment objectives are primarily to minimize risk and maintain liquidity. To attain these objectives, investment limits are placed on the amount, type and issuer of securities. Investments are principally in U.S. Treasury money market funds and AAA-rated money market funds. Our long-term capital policy is to maintain a strong balance sheet and financial flexibility, reinvest in our core strategies, invest in strategic opportunities that reinforce our core strategies and meet return requirements, and return surplus cash flow to stockholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases over the long term. Cash provided by operations and the issuance of debt are the principal sources of funds for expansion, investments, acquisitions, remodeling programs, dividends to stockholders and stock repurchases. Net cash provided by operating activities was $7.3 billion in fiscal 2017 compared to $7.8 billion in fiscal 2016 and $5.7 billion in fiscal 2015 . The $596 million  decrease in cash provided by operating activities was primarily due to lower cash inflows from changes in accrued expenses and other liabilities and accounts receivable, net partially offset by higher cash inflows from changes in inventories. Decreases in cash inflows on accrued expenses and other liabilities resulted primarily from the timing and payment of expense related accruals. Decreases in cash inflows on accounts receivable, net are primarily due to the timing of collections in Retail Pharmacy USA. Increases in cash inflows on inventories resulted primarily from Retail Pharmacy USA inventory management initiatives related to simplified retail product offering, promotional efficiencies and lower brand name drug inflation. Net cash used for investing activities was $0.8 billion in fiscal 2017 compared to $3.5 billion in fiscal 2016 and $4.3 billion in fiscal 2015 . Business acquisitions in fiscal 2017 were $88 million compared to $126 million for the year-ago period. Business acquisitions in the current year primarily relate to the purchase of prescription files. Business acquisitions in the comparable prior year period include the acquisition of an international beauty brand and prescription files. Fiscal 2016 also included an investment in AmerisourceBergen of $2.4 billion as a result of the exercise of warrants. Additions to property, plant and equipment in fiscal 2017 were $1.4 billion compared to $1.3 billion in fiscal 2016 and $1.3 billion in fiscal 2015 . Capital expenditures by reporting segment were as follows: ##TABLE_START     Retail Pharmacy USA  $  $  $ Retail Pharmacy International 1    Pharmaceutical Wholesale 1    Total  $ 1,351 $ 1,325 $ 1,251 ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START 1  Our Retail Pharmacy International and Pharmaceutical Wholesale segments were acquired as part of the Second Step Transaction in which we acquired the 55% of Alliance Boots that we did not already own on December 31, 2014. As a result of the timing of the acquisition, only eight months of capital expenditures (January through August 2015) were reported for these divisions in fiscal 2015. ##TABLE_END Significant capital expenditures in fiscal 2017 primarily relate to investments in our stores and information technology projects. - 47 - Additionally, investing activities for fiscal 2017 included proceeds related to sale leaseback transactions of $444 million , compared to $60 million in the comparable prior year period. Net cash used for financing activities in fiscal 2017 was $12.9 billion compared to net cash provided by financing activities of $2.6 billion in fiscal 2016 . Net cash used for financing activities was $0.9 billion in fiscal 2015 . We repurchased shares as part of the $1 billion and $5 billion stock repurchase programs described below and to support the needs of the employee stock plans totaling $457 million in fiscal 2017 , compared to $1.0 billion in fiscal 2016 and $500 million in fiscal 2015 . Proceeds related to employee stock plans were $217 million in fiscal 2017 compared to $235 million in fiscal 2016 and $503 million in fiscal 2015 . Cash dividends paid were $1.7 billion in fiscal 2017 compared to $1.6 billion and $1.4 billion in fiscal 2016 and 2015 , respectively. In fiscal 2017 , there were no public debt offerings compared to $6 billion proceeds received from U.S. dollar denominated debt in fiscal 2016 (described below). We currently intend to continue to maintain a long-term dividend payout ratio target of approximately 30 to 35 percent of adjusted net earnings attributable to Walgreens Boots Alliance. We believe that cash flow from operations, availability under our existing credit facilities and arrangements, current cash and investment balances and our ability to obtain other financing, if necessary, will provide adequate cash funds for our foreseeable working capital needs, capital expenditures at existing facilities, acquisitions (including the acquisition of Rite Aid assets), dividend payments and debt service obligations for at least the next 12 months. Our cash requirements are subject to change as business conditions warrant and opportunities arise. The timing and size of any new business ventures or acquisitions that we may complete may also impact our cash requirements. See item 7A (qualitative and quantitative disclosures about market risk) below for a discussion of certain financing and market risks. Stock repurchase programs In August 2014, the Walgreens Board of Directors authorized a stock repurchase program (the 2014 stock repurchase program), which authorized the repurchase of up to $3.0 billion of Walgreens (or, after the Reorganization, Walgreens Boots Alliances) common stock prior to the programs expiration on August 31, 2016. The Company purchased 1.3 million shares in fiscal 2016 at a total cost of $110 million and 8.2 million shares in fiscal 2015 at a total cost of $726 million under the 2014 stock repurchase program. In April 2017, Walgreens Boots Alliance authorized a stock repurchase program (the April 2017 stock repurchase program), which authorized the repurchase of up to $1.0 billion of Walgreens Boots Alliance common stock prior to the programs expiration on December 31, 2017. In May 2017, the Company completed the April 2017 stock repurchase program, purchasing 11.8 million shares. In June 2017, Walgreens Boots Alliance authorized a new stock repurchase program (the June 2017 stock repurchase program), which authorizes the repurchase of up to $5.0 billion of Walgreens Boots Alliance common stock prior to the programs expiration on August 31, 2018. The Company purchased 47.2 million shares in fiscal 2017 at a total cost of $ 3.8 billion under the June 2017 stock repurchase program. The Company completed the authorized $5.0 billion of stock repurchases in October 2017. On October 24, 2017, the Company expanded the June 2017 stock repurchase program by an additional $1.0 billion. See part II, item 5 below for additional information. We determine the timing and amount of repurchases, including repurchases to offset anticipated dilution from equity incentive plans, based on our assessment of various factors, including prevailing market conditions, alternate uses of capital, liquidity and the economic environment. We have repurchased, and may from time to time in the future repurchase, shares on the open market through Rule 10b5-1 plans, which enable us to repurchase shares at times when we otherwise might be precluded from doing so under insider trading laws.  Commercial paper The Company periodically borrows under its commercial paper program and may borrow under it in future periods. There were no commercial paper borrowings outstanding as of August 31, 2017 or 2016 . The Company did not issue any commercial paper under its commercial paper program in fiscal 2017. The Company had weighted average daily short-term borrowings of $14 million of commercial paper outstanding at a weighted average interest rate of 0.66% in fiscal 2016. Financing actions On November 10, 2014, Walgreens Boots Alliance and Walgreens entered into a term loan credit agreement with the lenders party thereto (the 2014 Term Loan Agreement), which provided Walgreens Boots Alliance and Walgreens with the ability to borrow up to 1.45 billion on an unsecured basis. As of August 31, 2016 , Walgreens Boots Alliance had borrowed 1.45 billion ($1.9 billion at the August 31, 2016 spot rate of $1.31 to 1) under the 2014 Term Loan Agreement. On August 30, 2017, Walgreens Boots Alliance used available cash to repay in full all outstanding loans and obligations under the 2014 Term Loan Agreement, which, as of such date, consisted of the remaining unamortized amount of 1.41 billion ($1.83 billion at the August 31, 2017 spot rate of $1.295 to 1) aggregate principal amount of outstanding loans together with accrued interest - 48 - thereon through, but excluding, the payment date, and such other amounts required to be paid by Walgreens Boots Alliance thereunder and the 2014 Term Loan Agreement terminated in accordance with its terms.  On November 10, 2014, Walgreens Boots Alliance and Walgreens entered into a five-year unsecured, multicurrency revolving credit agreement with the lenders party thereto (the 2014 Revolving Credit Agreement), which has available credit of $3.0 billion, of which $500 million is available for the issuance of letters of credit. Borrowings under the 2014 Revolving Credit Agreement bear interest at a fluctuating rate per annum equal to, at Walgreens Boots Alliances option, the alternate base rate or the reserve adjusted LIBOR, in each case, plus an applicable margin calculated based on Walgreens Boots Alliances credit ratings. As of August 31, 2017 and 2016 , there were no borrowings or letters of credit issued pursuant to the 2014 Revolving Credit Agreement. We pay, or paid in the case of the 2014 Term Loan Agreement, certain customary fees in connection with these facilities. Walgreens guaranteed the punctual payment when due, whether at stated maturity, by acceleration or otherwise, of all obligations of Walgreens Boots Alliance under the 2014 Term Loan Agreement and the 2014 Revolving Credit Agreement until August 10, 2015, when such guarantees were unconditionally released and discharged (as described below). On November 18, 2014, Walgreens Boots Alliance issued several series of unsecured, unsubordinated notes totaling $8.0 billion, with maturities ranging from 2016 to 2044. All such notes have fixed interest rates, with the exception of the $750 million floating rate notes due 2016, which were repaid in full in May 2016 and which had a floating rate based on the three month LIBOR plus a fixed spread of 45 basis points. On August 28, 2017, Walgreens Boots Alliance redeemed in full its $750 million 1.750% notes due 2017 at a make-whole redemption price. On November 20, 2014, Walgreens Boots Alliance issued series of unsecured, unsubordinated notes that included total Pound Sterling denominated debt of 700 million ($1.1 billion based on the November 20, 2014 exchange rate) with maturities due 2020 and 2025 and Euro denominated debt of 750 million ($940 million based on the November 20, 2014 exchange rate) due 2026. All notes issued on November 20, 2014 have fixed interest rates. The notes issued on November 18, 2014 and November 20, 2014 are collectively referred to as the 2014 WBA notes. The 2014 WBA notes were, upon initial issuance, fully and unconditionally guaranteed on an unsecured and unsubordinated basis by Walgreens. On August 10, 2015, pursuant to an indenture, dated as of July 17, 2008, between Walgreens and Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as trustee, Walgreens redeemed (i) $1.0 billion aggregate principal amount of 1.800% unsecured notes due 2017 and (ii) $750 million aggregate principal amount of 5.25% unsecured notes due 2019, in each case issued by Walgreens under the indenture. As a result of these redemptions, $250 million aggregate principal amount of 5.25% unsecured notes due 2019 remain outstanding. On August 10, 2015, upon the completion of the redemptions described above, the Walgreens guarantees of the 2014 WBA notes, the 2014 Term Loan Agreement and the 2014 Revolving Credit Agreement were unconditionally released and discharged in accordance with their terms. On June 1, 2016, Walgreens Boots Alliance issued in an underwritten public offering $1.2 billion of 1.750% notes due 2018 (the 2018 notes), $1.5 billion of 2.600% notes due 2021 (the 2021 notes), $0.8 billion of 3.100% notes due 2023 (the 2023 notes), $1.9 billion of 3.450% notes due 2026 (the 2026 notes) and $0.6 billion of 4.650% notes due 2046 (the 2046 notes). Because the merger with Rite Aid was not consummated on or prior to June 1, 2017, the 2018 notes, the 2021 notes and the 2023 notes were redeemed on June 5, 2017 under the special mandatory redemption terms of the indenture governing such notes. The 2026 notes and 2046 notes remain outstanding in accordance with their respective terms and are subject to redemption in certain circumstances. On February 1, 2017, Walgreens Boots Alliance entered into a $1.0 billion revolving credit facility (as amended, the February 2017 Revolving Credit Agreement) with the lenders from time to time party thereto and, on August 1, 2017, Walgreens Boots Alliance entered into an amendment agreement thereto. The terms and conditions of the February 2017 Revolving Credit Agreement were unchanged by the amendment other than the extension of the facility termination date to the earlier of (a) January 31, 2019 and (b) the date of termination in whole of the aggregate commitments provided by the lenders thereunder. Borrowings under the February 2017 Revolving Credit Agreement will bear interest at a fluctuating rate per annum equal to, at Walgreens Boots Alliances option, the alternate base rate or the reserve adjusted Eurocurrency rate, in each case, plus an applicable margin calculated based on Walgreens Boots Alliances credit ratings. In connection with the February 2017 Revolving Credit Agreement, Walgreens Boots Alliance paid upfront fees of $0.5 million and additional extension fees of $0.5 million in respect of the amendment to the February 2017 Revolving Credit Agreement. In addition, Walgreens Boots Alliance - 49 - has agreed to pay to the lenders under the February 2017 Revolving Credit Agreement certain customary fees. As of August 31, 2017, there were no borrowings under the February 2017 Revolving Credit Agreement. On August 24, 2017, Walgreens Boots Alliance entered into a $1.0 billion revolving credit agreement (the August 2017 Revolving Credit Agreement) with the lenders from time to time party thereto and a $1.0 billion term loan credit agreement (the 2017 Term Loan Credit Agreement and together with the August 2017 Revolving Credit Agreement, the August 2017 Credit Agreements) with Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation. The August 2017 Revolving Credit Agreement is an unsecured revolving credit facility with a facility termination date of the earlier of (a) January 31, 2019, subject to any extension thereof pursuant to the terms of the August 2017 Revolving Credit Agreement and (b) the date of termination in whole of the aggregate commitments provided by the lenders thereunder. The 2017 Term Loan Credit Agreement is an unsecured multi-draw term loan facility maturing on March 30, 2019. The aggregate commitments of Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation under the 2017 Term Loan Credit Agreement are initially equal to $1.0 billion, which shall be reduced on June 1, 2018 to the lesser of $500 million and the aggregate remaining undrawn commitments thereunder. Any remaining undrawn commitments thereunder and the ability of Walgreens Boots Alliance to request loans under such commitments shall terminate on September 1, 2018. Borrowings under the August 2017 Credit Agreements will bear interest at a fluctuating rate per annum equal to, at Walgreens Boots Alliances option, the alternate base rate or the Eurocurrency rate, in each case, plus an applicable margin calculated based on Walgreens Boots Alliances credit ratings. Upfront fees paid to date in connection with the August 2017 Credit Agreements totaled $1.25 million. In addition, Walgreens Boots Alliance has agreed to pay to the lenders under the August 2017 Credit Agreements certain customary fees. As of August 31, 2017, there were no borrowings under either of the August 2017 Credit Agreements. Debt covenants Each of the Companys credit facilities described above contain a covenant to maintain, as of the last day of each fiscal quarter, a ratio of consolidated debt to total capitalization not to exceed 0.60:1.00. The credit facilities contain various other customary covenants. In the case of the 2017 Term Loan Credit Agreement, such covenants are only effective after the date of initial funding. As of August 31, 2017, the Company was in compliance with all such applicable covenants. Terminated Rite Aid transaction In connection with the Merger Agreement with Rite Aid, which was terminated on June 28, 2017, we entered into various financing arrangements and facilities, none of which were drawn upon and all of which have been terminated. See note 8, borrowings to the Consolidated Financial Statements. As described above, because the merger with Rite Aid was not consummated on or prior to June 1, 2017, the 2018 notes, the 2021 notes and the 2023 notes issued on June 1, 2016 were redeemed on June 5, 2017 under the special mandatory redemption terms of the indenture governing such notes. Walgreens Boots Alliance was required to redeem all of such notes then outstanding, at a special mandatory redemption price equal to 101% of the aggregate principal amount of such notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest of approximately $1 million to, but excluding, the date of redemption. Pursuant to the Termination Agreement, the Company paid Rite Aid the termination fee of $325 million during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017, in full satisfaction of any amounts required to be paid by the Company under the Merger Agreement and other Transaction Documents. In connection with the termination of the Freds Asset Purchase Agreement, during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017, the Company reimbursed $25 million of Freds transaction costs in full satisfaction of any amounts required to be paid by the Company under the Freds Asset Purchase Agreement. Credit ratings As of October 24, 2017, the credit ratings of Walgreens Boots Alliance were:  ##TABLE_START Rating Agency Long-Term Debt Rating Commercial Paper Rating Outlook Fitch BBB F2 Stable Moodys Baa2 P-2 Stable Standard  Poors BBB A-2 Stable ##TABLE_ENDIn assessing our credit strength, each rating agency consider various factors including our business model, capital structure, financial policies and financial performance. There can be no assurance that any particular rating will be assigned or maintained. Our credit ratings impact our borrowing costs, access to capital markets and operating lease costs. The rating agency ratings are not recommendations to buy, sell or hold our debt securities or commercial paper. Each rating may be - 50 - subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating agency and should be evaluated independently of any other rating. AmerisourceBergen relationship Pursuant to our arrangements with AmerisourceBergen, we have the right, but not the obligation, to purchase a minority equity position in AmerisourceBergen over time as described under --AmerisourceBergen Corporation relationship above. As of August 31, 2017 , the Company owned 56,854,867 AmerisourceBergen common shares representing approximately 26% of the outstanding AmerisourceBergen common stock. This includes a total of approximately 11.5 million shares of AmerisourceBergen that we purchased in the open market. Subject to applicable legal and contractual requirements, share purchases may be made from time to time in open market transactions or pursuant to instruments and plans complying with Rule 10b5-1.  On March 18, 2016, we exercised warrants to purchase 22,696,912 shares of AmerisourceBergen common stock at an exercise price of $51.50 per share for an aggregate exercise price payment of $1.17 billion. On August 25, 2016, we exercised additional warrants to purchase 22,696,912 shares of AmerisourceBergen common stock at an exercise price of $52.50 per share for an aggregate exercise price payment of $1.19 billion. The transactions were funded using existing cash on hand. See note 5, equity method investments, to the Consolidated Financial Statements included herein for further information. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES The information set forth in note 11, commitments and contingencies to our Consolidated Financial Statements included in part II, item 8 of this Form 10-K is incorporated herein by reference. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES The Consolidated Financial Statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America and include amounts based on managements prudent judgments and estimates. Actual results may differ from these estimates. Management believes that any reasonable deviation from those judgments and estimates would not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations. To the extent that the estimates used differ from actual results, however, adjustments to the statement of earnings and corresponding balance sheet accounts would be necessary. These adjustments would be made in future periods. Some of the more significant estimates include business combinations, goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment, cost of sales and inventory, equity method investments, pension and postretirement benefits and income taxes. We use the following methods to determine our estimates:  Business combinations   We account for business combinations using the acquisition method of accounting, which requires that once control is obtained, all the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, including amounts attributable to noncontrolling interests, be recorded at their respective fair values at the date of acquisition. The determination of fair values of assets and liabilities acquired requires estimates and the use of valuation techniques when market value is not readily available. For intangible assets, we generally use the income approach to determine fair value. The income approach requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions. These estimates and assumptions primarily include, but are not limited to: discount rates, terminal growth rates, royalty rates, forecasts of revenue, operating income, depreciation, amortization and capital expenditures. The discount rates applied to the projections reflect the risk factors associated with those projections. Although we believe our estimates of fair value are reasonable, actual financial results could differ from those estimates due to the inherent uncertainty involved in making such estimates. Changes in assumptions concerning future financial results or other underlying assumptions could have a significant impact on the determination of the fair value of the intangible assets acquired. Judgment is also required in determining the intangible assets useful life. Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment  Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are evaluated for impairment annually during the fourth quarter, or more frequently if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value. As part of our impairment analysis for each reporting unit, we determine fair value for each reporting unit. This determination includes estimating the fair value using both the income and market approaches. The income approach requires management to estimate a number of factors for each reporting unit, including projected future operating results, economic projections, anticipated future cash flows and discount rates. The market approach estimates fair value using comparable marketplace fair value data from within a comparable industry grouping. - 51 - The determination of the fair value of the reporting units requires us to make significant estimates and assumptions. These estimates and assumptions primarily include, but are not limited to: the selection of appropriate peer group companies, control premiums appropriate for acquisitions in the industries in which we compete, discount rates, terminal growth rates, forecasts of revenue, operating income, depreciation, amortization and capital expenditures. Although we believe our estimates of fair value are reasonable, actual financial results could differ from those estimates due to the inherent uncertainty involved in making such estimates. Changes in assumptions concerning future financial results or other underlying assumptions could have a significant impact on either the fair value of the reporting units, the amount of any goodwill impairment charge, or both. We also compared the sum of the estimated fair values of the reporting units to the Companys fair value as implied by the market value of the Companys equity and debt securities. This comparison indicated that, in total, our assumptions and estimates were reasonable. However, future declines in the overall market value of the Companys equity securities may indicate that the fair value of one or more reporting units has declined below its carrying value. Our reporting units fair values exceeded their carrying amounts ranging from approximately 9% to more than 400% . Due to the negative impact of reductions in pharmacy funding in the United Kingdom, the fair value of our Boots reporting unit, within our Retail Pharmacy International division, was impacted and is in excess of its carrying value by approximately 9%. The goodwill of the Boots reporting unit is not currently impaired and we will continue to monitor the U.K. industry trends and the impact it may have on the business. See note 7, goodwill and other intangible assets, to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.  Indefinite-lived intangible assets are tested by comparing the estimated fair value of the asset to its carrying value. If the carrying value of the asset exceeds its estimated fair value, an impairment loss is recognized and the asset is written down to its estimated fair value. Our indefinite-lived intangible asset fair value is estimated using the relief from royalty method and excess earnings method of the income approach. These estimates can be affected by a number of factors including, but not limited to, general economic conditions, availability of market information as well as our profitability. Cost of sales and inventory  Cost of sales includes the purchase price of goods and services sold, store and warehouse inventory loss, inventory obsolescence, manufacturing costs, certain direct product design and development costs and supplier rebates. In addition to product costs, cost of sales includes manufacturing costs, warehousing costs for retail operations, purchasing costs, freight costs, cash discounts and vendor allowances. Cost of sales for our Retail Pharmacy USA segment is derived based upon point-of-sale scanning information with an estimate for shrinkage and is adjusted based on periodic inventory counts. Inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market determined by the last-in, first-out (LIFO) method for the Retail Pharmacy USA segment and primarily on a first-in first-out (FIFO) basis for inventory in the Retail Pharmacy International and Pharmaceutical Wholesale segments.  Equity method investments    We use the equity method to account for investments in companies if the investment provides the ability to exercise significant influence, but not control, over operating and financial policies of the investee. Our proportionate share of the net income or loss of these companies is included in consolidated net earnings. Judgment regarding the level of influence over each equity method investment includes considering key factors such as our ownership interest, representation on the board of directors, participation in policy-making decisions and material purchase and sale transactions. We evaluate equity method investments for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the investment might not be recoverable. Factors considered when reviewing an equity method investment for impairment include the length of time (duration) and the extent (severity) to which the fair value of the equity method investment has been less than cost, the investees financial condition and near-term prospects, and the intent and ability to hold the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for anticipated recovery. An impairment that is other-than-temporary is recognized in the period identified.  Pension and postretirement benefits  We have various defined benefit pension plans that cover some of our foreign employees. We also have postretirement healthcare plans that cover qualifying domestic employees. Eligibility and the level of benefits for these plans varies depending on participants status, date of hire and or length of service. Our pension and postretirement expenses and valuations are dependent on assumptions used by our actuaries in calculating those amounts. These assumptions include discount rates, healthcare cost trends, long-term rate of return on plan assets, retirement rates, mortality rates and other factors. In determining our long-term rate of return on plan assets assumption, we consider both the historical performance of the investment portfolio as well as the long-term market return expectations based on the investment mix of the portfolio. A change in any of these assumptions would have an effect on our projected benefit obligation and pension expense. A 25 basis point increase in the discount rate would result in a decline of $389 million to our pension benefit - 52 - obligation. A 25 basis point decrease on the expected return on plan assets assumption would increase our pension expense by $22 million. Our policy is to fund our pension plans in accordance with applicable regulations. Our postretirement healthcare plans are not funded.  Income taxes  We are subject to routine income tax audits that occur periodically in the normal course of business. U.S. federal, state, local and foreign tax authorities raise questions regarding our tax filing positions, including the timing and amount of deductions and the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions. In evaluating the tax benefits associated with our various tax filing positions, we record a tax benefit for uncertain tax positions using the highest cumulative tax benefit that is more likely than not to be realized. Adjustments are made to our liability for unrecognized tax benefits in the period in which we determine the issue is effectively settled with the tax authorities, the statute of limitations expires for the return containing the tax position or when more information becomes available. Our liability for unrecognized tax benefits, including accrued penalties and interest, is primarily included in other long-term liabilities and current income taxes on our Consolidated Balance Sheets and in income tax provision in our Consolidated Statements of Earnings.  In determining our provision for income taxes, we use income, permanent differences between book and tax income and enacted statutory income tax rates. The provision for income taxes rate also reflects our assessment of the ultimate outcome of tax audits in addition to any foreign-based income deemed to be taxable in the United States. Discrete events such as audit settlements or changes in tax laws are recognized in the period in which they occur. - 53 - CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS AND COMMITMENTS The following table lists our contractual obligations and commitments at August 31, 2017 (in millions): ##TABLE_START   Payments due by period   Total  Less than 1 year  1-3 years  3-5 years  Over 5 years Operating leases 1  $ 31,441  $ 3,074  $ 5,642  $ 4,770  $ 17,955 Purchase obligations:  3,122  2,575     Open inventory purchase orders  1,944  1,944       Real estate development        Other corporate obligations       Short-term borrowings and long-term debt *  13,027   1,533  1,765  9,475 Interest payment on short term borrowings and long-term debt  5,614     3,520 Insurance *      Retirement benefit obligations  1,070     Closed location obligations 1  1,370     Capital lease obligations* 1  1,210     Finance lease obligations      Other liabilities reflected on the balance sheet* 2      Total  $ 58,672 $ 7,119 $ 9,554 $ 7,912 $ 34,087 ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START * Recorded on balance sheet. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START 1  Amounts for operating leases and capital leases do not include certain operating expenses under these leases such as common area maintenance, insurance and real estate taxes. These expenses  were $429 million for th e fiscal year ended August 31, 2017 . ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START 2  Includes $ 452 million ($159 million in less than 1 year, $239 million in 1-3 years, $48 million in 3-5 years and $6 million over 5 years) of unrecognized tax benefits recorded under Accounting Standards Codification Topic 740, Income Taxes. ##TABLE_END The information in the foregoing table is presented as of August 31, 2017 and accordingly does not reflect obligations under agreements we entered into after that date. OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS We do not have any unconsolidated special purpose entities and, except as described herein, we do not have significant exposure to any off-balance sheet arrangements. The term off-balance sheet arrangement generally means any transaction, agreement or other contractual arrangement to which an entity unconsolidated with us is a party, under which we have: (i) any obligation arising under a guarantee contract, derivative instrument or variable interest; or (ii) a retained or contingent interest in assets transferred to such entity or similar arrangement that serves as credit, liquidity or market risk support for such assets. At August 31, 2017 , we have issued $280 million in letters of credit, primarily related to insurance obligations.  We also had $46 million of guarantees outstanding at August 31, 2017 . We remain secondarily liable on 70 leases. The maximum potential undiscounted future payments related to these leases was $327 million at August 31, 2017 .

", "7A": " Item 7A. Quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk Interest rate risk We are exposed to interest rate volatility with regard to existing debt issuances. Primary exposures include LIBOR and commercial paper rates. From time to time, we use interest rate derivative contracts including interest rate caps, interest rate swaps and forward-starting interest rate swaps to hedge our exposure to the impact of interest rate changes on existing debt and future debt issuances respectively, to reduce the volatility of our financing costs and, based on current and projected market conditions, achieve a desired proportion of fixed versus floating-rate debt. Generally under these swaps, we agree with a - 55 - counterparty to exchange the difference between fixed-rate and floating-rate interest amounts based on an agreed upon notional principal amount. Information regarding our transactions are set forth in note 9, financial instruments to our Consolidated Financial Statements. These financial instruments are sensitive to changes in interest rates. On August 31, 2017 , we had no material long-term debt obligations that had floating interest rates. The amounts exclude the impact of any associated derivative contracts. Foreign currency exchange rate risk We are exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, primarily with respect to the British Pound Sterling and Euro, and certain other foreign currencies, including the Mexican Peso, Swiss Franc and Romanian Leu which may affect our net investment in foreign subsidiaries and may cause fluctuations in cash flows related to foreign denominated transactions. We are also exposed to the translation of foreign currency earnings to the U.S. dollar. We enter into foreign currency forward contracts to hedge against the effect of exchange rate fluctuations on non-functional currency cash flows of certain entities denominated in foreign currencies. These transactions are almost exclusively less than 12 months in maturity. In addition, we enter into foreign currency forward contracts that are not designated in hedging relationships to offset, in part, the impacts of certain intercompany activities (primarily associated with intercompany financing transactions). As circumstances warrant, we also use basis swaps as hedging instruments to hedge portions of our net investments in foreign operations. The foreign currency derivative instruments are sensitive to changes in exchange rates. A 1% increase or decrease in exchange rates would increase or decrease our pre-tax income by approximately $8 million due to changes in the value of foreign currency derivative instruments. Excluded from the computation were anticipated transactions, foreign currency trade payables and receivables, and net investments in foreign subsidiaries, which the abovementioned instruments are intended to partially hedge. Equity price risk Changes in AmerisourceBergen common stock price may have a significant impact on the fair value of the equity investment in AmerisourceBergen described in note 5, equity method investments to our Consolidated Financial Statements.

AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 1. Organization Walgreens Boots Alliance and its subsidiaries are a global pharmacy-led health and wellbeing enterprise. Its operations are conducted through three reportable segments (Retail Pharmacy USA, Retail Pharmacy International and Pharmaceutical Wholesale). See note 17, segment reporting for further information. On December 31, 2014, Walgreens Boots Alliance became the successor of Walgreens pursuant to a merger designed to effect a reorganization of Walgreens into a holding company structure. Pursuant to the Reorganization, Walgreens became a wholly-owned subsidiary of Walgreens Boots Alliance, a Delaware corporation formed for the purposes of the Reorganization, and each issued and outstanding share of Walgreens common stock converted on a one -to-one basis into Walgreens Boots Alliance common stock. References to the Company refer to Walgreens Boots Alliance and its subsidiaries from and after the effective time of the Reorganization on December 31, 2014 and, prior to that time, to the predecessor registrant Walgreens and its subsidiaries, except as otherwise indicated or the context otherwise requires. On December 31, 2014, following the completion of the Reorganization, Walgreens Boots Alliance completed the acquisition of the remaining 55% of Alliance Boots that Walgreens did not previously own in exchange for 3.133 billion in cash and approximately 144.3 million shares of Walgreens Boots Alliance common stock. Alliance Boots became a consolidated subsidiary and ceased being accounted for under the equity method immediately upon completion of the Second Step Transaction. For financial reporting and accounting purposes, Walgreens Boots Alliance was the acquirer of Alliance Boots. The Consolidated Financial Statements (and other data) reflect the results of operations and financial position of Walgreens and its subsidiaries for periods prior to December 31, 2014 and of Walgreens Boots Alliance and its subsidiaries for periods from and after the effective time of the Reorganization on December 31, 2014. 2. Summary of major accounting policies Basis of presentation The Consolidated Financial Statements include all subsidiaries in which the Company holds a controlling interest. Investments in less than majority-owned subsidiaries in which the Company does not have a controlling interest, but does have significant influence, are accounted for as equity method investments. All intercompany transactions have been eliminated. The preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP) requires management to use judgment in the application of accounting policies, including making estimates and assumptions. The Company bases its estimates on the information available at the time, its experience and various other assumptions believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Adjustments may be made in subsequent periods to reflect more current estimates and assumptions about matters that are inherently uncertain. Actual results may differ. The influence of certain holidays, seasonality, foreign currency rates, changes in vendor, payer and customer relationships and terms and other factors on the Companys operations, net earnings for any period may not be comparable to the same period in previous years. With respect to the Companys Retail Pharmacy USA segment, the positive impact on gross profit margins and gross profit dollars typically has been significant in the first several months after a generic version of a drug is first allowed to compete with the branded version, which is generally referred to as a generic conversion. In any given year, the number of major brand name drugs that undergo a conversion from branded to generic status can increase or decrease, which can have a significant impact on the Companys Retail Pharmacy USA segments sales, gross profit margins and gross profit dollars.  Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents include cash on hand and all highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less. Credit and debit card receivables from banks, which generally settle within two to seven business days, of $98 million and $114 million were included in cash and cash equivalents at August 31, 2017 and 2016 , respectively. Restricted cash The Company is required to maintain cash deposits with certain banks which consist of deposits restricted under contractual agency agreements and cash restricted by law and other obligations. As of August 31, 2017 and 2016 , the amount of such restricted cash was $202 million and $185 million , respectively, and is reported in other current assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. - 63 - Accounts receivable Accounts receivable are stated net of allowances for doubtful accounts. Accounts receivable balances primarily include amounts due from third party providers (e.g., pharmacy benefit managers, insurance companies and governmental agencies), clients and members, as well as vendors and manufacturers. Charges to allowance for doubtful accounts are based on estimates of recoverability using both historical write-offs and specifically identified receivables. The allowance for doubtful accounts for fiscal 2017 , 2016 and 2015 was $158 million , $166 million and $172 million , respectively. Inventory The Company values inventories on a lower of cost or market basis. Inventory includes product costs, inbound freight, direct labor, warehousing costs for retail pharmacy operations, overhead costs relating to the manufacture and distribution of products and vendor allowances not classified as a reduction of advertising expense. The Companys Retail Pharmacy USA segment inventory is accounted for using the last-in-first-out (LIFO) method. At August 31, 2017 and 2016 , Retail Pharmacy USA segment inventories would have been greater by $3.0 billion and $2.8 billion , respectively, if they had been valued on a lower of first-in-first-out (FIFO) cost or market basis. The total carrying value of the segment inventory accounted for under the LIFO method is $5.9 billion and $6.1 billion at August 31, 2017 and 2016 , respectively. The Companys Retail Pharmacy International and Pharmaceutical Wholesale segments inventory is primarily accounted for using the FIFO method. The total carrying value of the inventory for Retail Pharmacy International and Pharmaceutical Wholesale segments is $3.0 billion and $2.9 billion at August 31, 2017 and 2016 , respectively. Equity method investments The Company uses the equity method to account for investments in companies if the investment provides the ability to exercise significant influence, but not control, over operating and financial policies of the investee. The Companys proportionate share of the net income or loss of these companies is included in consolidated net earnings. Judgment regarding the level of influence over each equity method investment includes considering key factors such as the Companys ownership interest, representation on the board of directors, participation in policy-making decisions and material intercompany transactions. The Company evaluates equity method investments for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the investment might not be recoverable. Factors considered by the Company when reviewing an equity method investment for impairment include the length of time (duration) and the extent (severity) to which the fair value of the equity method investment has been less than cost, the investees financial condition and near-term prospects, and the intent and ability to hold the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for anticipated recovery. An impairment that is other-than-temporary is recognized in the period identified. See note 5, equity method investments for further information relating to the Companys equity method investments. Property, plant and equipment Depreciation is provided on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of owned assets. Estimated useful lives range from 20 years for land improvements, 3 to 50 for buildings and building improvements and 3 to 20 for fixtures, plant and equipment. Leasehold improvements, equipment under capital lease and capital lease properties are amortized over their respective estimate of useful life or over the term of the lease, whichever is shorter. Major repairs, which extend the useful life of an asset, are capitalized; routine maintenance and repairs are charged against earnings. The majority of the Companys fixtures and equipment uses the composite method of depreciation. Therefore, gains and losses on retirement or other disposition of such assets are included in earnings only when an operating location is closed, substantially remodeled or impaired. Property, plant and equipment consists of (in millions): - 64 - ##TABLE_START    Land and land improvements  $ 3,470  $ 3,738 Buildings and building improvements  7,431  7,557 Fixtures and equipment  9,209  9,064 Capitalized system development costs and software  2,105  1,787 Capital lease properties     22,960  22,935 Less: accumulated depreciation and amortization  9,318  8,600 Balance at end of year  $ 13,642  $ 14,335 ##TABLE_ENDDepreciation and amortization expense for property, plant and equipment was $1.3 billion in fiscal 2017 , $1.3 billion in fiscal 2016 and $1.3 billion in fiscal 2015 . The Company capitalizes application stage development costs for significant internally developed software projects, such as upgrades to the store point-of-sale system. These costs are amortized over a three to eight year period. Amortization expense for capitalized system development costs and software was $245 million in fiscal 2017 , $238 million in fiscal 2016 and $178 million in fiscal 2015 . Unamortized costs at August 31, 2017 and 2016 were $0.9 billion and $0.9 billion , respectively. Business combinations Business combinations are accounted for under Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) Topic 805, Business Combinations, using the acquisition method of accounting. The cost of an acquired company is assigned to the tangible and intangible assets purchased and the liabilities assumed on the basis of their fair values at the date of acquisition. The determination of fair values of assets and liabilities acquired requires estimates and the use of valuation techniques when a market value is not readily available. Any excess of purchase price over the fair value of net tangible and intangible assets acquired is allocated to goodwill. The final determination of the fair value of certain assets and liabilities is completed within the one year measurement period as allowed under ASC Topic 805, Business Combinations. Transaction costs associated with business combinations are expensed as they are incurred. Goodwill and other intangible assets Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed. The Company accounts for goodwill and intangibles under ASC Topic 350, Intangibles  Goodwill and Other, which requires the Company to test goodwill and other indefinite-lived assets for impairment annually or whenever events or circumstances indicate that impairment may exist. Intangible assets are amortized on a straight line basis over their estimated useful lives. See note 7, goodwill and other intangible assets for additional disclosure regarding the Companys intangible assets. Warrants Until their exercise in fiscal 2016, the warrants to acquire shares of AmerisourceBergen Corporation were accounted for as a derivative under ASC Topic 815, Derivatives and Hedging. The Company reports its warrants at fair value within other non-current assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets and changes in the fair value of warrants are recognized in other income in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings. A deferred credit from the day-one valuation attributable to the warrants granted to Walgreens was amortized over the life of the warrants. See note 9, financial instruments, for additional disclosure regarding the Companys warrants.  Financial instruments The Company uses derivative instruments to hedge its exposure to interest rate and currency risks arising from operating and financing activities. In accordance with its risk management policies, the Company does not hold or issue derivative instruments for trading or speculative purposes. Derivatives are recognized on the Consolidated Balance Sheets at their fair values. When the Company becomes a party to a derivative instrument and intends to apply hedge accounting, it formally documents the hedge relationship and the risk management objective for undertaking the hedge which includes designating the instrument for financial reporting purposes as a fair value hedge, a cash flow hedge, or a net investment hedge. The accounting for changes in fair value of a derivative instrument depends on whether the Company had designated it in a qualifying hedging relationship and on the type of hedging relationship. The Company applies the following accounting policies: - 65 - ##TABLE_START  Changes in the fair value of a derivative designated as a fair value hedge, along with the gain or loss on the hedged asset or liability attributable to the hedged risk, are recorded in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  The effective portion of changes in the fair value of a derivative designated as a cash flow hedge is recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income and reclassified into earnings in the period or periods during which the hedged item affects earnings. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  The effective portion of changes in the fair value of a derivative designated as a hedge of a net investment in a foreign operation is recorded in cumulative translation adjustments within accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income. Recognition in earnings of amounts previously recorded in cumulative translation adjustments is limited to circumstances such as complete or substantially complete liquidation of the net investment in the hedged investments in foreign operations. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Changes in the fair value of a derivative not designated in a hedging relationship are recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings along with the ineffective portions of changes in the fair value of derivatives designated in hedging relationships. ##TABLE_END Cash receipts or payments on a settlement of a derivative contract are reported in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows consistent with the nature of the underlying hedged item. For derivative instruments designated as hedges, the Company assesses, both at the hedges inception and on an ongoing basis, whether the derivatives that are used in hedging transactions are highly effective in offsetting changes in fair values or cash flows of hedged items. Highly effective means that cumulative changes in the fair value of the derivative are between 80% and 125% of the cumulative changes in the fair value of the hedged item. In addition, when the Company determines that a derivative is not highly effective as a hedge, hedge accounting is discontinued. When it is probable that a hedged forecasted transaction will not occur, the Company discontinues hedge accounting for the affected portion of the forecasted transaction, and reclassifies any gains or losses in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) to earnings in the Consolidated Statement of Earnings. When a derivative in a hedge relationship is terminated or the hedged item is sold, extinguished or terminated, hedge accounting is discontinued prospectively. Impaired assets The Company tests long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that a certain asset may be impaired. Once identified, the amount of the impairment is computed by comparing the carrying value of the assets to the fair value, which is primarily based on the discounted estimated future cash flows. Impairment charges included in selling, general and administrative expenses were $234 million in fiscal 2017 , primarily related to the Companys Cost Transformation Program (as defined below). Impairment charges recognized in fiscal 2016 and 2015 were $305 million and $386 million , respectively.  Liabilities for store closings The Company provides for future costs related to closed locations. The liability is based on the present value of future rent obligations and other related costs (net of estimated sublease rent) to the first lease option date. The reserve for store closings, including locations closed under the Companys restructuring actions, was $718 million as of August 31, 2017 and $466 million as of August 31, 2016 . See note 4, leases for additional disclosure regarding the Companys reserve for future costs related to closed locations.  Pension and postretirement benefits The Company has various defined benefit pension plans that cover some of its foreign employees. The Company also has postretirement healthcare plans that cover qualifying domestic employees. Eligibility and the level of benefits for these plans vary depending participants status, date of hire and or length of service. Pension and postretirement expenses and valuations are dependent on assumptions used by third party actuaries in calculating those amounts. These assumptions include discount rates, healthcare cost trends, long-term return on plan assets, retirement rates, mortality rates and other factors. See note 14, retirement benefits, for additional disclosure regarding the Companys pension and postretirement benefits. The Company funds its pension plans in accordance with applicable regulations. Noncontrolling interests The Company accounts for its less than 100% interest in consolidated subsidiaries in accordance with ASC Topic 810, Consolidation, and accordingly, the Company presents noncontrolling interests as a component of equity on its Consolidated - 66 - Balance Sheets and reports the portion of its earnings or loss for noncontrolling interest as net earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests in the Consolidated Statement of Earnings. Currency Assets and liabilities of non-U.S. dollar functional currency operations are translated into U.S. dollars at end-of-period exchange rates while revenues, expenses and cash flows are translated at average monthly exchange rates over the period. Equity is translated at historical exchange rates and the resulting cumulative translation adjustments are included as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. For U.S. dollar functional currency operations, foreign currency assets and liabilities are remeasured into U.S. dollars at end-of-period exchange rates, except for nonmonetary balance sheet amounts, which are remeasured from historical exchange rates. Revenues and expenses are recorded at average monthly exchange rates over the period, except for those expenses related to nonmonetary balance sheet amounts, which are remeasured from historical exchange rates. Gains or losses from foreign currency remeasurement and transactions are included in selling, general and administrative expenses within the Consolidated Statements of Earnings. For all periods presented, there were no material operational gains or losses from foreign currency transactions. Revenue recognition Revenue is recognized when: (i) persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, (ii) delivery has occurred or services have been rendered, (iii) the sellers price to the buyer is fixed or determinable and (iv) collectability is reasonably assured. The following revenue recognition policies have been established for the Companys reportable segments. Retail Pharmacy USA and Retail Pharmacy International The Company recognizes revenue at the time the customer takes possession of the merchandise, after making appropriate adjustments for estimated returns. Revenue does not include sales related taxes. In certain international locations, the Company initially estimates revenue based on expected reimbursements from governmental agencies for dispensing prescription drugs and providing optical services. The estimates are based on historical experience and are updated to actual reimbursement amounts. Pharmaceutical Wholesale Wholesale revenue is recognized upon shipment of goods, which is generally also the day of delivery. When the Company acts in the capacity of an agent or a logistics service provider, revenue is the fee received for the service and is recognized when the services have been performed. The Company has determined it is the agent when providing logistics services, which is based on its assessment of the following criteria: (i) whether it is the primary obligor in the arrangement, (ii) whether it has latitude in establishing the price, changing the product or performing part of the service, (iii) whether it has discretion in supplier selection, (iv) whether it is involved in the determination of service specifications and (v) whether it is exposed to credit risk. Cost of sales Cost of sales includes the purchase price of goods and services sold, store and warehouse inventory loss, inventory obsolescence, manufacturing costs, certain direct product design and development costs and supplier rebates. In addition to product costs, cost of sales includes manufacturing costs, warehousing costs for retail operations, purchasing costs, freight costs, cash discounts and vendor allowances. Cost of sales for our Retail Pharmacy USA segment is derived based upon point-of-sale scanning information with an estimate for shrinkage and is adjusted based on periodic inventory counts. Vendor allowances and supplier rebates Vendor allowances are principally received as a result of purchases, sales or promotion of vendors products. Allowances are generally recorded as a reduction of inventory and are recognized as a reduction of cost of sales when the related merchandise is sold. Those allowances received for promoting vendors products are offset against advertising expense and result in a reduction of selling, general and administrative expenses to the extent of advertising costs incurred, with the excess treated as a reduction of inventory costs. Rebates or refunds received by the Company from its suppliers, mostly in cash, are considered as an adjustment of the prices of the suppliers products purchased by the Company. Selling, general and administrative expenses Selling, general and administrative expenses mainly consist of salaries and employee costs, occupancy costs, depreciation and amortization, credit and debit card fees and expenses directly related to stores. In addition, other costs included are headquarters expenses, advertising costs (net of vendor advertising allowances), wholesale warehousing costs and insurance. - 67 - Advertising costs Advertising costs, which are reduced by the portion funded by vendors, are expensed as incurred or when services have been received. Net advertising expenses, which are included in selling, general and administrative expenses, were $571 million in fiscal 2017 , $598 million in fiscal 2016 and $491 million in fiscal 2015 .  Loyalty programs The Companys loyalty rewards programs are accrued as a charge to cost of sales at the time a point is earned. Points are funded internally and through vendor participation and are credited to cost of sales at the time a vendor-sponsored point is earned. Breakage is recorded as points expire as a result of a members inactivity or if the points remain unredeemed after a certain period in accordance with the terms of the loyalty rewards program. Breakage income, which is reported in cost of sales, was not significant in fiscal 2017 , 2016 or 2015 .  Insurance The Company obtains insurance coverage for catastrophic exposures as well as those risks required by law to be insured. In general, the Companys U.S. subsidiaries retain a significant portion of losses related to workers compensation, property, comprehensive general, pharmacist and vehicle liability, while non-U.S. subsidiaries manage their exposures through insurance coverage with third-party carriers. Management regularly reviews the probable outcome of claims and proceedings, the expenses expected to be incurred, the availability and limits of the insurance coverage and the established accruals for liabilities. Liabilities for losses are recorded based upon the Companys estimates for both claims incurred and claims incurred but not reported and are not discounted. The provisions are estimated in part by considering historical claims experience, demographic factors and other actuarial assumptions. Stock compensation plans In accordance with ASC Topic 718, Compensation  Stock Compensation, the Company recognizes compensation expense on a straight-line basis over the employees vesting period or to the employees retirement eligible date, if earlier. See note 13, stock compensation plans for more information on the Companys stock-based compensation plans. Income taxes The Company accounts for income taxes according to the asset and liability method. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized based upon the estimated future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured pursuant to tax laws using rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rate is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. Valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amounts more likely than not to be realized. In determining the provision for income taxes, the Company uses income, permanent differences between book and tax income, the relative proportion of foreign and domestic income, enacted statutory income tax rates, projections of income subject to Subpart F rules and unrecognized tax benefits related to current year results. Discrete events such as the assessment of the ultimate outcome of tax audits, audit settlements, recognizing previously unrecognized tax benefits due to lapsing of the applicable statute of limitations, recognizing or de-recognizing benefits of deferred tax assets due to future year financial statement projections and changes in tax laws are recognized in the period in which they occur. The Company is subject to routine income tax audits that occur periodically in the normal course of business. U.S. federal, state, local and foreign tax authorities raise questions regarding the Companys tax filing positions, including the timing and amount of deductions and the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions. In evaluating the tax benefits associated with the various tax filing positions, the Company records a tax benefit for uncertain tax positions using the highest cumulative tax benefit that is more likely than not to be realized. Adjustments are made to the liability for unrecognized tax benefits in the period in which the Company determines the issue is effectively settled with the tax authorities, the statute of limitations expires for the return containing the tax position or when more information becomes available. Earnings per share The dilutive effect of outstanding stock options on earnings per share is calculated using the treasury stock method. Stock options are anti-dilutive and excluded from the earnings per share calculation if the exercise price exceeds the average market price of the common shares. Outstanding options to purchase common shares that were anti-dilutive and excluded from earnings per share totaled 3.9 million , 2.5 million and 2.5 million in fiscal 2017 , 2016 and 2015 , respectively. New accounting pronouncements - 68 - Adoption of new accounting pronouncements Modifications of share-based payments In May 2017, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2017-09, Compensation  Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Scope of Modification Accounting. This ASU clarifies which changes to the terms or conditions of a share-based payment award require an entity to apply modification accounting in Topic 718. Specifically, an entity would not apply modification accounting if the fair value, vesting conditions, and classification of the awards are the same immediately before and after the modification. This ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017 (fiscal 2019), and interims periods within those fiscal years. The Company early adopted this guidance on a prospective basis during the third quarter of fiscal 2017. The adoption did not have any impact on the Companys results of operations, cash flows or financial position. Simplifying the test for goodwill impairment In January 2017, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2017-04, Intangibles  Goodwill and Other (Topic 350): Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment. This ASU requires the Company to perform its annual, or applicable interim, goodwill impairment test by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount. An impairment charge must be recognized at the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit; however, the charge recognized should not exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. Income tax effects resulting from any tax deductible goodwill should be considered when measuring the goodwill impairment loss, if applicable. This ASU is effective for annual or interim goodwill impairment tests in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019 (fiscal 2021). The Company early adopted this guidance on a prospective basis during the second quarter of fiscal 2017. The adoption did not have any impact on the Companys results of operations, cash flows or financial position. Clarifying the definition of a business In January 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-01, Business Combinations (Topic 805): Clarifying the Definition of a Business. This ASU clarifies the definition of a business in order to assist companies in the evaluation of whether transactions should be accounted for as acquisitions or disposals of assets or businesses. The amended guidance also removes the existing evaluation of a market participants ability to replace missing elements and narrows the definition of output to achieve consistency with other topics. This ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016 (fiscal 2018), and interim periods within those fiscal years. The Company early adopted this guidance on a prospective basis during the second quarter of fiscal 2017. The adoption did not have any impact on the Companys results of operations, cash flows or financial position. Interests held through related parties under common control In October 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-17, Consolidation (Topic 810): Interests Held through Related Parties That Are under Common Control. This ASU amends the consolidation guidance on how a reporting entity that is the single decision maker of a variable interest entity (VIE) should treat indirect interests in the entity held through related parties that are under common control with the reporting entity when determining whether it is the primary beneficiary of that VIE. Under the amendments, a single decision maker is not required to consider indirect interests held through related parties that are under common control with the single decision maker to be the equivalent of direct interests in their entirety. Instead, a single decision maker is required to include those interests on a proportionate basis consistent with indirect interests held through other related parties. This ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016 (fiscal 2018), and interim periods within those fiscal years. The Company early adopted this guidance on a modified retrospective basis during the second quarter of fiscal 2017. The adoption did not have any impact on the Companys results of operations, cash flows or financial position. Share-based payment accounting In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-09, Compensation  Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting. This ASU simplifies the employee share-based payment accounting of stock compensation, including the income tax consequences, classification of awards as either equity or liabilities, and classification on the statement of cash flows. Amendments requiring recognition of excess tax benefits and tax deficiencies in the income statement and the practical expedient for estimating expected term must be applied prospectively. Amendments related to the presentation of employee taxes paid on the statement of cash flows when an employer withholds shares to meet the minimum statutory withholding requirement must be applied retrospectively. An entity may elect to apply the amendments related to the presentation of excess tax benefits on the statement of cash flows using either a prospective transition method or a retrospective transition method. This ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016 (fiscal 2018), and interim periods within those fiscal years. The Company early adopted this guidance on a prospective basis during the first quarter of fiscal 2017. The adoption did not have a material impact on the Companys results of operations, cash flows or financial position. - 69 - New accounting pronouncements not yet adopted Accounting for hedging activities In August 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-12, Derivative and Hedging (Topic 815): Targeted Improvements to Accounting for Hedging Activities. This ASU expands an entitys ability to hedge nonfinancial and financial risk components and reduces complexity in fair value hedges of interest rate risk. It eliminates the requirement to separately measure and report hedge ineffectiveness and generally requires the entire change in the fair value of a hedging instrument to be presented in the same income statement line as the hedged item. It also eases certain documentation and assessment requirements and modifies the accounting for components excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness. This ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018 (fiscal 2020), and interims periods within those fiscal years, with early adoption permitted. The new guidance with respect to cash flow and net investment hedge relationships existing on the date of adoption must be applied on a modified retrospective basis, and the new presentation and disclosure requirements must be applied on a prospective basis. The adoption of this ASU is not expected to have a significant impact on Companys results of operations, cash flows or financial position. Presentation of net periodic pension cost and net periodic postretirement benefit cost In March 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-07, Compensation  Retirement Benefits (Topic 715): Improving the Presentation of Net Periodic Pension Cost and Net Periodic Postretirement Benefit Cost. This ASU requires an employer to report the service cost component of net periodic pension cost and net periodic postretirement cost in the same line item in the statement of earnings as other compensation costs arising from services rendered by the related employees during the period. The other net cost components are required to be presented in the statement of earnings separately from the service cost component and outside a subtotal of income from operations. Additionally, the line item used in the statement of earnings to present the other net cost components must be disclosed in the notes to the financial statements. This ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017 (fiscal 2019), and interims periods within those fiscal years, and must be applied on a retrospective basis. The Company is evaluating the effect of adopting this new accounting guidance but does not expect adoption to have a material impact on the Companys results of operations. Restricted cash In November 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-18, Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Restricted Cash. This ASU requires that a statement of cash flows explain the change during the period in the total of cash, cash equivalents, and amounts generally described as restricted cash or restricted cash equivalents. Therefore, amounts generally described as restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents should be included with cash and cash equivalents when reconciling the beginning-of-period and end-of-period total amounts shown on the statement of cash flows. This ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017 (fiscal 2019), and interim periods within those fiscal years, with early adoption permitted. The new guidance must be applied on a retrospective basis. The adoption of this ASU is not expected to have a significant impact on Companys consolidated statement of cash flows. Tax accounting for intra-entity asset transfers In October 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-16, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Intra-Entity Transfers of Assets Other Than Inventory. Topic 740, Income Taxes, prohibits the recognition of current and deferred income taxes for an intra-entity asset transfer until the asset has been sold to an outside party. In addition, interpretations of this guidance have developed in practice for transfers of certain intangible and tangible assets. This prohibition on recognition is an exception to the principle of comprehensive recognition of current and deferred income taxes in GAAP. To more faithfully represent the economics of intra-entity asset transfers, the amendments in this ASU require that entities recognize the income tax consequences of an intra-entity transfer of an asset other than inventory when the transfer occurs. The amendments in this ASU do not change GAAP for the pre-tax effects of an intra-entity asset transfer under Topic 810, Consolidation, or for an intra-entity transfer of inventory. This ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017 (fiscal 2019), including interim periods within those fiscal years, with early adoption permitted. The new guidance must be applied on a modified retrospective basis through a cumulative effect adjustment recognized directly to retained earnings as of the date of adoption. The Company is evaluating the effect of adopting this new accounting guidance. Classification of certain cash receipts and cash payments In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-15, Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments. This ASU addresses the classification of certain specific cash flow issues including debt prepayment or extinguishment costs, settlement of certain debt instruments, contingent consideration payments made after a business combination, proceeds from the settlement of certain insurance claims and distributions received from equity method investees. This ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017 (fiscal 2019), and interim periods within those fiscal years, with early adoption permitted. An entity that elects early adoption must adopt all of the amendments in the same period - 70 - and must be applied on a retrospective basis. The Company is evaluating the effect this ASU will have on its consolidated statement of cash flows. Recognition of breakage for prepaid stored-value products In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-04, Liabilities  Extinguishments of Liabilities (Subtopic 405-20): Recognition of Breakage for Certain Prepaid Stored-Value Products. This ASU addresses diversity in practice related to the derecognition of a prepaid store-value product liability. The ASU amends the guidance on extinguishing financial liabilities for certain prepaid store-value products. If an entity selling prepaid store-value products expects to be entitled to an amount that will not be redeemed, the entity will recognize the expected breakage in proportion to the pattern of rights expected to be exercised by the product holder to the extent that it is probable that a significant reversal of the breakage amount will not subsequently occur. The new guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017 (fiscal 2019), and interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted, including adoption before the effective date of ASU 2015-14, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (described below). The amendments in this ASU should be applied either on a modified retrospective basis by means of a cumulative-effect adjustment recognized directly to retained earnings as of the date of adoption or retrospectively to each period presented. The Company is evaluating the effect the ASU will have on its consolidated financial statements. Leases In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842), which supersedes Topic 840, Leases. This ASU increases the transparency and comparability of organizations by requiring the capitalization of substantially all leases on the balance sheet and disclosures of key information about leasing arrangements. Under this new guidance, at the lease commencement date, a lessee recognizes a right-of-use asset and lease liability, which is initially measured at the present value of the future lease payments. For income statement purposes, a dual model was retained for lessees, requiring leases to be classified as either operating or finance leases. Under the operating lease model, lease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Under the finance lease model, interest on the lease liability is recognized separately from amortization of the right-of-use asset. The new guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018 (fiscal 2020), and interim periods within those fiscal years. In transition, lessees are required to recognize and measure leases at the beginning of the earliest period presented (fiscal 2018) using a modified retrospective approach which includes a number of optional practical expedients that entities may elect to apply. The Company will adopt this ASU on September 1, 2019 (fiscal 2020). The Company has begun evaluating and planning for adoption and implementation of this ASU, including selecting a new lease accounting system, evaluating practical expedient and accounting policy elections, and assessing the overall financial statement impact. This ASU will have a material impact on the Companys financial position. The impact on the Companys results of operations is being evaluated. The impact of this ASU is non-cash in nature and will not affect the Companys cash flows. Classification and measurement of financial instruments In January 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-01, Financial Instruments  Overall (Subtopic 825-10): Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities. This ASU requires equity investments (except those under the equity method of accounting or those that result in the consolidation of an investee) to be measured at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in net income. However, an entity may choose to measure equity investments that do not have readily determinable fair values at cost minus impairment, if any, plus or minus changes resulting from observable price changes in orderly transactions for the identical or a similar investment of the same issuer. This simplifies the impairment assessment of equity investments previous held at cost. Separate presentation of financial assets and liabilities by measurement category is required. This ASU is effective prospectively for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017 (fiscal 2019), and interim periods within those fiscal years. Early application is permitted, for fiscal years or interim periods that have not yet been issued as of the beginning of the fiscal year of adoption. The Company is evaluating the effect of adopting this new accounting guidance but does not expect adoption to have a material impact on the Companys results of operations.  Measurement of inventory In July 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-11, Inventory (Topic 330): Simplifying the Measurement of Inventory. This ASU simplifies current accounting treatments by requiring entities to measure most inventories at the lower of cost and net realizable value rather than using lower of cost or market. This guidance does not apply to inventories measured using last-in, first-out method or the retail inventory method. This ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016 (fiscal 2018), and interim periods within those fiscal years. The Company is adopting this guidance on a prospective basis at the beginning of fiscal 2018 and does not expect adoption will have a material impact on the Companys results of operations, cash flows or financial position. - 71 - Revenue recognition on contracts with customers In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606). This ASU provides a single principles-based revenue recognition model with a five-step analysis of transactions to determine when and how revenue is recognized. The core principle is that a company should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. Subsequently, the FASB has issued additional ASUs which further clarify this guidance and also defer the effective date by one year to fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017 (fiscal 2019), and interim periods within those fiscal years. The Company continues to evaluate the impact this ASU, the related amendments and the interpretive guidance will have on the Companys Consolidated Financial Statements. The Company continues to evaluate the method of adoption. Based on preliminary assessment, the Company believes the impact of adopting the new guidance will not be material to its consolidated financial statements, and that the impact will be limited to immaterial changes to the timing of recognition of revenues related to loyalty programs and gift cards, in addition to disaggregated revenue disclosures. The Company will adopt this ASU on September 1, 2018 (fiscal 2019). 3. Exit and disposal activities On April 8, 2015, the Walgreens Boots Alliance Board of Directors approved a plan to implement a restructuring program (the Cost Transformation Program) as part of an initiative to reduce costs and increase operating efficiencies. The Cost Transformation Program implemented and built on the cost-reduction initiative previously announced by the Company on August 6, 2014 and included plans to close stores across the U.S.; reorganize corporate and field operations; drive operating efficiencies; and streamline information technology and other functions. The actions under the Cost Transformation Program focused primarily on the Retail Pharmacy USA segment, but included activities from all segments. The Company completed the Cost Transformation Program in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017, and over the duration of the program, closed a total of 255 stores. The Company recognized cumulative pre-tax charges to its financial results in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America (GAAP) of $1.8 billion , which were primarily recorded within selling, general and administrative expenses. These charges included $743 million related to asset impairment charges, $665 million in real estate costs and $393 million in severance and other business transition and exit costs. The Company incurred pre-tax charges of $835 million related to the Cost Transformation Program during fiscal 2017. The Company incurred pre-tax charges of $424 million related to the Cost Transformation Program during fiscal 2016. The Company incurred pre-tax charges of $542 million related to the Cost Transformation Program during fiscal 2015. Restructuring charges are recognized as the costs are incurred in accordance with GAAP. Restructuring costs by segment are as follows (in millions): ##TABLE_START  Retail Pharmacy     Fiscal 2017 USA  International  Pharmaceutical Wholesale  Consolidated Asset impairments $  $  $  $ Real estate costs      Severance and other business transition and exit costs    Total restructuring costs $  $  $  $         Fiscal 2016        Asset impairments $  $  $   $ Real estate costs    Severance and other business transition and exit costs    Total restructuring costs $  $  $  $         Fiscal 2015        Asset impairments $  $  $   $ Real estate costs      Severance and other business transition and exit costs     Total restructuring costs $  $  $   $ ##TABLE_END- 72 - The changes in accrued expenses and other liabilities related to the Cost Transformation Program include the following (in millions): ##TABLE_START  Asset impairments  Real estate costs  Severance and other business transition and exit costs  Total Balance at August 31, 2016 $   $  $  $ Restructuring costs    Payments   (99 )  (119 )  (218 ) Other - non cash (295 )      (295 ) Currency translation adjustments      Balance at August 31, 2017 $   $  $  $ ##TABLE_END 4. Leases Initial terms for leased premises in the U.S. are typically 15 to 25 years, followed by additional terms containing renewal options at five -year intervals, and may include rent escalation clauses. Non-U.S. leases are typically for shorter terms and may include cancellation clauses or renewal options. The commencement date of all lease terms is the earlier of the date the Company becomes legally obligated to make rent payments or the date the Company has the right to control the property. The Company recognizes rent expense on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease. In addition to minimum fixed rentals, some leases provide for contingent rentals based upon a portion of sales. The Company continuously evaluates its real estate portfolio in conjunction with its capital needs. The Company has entered into several sale-leaseback transactions. In fiscal 2017 , 2016 and 2015 , the Company recorded proceeds from sale-leaseback transactions of $444 million , $60 million and $867 million , respectively. In other transactions, the Company negotiated fixed rate renewal options which constitute a form of continuing involvement, resulting in the assets remaining on the balance sheet and a corresponding finance lease obligation. Annual minimum rental commitments under all leases having an initial or remaining non-cancelable term of more than one year are shown below (in millions): ##TABLE_START   Finance lease obligation  Capital lease  Operating lease 1  $  $  $ 3,210    3,045    2,844    2,605    2,371 Later    18,736 Total minimum lease payments  $  $ 1,210  $ 32,811 ##TABLE_END1 Includes $ 1,370 million of annual minimum rental commitments on closed locations for which a reserve for facility closings has been recognized The capital and finance lease amounts include $859 million of imputed interest and executory costs. Total minimum lease payments have not been reduced by minimum sublease rentals of $270 million on leases due in the future under noncancelable subleases. The Company provides for future costs related to closed locations. The liability is based on the present value of future rent obligations and other related costs (net of estimated sublease rent) to the first lease option date. In fiscal 2017 , 2016 and 2015 , the Company recorded charges of $394 million , $127 million and $252 million , respectively, for facilities that were closed or relocated under long-term leases, including stores closed through the Companys Cost Transformation Program. These charges are reported in selling, general and administrative expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings. - 73 - The changes in reserve for facility closings and related lease termination charges include the following (in millions): ##TABLE_START    Balance at beginning of period  $  $ Provision for present value of non-cancellable lease payments on closed facilities   Assumptions about future sublease income, terminations and changes in interest rates   (34 ) Interest accretion   Cash payments, net of sublease income  (142 )  (107 ) Balance at end of period  $  $ ##TABLE_ENDThe Company remains secondarily liable on 70 leases. For leases on which the Company remains secondarily liable, the maximum potential undiscounted future payments are $327 million at August 31, 2017 . These lease option dates vary, with some lease terms extending up to 2039. Rental expense, which includes common area maintenance, insurance and taxes, where appropriate, was as follows (in millions): ##TABLE_START     Minimum rentals  $ 3,259  $ 3,355  $ 3,176 Contingent rentals    Less: sublease rental income  (55 )  (49 )  (46 )   $ 3,263  $ 3,366  $ 3,168 ##TABLE_END5. Equity method investments Equity method investments as of August 31, 2017 and 2016 were as follows (in millions, except percentages): ##TABLE_START      Carrying value  Ownership percentage  Carrying value  Ownership percentage AmerisourceBergen  $ 5,024  26%  $ 4,964  24% Others  1,296  8%-50%  1,210  12% - 50% Total  $ 6,320    $ 6,174   ##TABLE_ENDAmerisourceBergen investment As of August 31, 2017 and 2016 , the Company owned 56,854,867 AmerisourceBergen common shares, representing approximately 26% and 24% of the outstanding AmerisourceBergen common stock, respectively. The Company accounts for its equity investment in AmerisourceBergen using the equity method of accounting, with the net earnings attributable to the Companys investment being classified within the operating income of its Pharmaceutical Wholesale segment. Due to the timing and availability of financial information of AmerisourceBergen the Company accounts for this equity method investment on a financial reporting lag of two months. Equity earnings from AmerisourceBergen is reported as a separate line in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings. The level 1 fair market value of the Companys equity investment in AmerisourceBergen common stock at August 31, 2017 is $4.6 billion . The Companys investment in AmerisourceBergen carrying value exceeded its proportionate share of the net assets of AmerisourceBergen by $4.4 billion . This premium of $4.4 billion was recognized as part of the carrying value in the Companys equity investment in AmerisourceBergen. The difference was primarily related to goodwill and the fair value of AmerisourceBergen intangible assets.  Other investments The Companys other equity method investments include its investments in Guangzhou Pharmaceuticals Corporation and Nanjing Pharmaceutical Corporation Limited, the Companys pharmaceutical wholesale investments in China; and the equity method investment retained through the sale of a majority interest in Option Care Inc. in fiscal 2015. The Company reported $8 - 74 - million , $44 million and $24 million of post-tax equity earnings from equity method investments other than AmerisourceBergen and Alliance Boots for fiscal 2017 , 2016 , and 2015 respectively. The Company accounted for its 45% investment in Alliance Boots using the equity method of accounting until December 31, 2014. The Company utilized a three-month reporting lag in recording equity income in Alliance Boots, which was eliminated as of December 31, 2014. The Companys share of Alliance Boots earnings was recorded as equity earnings in Alliance Boots in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings. The Companys investment was recorded as equity investment in Alliance Boots in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.

Acquisitions Acquisition of certain Rite Aid assets On June 28, 2017, the Company entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement with Rite Aid, pursuant to which the Company agreed, subject to the terms and conditions thereof, to acquire 2,186 stores, three distribution centers and related inventory from Rite Aid. On September 19, 2017, the Company announced that it had secured regulatory clearance for an amended and restated asset purchase agreement to purchase 1,932 stores, three distribution centers and related inventory from Rite Aid for $4.375 billion in cash and other consideration. As of the date of this report, the first few Rite Aid stores have been acquired. As at August 31, 2017, the Company has not completed a preliminary analysis to assign fair values to tangible and intangible assets acquired. Ownership of stores is expected to be transferred in phases in fiscal 2018. These transfers remain subject to closing conditions set forth in the Amended and Restated Asset Purchase Agreement. The Company will account for this transaction as a business combination. - 75 - AllianceRx Walgreens Prime On March 31, 2017, Walgreens Boots Alliance and pharmacy benefit manager Prime closed a transaction to form a combined central specialty pharmacy and mail services company AllianceRx Walgreens Prime, as part of a strategic alliance. AllianceRx Walgreens Prime is consolidated by Walgreens Boots Alliance and reported within the Retail Pharmacy USA division in its financial statements. The Company accounted for this acquisition of Primes specialty pharmacy and mail services business as a business combination involving non-cash purchase consideration of $720 million consisting of the issuance of an equity interest in AllianceRx Walgreens Prime. As of August 31, 2017 , the Company had not completed the analysis to determine the fair value of the consideration acquired or to assign fair values to all tangible and intangible assets acquired, and therefore the purchase price allocation has not been completed. The preliminary purchase price allocation will be subject to further refinement and may result in material changes. These changes will primarily relate to the allocation of consideration and the fair value assigned to all tangible and intangible assets acquired and identified. The following table summarizes the consideration for the acquisition and the preliminary amounts of identified assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the date of the transaction (in millions). ##TABLE_START Total consideration $   Identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed  Accounts receivable $ Inventories Property, plant and equipment Intangible assets Trade accounts payable, accrued expenses and other liabilities (91 ) Total identifiable net assets Goodwill $ ##TABLE_ENDThe preliminary identified intangible assets primarily include payer contracts. These contracts are estimated to have a weighted average useful life of 15 years. The preliminary goodwill of $103 million arising from the transaction consists of expected purchasing synergies, operating efficiencies by benchmarking performance and applying best practices across the combined company, consolidation of operations, reductions in selling, general and administrative expenses and combining workforces. Substantially all of the goodwill recognized is not expected to be deductible for income tax purposes. In accordance with ASC Topic 810, Consolidation, the noncontrolling interest was recognized based on its proportionate interest in the identifiable net assets of AllianceRx Walgreens Prime. The difference between the carrying amount of the noncontrolling interest and the fair value recognized as consideration in the business combination is recognized as additional paid in capital. The Company incurred legal, professional services, and other costs related to the transaction, which were included in selling, general and administrative expenses, of $14 million in fiscal 2017. Pro forma net earnings and sales of the Company, assuming the acquisition had occurred at the beginning of each period presented, would not be materially different from the results reported. The acquisition did not have a material impact on net earnings or sales of the Company for fiscal 2017 . Alliance Boots The Second Step Transaction closed on December 31, 2014, resulting in the acquisition by the Company of 55% of the issued and outstanding share capital of Alliance Boots, increasing its interest to 100% . The Company previously accounted for its 45% interest in Alliance Boots as an equity method investment. As a result of the closing of the Second Step Transaction, the Company increased its ownership in WBAD, a global sourcing enterprise between Walgreens and Alliance Boots, to 100% . Because Walgreens held, prior to the Second Step Transaction, a 50% direct interest and an additional indirect interest in WBAD through its 45% ownership of Alliance Boots, the financial results of WBAD were fully consolidated into the Walgreens financial statements with the remaining 27.5% effective interest being recorded as a noncontrolling interest. The acquisition of the 27.5% noncontrolling interest was accounted for as an equity transaction with no gain or loss recorded in the statement of earnings under ASC Topic 805, Business Combinations. - 76 - On January 1, 2015, WBAD Holdings Limited sold 320 common shares of WBAD, representing approximately 5% of the equity interests in WBAD, to Alliance Healthcare Italia Distribuzione S.p.A. (AHID), which is not a member of the Companys consolidated group. Under certain circumstances, AHID has the right to put, and WBAD Holdings Limited has the right to call, the 320 common shares of WBAD currently owned by AHID for a purchase price of $100,000 . The Company has completed the purchase accounting of the Second Step Transaction. The total purchase price of the Second Step Transaction of $15.9 billion included 3.133 billion in cash ( $4.9 billion at the December 31, 2014 spot rate of $1.56 to 1.00 ) and 144.3 million of the Companys common shares at a fair value of $11.0 billion (based on the December 30, 2014 closing market price of $76.05 ). Of the total purchase price, $13.3 billion was allocated to acquire the 55% ownership interest in Alliance Boots and $2.6 billion was allocated to acquire the noncontrolling interest in WBAD. The purchase price attributed to the acquisition of the noncontrolling interest in WBAD was determined based on the relative fair value of Alliance Boots and WBAD, respectively. The impact of the equity transaction is as follows (in millions): ##TABLE_START  Amount Consideration attributed to WBAD $ 2,559 Less: carrying value of the Companys pre-existing noncontrolling interest Impact to additional paid in capital 2,429 ##TABLE_ENDThe following table summarizes the consideration paid to acquire the remaining 55% interest in Alliance Boots and the amounts of identified assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the date of the Second Step Transaction (in millions). ##TABLE_START Consideration paid  Cash $ 4,874 Common stock 10,977 Total consideration transferred 15,851 Less: consideration attributed to WBAD (2,559 )  13,292 Fair value of the investment in Alliance Boots held before the Second Step Transaction 8,149 Total consideration $ 21,441   Identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed including noncontrolling interests  Cash and cash equivalents $ Accounts receivable 3,799 Inventories 3,713 Other current assets Property, plant and equipment 3,806 Intangible assets 11,691 Other non-current assets 2,217 Trade accounts payable, accrued expenses and other liabilities (7,696 ) Borrowings (9,010 ) Deferred income taxes (2,452 ) Other non-current liabilities (383 ) Noncontrolling interests (412 ) Total identifiable net assets and noncontrolling interests 6,580 Goodwill $ 14,861 ##TABLE_END- 77 - As a result of the Company acquiring the remaining 55% interest in Alliance Boots, the Companys previously held 45% interest was re-measured at fair value, resulting in a gain of $563 million . The gain has been recognized as Gain on previously held equity interest in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2015. The fair value of the previously held equity interest of $8.1 billion in Alliance Boots was determined using the income approach methodology. The fair value for trade names and trademarks was determined using the relief from royalty method of the income approach; pharmacy licenses and customer relationships were determined using the excess earnings method of the income approach; and loyalty card holders were determined using the incremental cash flow method, which is a form of the income approach. Personal property fair values were determined primarily using the indirect cost approach, while real property fair values were determined using the income, market and/or cost approach. The fair value measurements of the previously held equity interest and intangible assets are based on significant inputs not observable in the market, and thus represent Level 3 measurements. The fair value estimates for the previously held equity interest and intangible assets are based on (i) projected discounted cash flows, (ii) historical and projected financial information, (iii) synergies including cost savings, and (iv) attrition rates, as relevant, that market participants would consider when estimating fair values. The identified definite and indefinite lived intangible assets were as follows: ##TABLE_START Definite-lived intangible assets Weighted-average useful life (in years) Amount (in millions) Customer relationships $ 1,311 Loyalty card holders 742 Trade names and trademarks 399 Favorable lease interests 93 Total  $ 2,545    Indefinite-lived intangible assets  Amount (in millions) Trade names and trademarks  $ 6,657 Pharmacy licenses  2,489 Total  $ 9,146 ##TABLE_ENDThe goodwill of $14.9 billion arising from the Second Step Transaction primarily reflects the expected purchasing synergies, operating efficiencies by benchmarking performance and applying best practices across the Company, consolidation of operations, reductions in selling, general and administrative expenses and combining workforces. Following the completion of the Second Step Transaction, the Company realigned its operations into three reportable segments: Retail Pharmacy USA, Retail Pharmacy International and Pharmaceutical Wholesale. The Company determined that the goodwill should be allocated across all segments recognizing that each segment will benefit from the expected synergies. The goodwill allocated to the Retail Pharmacy USA segment of $7.3 billion is comprised of $3.5 billion of synergy benefits allocable to the segment on a source of procurement benefit basis and $3.8 billion determined on a with-and-without basis. The source of procurement benefit basis allocates the synergy benefits to the segment whose purchase gave rise to the benefit. The with-and-without basis computes the difference between the fair value of the pre-existing business before the combination and its fair value after the combination. Of the remaining goodwill, $3.9 billion was allocated to the Retail Pharmacy International segment and $3.7 billion was allocated to the Pharmaceutical Wholesale segment. Substantially all of the goodwill recognized is not expected to be deductible for income tax purposes. The Company incurred legal and other professional services costs related to the Second Step Transaction, which were included in selling, general and administrative expenses, of $87 million in fiscal 2015. The fair value of the assets acquired includes inventory having an estimated fair value of $3.7 billion . This fair value includes a $106 million fair value adjustment to capitalize the estimated profit in acquired finished goods inventory as of the date of the Second Step Transaction, which was expensed to cost of sales over the first inventory turn. - 78 - The following table presents supplemental unaudited condensed pro forma consolidated information for 2015 and 2014 as if the Second Step Transaction had occurred on September 1, 2013, the first day of the Companys fiscal 2014. The unaudited condensed pro forma information reflect certain adjustments related to past operating performance and acquisition accounting adjustments, such as increased amortization expense based on the fair valuation of assets acquired, the impact of acquisition financing, transaction costs and the related income tax effects. The unaudited condensed pro forma information does not include any anticipated synergies that may be achievable subsequent to the date of the Second Step Transaction. The unaudited condensed pro forma information also excludes certain non-recurring items such as transaction related costs. Accordingly, the unaudited condensed pro forma information has been prepared for comparative purposes only and is not intended to be indicative of what the Companys results would have been had the Second Step Transaction occurred at the beginning of the periods presented or the results which may occur in the future. ##TABLE_START  Year ended Year ended (in millions, except per share amounts) August 31, 2015 August 31, 2014 Sales $ 116,491 $ 113,896 Net earnings 4,278 3,884    Net earnings per common share:   Basic $ 4.10 $ 3.54 Diluted 4.06 3.50 ##TABLE_ENDActual results from Alliance Boots operations included in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings since December 31, 2014, the date of the Second Step Transaction, are as follows (in millions, except per share amounts): ##TABLE_START   Year ended (in millions, except per share amounts)  August 31, 2015 Sales  $ 22,470 Net earnings     Net earnings per common share:   Basic  $ 0.82 Diluted  0.81 ##TABLE_END7. Goodwill and other intangible assets Goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets are evaluated for impairment annually during the fourth quarter, or more frequently if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value. As part of the Companys impairment analysis, we determined fair value for each reporting unit using both the income and market approaches. The income approach requires management to estimate a number of factors for each reporting unit, including projected future operating results, economic projections, anticipated future cash flows and discount rates. The market approach estimates fair value using comparable marketplace fair value data from within a comparable industry grouping. Based on the results of our testing, the fair values of each of the reporting units and other indefinite-lived intangible assets exceeded their carrying values, therefore, no impairment was recognized.  The determination of the fair value of the reporting units and the allocation of that value to individual assets and liabilities within those reporting units requires the Company to make significant estimates and assumptions. These estimates and assumptions primarily include but are not limited to: the selection of appropriate peer group companies; control premiums appropriate for acquisitions in the industries in which the Company competes; the discount rate; terminal growth rates; and forecasts of revenue, operating income, depreciation and amortization and capital expenditures. The allocation requires analyses to determine the fair value of assets and liabilities including, among other things, trade names and trademarks, pharmacy licenses, customer relationships and purchased prescription files. Although the Company believes its estimates of fair value are reasonable, actual financial results could differ from those estimates due to the inherent uncertainty involved in making such estimates. Changes in assumptions concerning future financial results or other underlying assumptions could have a significant impact on either the fair value of the reporting units, the amount of the goodwill impairment charge, or both. - 79 - Our reporting units fair values exceeded their carrying amounts ranging from 9% to more than 400% . The determination of the fair value of the reporting units requires us to make significant estimates and assumptions. Due to the negative impact of reductions in pharmacy funding in the United Kingdom, the fair value of our Boots reporting unit, within our Retail Pharmacy International division, was impacted and is in excess of its carrying value by approximately 9% . The goodwill of the Boots reporting unit is not currently impaired and we will continue to monitor the U.K. industry trends and the impact it may have on the business. Changes in the carrying amount of goodwill by reportable segment consist of the following activity (in millions):  ##TABLE_START   Retail Pharmacy USA  Retail Pharmacy International  Pharmaceutical Wholesale  Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc.

On January 27, 2017, each of the Bridge Credit Agreement, the 2015 Term Loan Credit Agreement, and the 2016 Term Loan Credit Agreement terminated in accordance with its terms. $6.0 billion note issuance On June 1, 2016, Walgreens Boots Alliance received net proceeds (after deducting underwriting discounts and offering expenses) of $6.0 billion from a public offering of five series of U.S. dollar notes with varying maturities and interest rates. Total issuance costs relating to the notes, including underwriting discounts and offering expenses, were $30 million . Because the merger with Rite Aid was not consummated on or prior to June 1, 2017, the 2018 notes, the 2021 notes and the 2023 notes were redeemed on June 5, 2017 under the special mandatory redemption terms of the indenture governing such notes. Walgreens Boots Alliance was required to redeem all of the 2018 notes, the 2021 notes and the 2023 notes then outstanding, at a special mandatory redemption price equal to 101% of the aggregate principal amount of such notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest of approximately $1 million to, but excluding, the date of redemption. The 2026 notes and 2046 notes remain outstanding in accordance with their respective terms and are subject to redemption in certain circumstances. Backstop Commitment Letter, Backstop Credit Agreement and 2017 Term Loan Credit Agreements In connection with Amendment No. 1 to the Merger Agreement, on January 31, 2017, the Company entered into (i) a $5.0 billion backstop facility commitment letter (the Backstop Commitment Letter) and (ii) a $5.0 billion unsecured bridge term loan facility (the Backstop Credit Agreement). Upon entry into the Backstop Credit Agreement, the Backstop Commitment Letter and the commitments contemplated thereby terminated. On February 22, 2017, the Company entered into (a) a $4.8 billion unsecured term loan facility with the lenders party thereto (the Syndicated Credit Agreement) and (b) a $1.0 billion unsecured term loan facility with Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation (the Sumitomo Credit Agreement and, together with the Syndicated Credit Agreement, the February 2017 Term Loan Credit Agreements). Upon entry into the February 2017 Term Loan Credit Agreements, the commitments available under the Backstop Credit Agreement were reduced to zero and such agreement terminated in accordance with its terms. Each of the February 2017 Term Loan Credit Agreements and the commitments contemplated thereby terminated on June 28, 2017 upon the termination of the Merger Agreement. February 2017 Revolving Credit Agreement On February 1, 2017, the Company entered into a $1.0 billion revolving credit facility (as amended, the February 2017 Revolving Credit Agreement) with the lenders from time to time party thereto and, on August 1, 2017, the Company entered into an amendment agreement thereto. The terms and conditions of the February 2017 Revolving Credit Agreement were unchanged by the amendment other than the extension of the facility termination date to the earlier of (a) January 31, 2019 and - 83 - (b) the date of termination in whole of the aggregate commitments provided by the lenders thereunder. As of August 31, 2017, there were no borrowings under the February 2017 Revolving Credit Agreement. August 2017 Credit Agreements On August 24, 2017, the Company entered into a $1.0 billion revolving credit agreement (the August 2017 Revolving Credit Agreement) with the lenders from time to time party thereto and a $1.0 billion term loan credit agreement (the 2017 Term Loan Credit Agreement and together with the August 2017 Revolving Credit Agreement, the August 2017 Credit Agreements) with Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation. The August 2017 Revolving Credit Agreement is an unsecured revolving credit facility with a facility termination date of the earlier of (a) January 31, 2019, subject to any extension thereof pursuant to the terms of the August 2017 Revolving Credit Agreement and (b) the date of termination in whole of the aggregate commitments provided by the lenders thereunder. The 2017 Term Loan Credit Agreement is an unsecured multi-draw term loan facility maturing on March 30, 2019. The aggregate commitments of Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation under the 2017 Term Loan Credit Agreement are initially equal to $1.0 billion , which shall be reduced on June 1, 2018 to the lesser of $500 million and the aggregate remaining undrawn commitments thereunder. Any remaining undrawn commitments thereunder and the ability of the Company to request loans under such commitments shall terminate on September 1, 2018. As of August 31, 2017, there were no borrowings under either of the August 2017 Credit Agreements. Repayment of notes On May 18, 2016, the Company repaid $750 million floating rate notes due 2016 on their maturity date and on August 28, 2017, the Company redeemed, at its option, $750 million  1.750% notes due 2017. The floating rate notes due 2016 and the 1.750% notes due 2017 were issued in a public offering on November 18, 2014. Repayment of term loan  On August 30, 2017, Walgreens Boots Alliance used available cash to repay in full all outstanding loans and obligations under a term loan credit agreement entered into by Walgreens Boots Alliance and Walgreens on November 10, 2014, which, as of the date of repayment, consisted of the remaining unamortized amount of 1.41 billion ( $1.83 billion at the August 31, 2017 spot rate of $1.295 to 1) aggregate principal amount of outstanding loans together with accrued interest thereon through, but excluding, the payment date, and such other amounts required to be paid by Walgreens Boots Alliance thereunder and the 2014 Term Loan Agreement terminated in accordance with its terms. Debt covenants Each of the Companys credit facilities contain a covenant to maintain, as of the last day of each fiscal quarter, a ratio of consolidated debt to total capitalization not to exceed 0.60 : 1.00 . The credit facilities contain various other customary covenants. In the case of the 2017 Term Loan Credit Agreement, such covenants are only effective after the date of initial funding. Other borrowings The Company periodically borrows under its commercial paper program and may borrow under it in future periods. There were no commercial paper borrowings outstanding as of August 31, 2017 or 2016. The Company did not issue any commercial paper under its commercial paper program in fiscal 2017. The Company had average daily short-term borrowings of $14 million of commercial paper outstanding at a weighted average interest rate of 0.66% in fiscal 2016 .  Interest Interest paid, which is net of capitalized interest, was $643 million in fiscal 2017 , $580 million in fiscal 2016 and $472 million in fiscal 2015 . Interest capitalized during fiscal 2017 , 2016 and 2015 was immaterial. 9. Financial instruments The Company uses derivative instruments to manage its exposure to interest rate and foreign currency exchange risks. The notional amounts, fair value and balance sheet presentation of derivative instruments outstanding as of August 31, 2017 and 2016 were as follows (in millions): - 84 - ##TABLE_START 2017  Notional 1  Fair value  Location in Consolidated Balance Sheets Derivatives designated as hedges :       Interest rate swaps  $ $   Other non-current assets Foreign currency forwards     Other current assets Derivatives not designated as hedges :       Foreign currency forwards    Other current assets Foreign currency forwards  2,816  Other current liabilities ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START 1  Amounts are presented in U.S. dollar equivalents, as applicable. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START 2016  Notional 1  Fair value  Location in Consolidated Balance Sheets Derivatives designated as hedges :       Interest rate swaps  $  $  Other non-current assets Derivatives not designated as hedges :       Foreign currency forwards  1,177   Other current assets Foreign currency forwards     Other current liabilities Basis swap    Other current liabilities ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START 1  Amounts are presented in U.S. dollar equivalents, as applicable. ##TABLE_END The Company uses interest rate swaps to manage the interest rate exposure associated with some of its fixed-rate borrowings and designates them as fair value hedges. The Company uses forward starting interest rates swaps to hedge its interest rate exposure of some of its anticipated debt issuance. The Company utilizes foreign currency forward contracts and other foreign currency derivatives to hedge significant committed and highly probable future transactions and cash flows denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the Company or its subsidiaries. The Company has significant non-US dollar denominated net investments and uses foreign currency denominated financial instruments, specifically foreign currency derivatives and foreign currency denominated debt, to hedge its foreign currency risk. Fair value hedges The Company holds interest rate swap converting $250 million of its 5.250% fixed rate notes to a floating interest rate based on the six-month LIBOR in arrears plus a constant spread. All swap termination dates coincide with the notes maturity date, January 15, 2019. These swaps were designated as fair value hedges. The gains and losses due to changes in fair value on the swaps and on the hedged notes attributable to interest rate risk did not have a material impact on the Companys Financial Statements. The changes in fair value of the Companys debt that was swapped from fixed to variable rate and designated as fair value hedges are included in long-term debt on the Consolidated Balance Sheets (see note 8, borrowings). No material gain or losses were recorded for ineffectiveness during fiscal 2017, 2016, or 2015. Derivatives not designated as hedges The Company enters into derivative transactions that are not designated as accounting hedges. These derivative instruments are economic hedges of interest rate and foreign currency risks. The gains and (losses) due to changes in fair value of these derivative instruments were recognized in earnings as follows (in millions): ##TABLE_START   Location in Consolidated Statements of Earnings     Interest rate swaps  Interest expense, net  $   $   $  Foreign currency forwards  Selling, general and administrative expense     Second Step Transaction foreign currency forwards  Other income (expense)      (166 )  Foreign currency forwards  Other income (expense)  (48 )  (12 )   ##TABLE_END- 85 - Warrants On March 18, 2016, the Company exercised warrants to purchase 22,696,912 shares of AmerisourceBergen common stock at an exercise price of $51.50 per share for an aggregate exercise price payment of $1.17 billion . On August 25, 2016, the Company exercised additional warrants to purchase 22,696,912 shares of AmerisourceBergen common stock at an exercise price of $52.50 per share for an aggregate exercise price payment of $1.19 billion . See note 5, equity method investments for further information. The Company reported its warrants at fair value. The gains and losses due to changes in fair value of the warrants recognized in earnings were as follows (in millions): ##TABLE_START   Location in Consolidated Statements of Earnings     Warrants  Other income (expense)  $   $ (546 )  $  ##TABLE_ENDThe Company held no warrants to purchase AmerisourceBergen common stock on August 31, 2017 and 2016 . Derivatives credit risk Counterparties to derivative financial instruments expose the Company to credit-related losses in the event of counterparty nonperformance, and the Company regularly monitors the credit worthiness of each counterparty. Derivatives offsetting The Company does not offset the fair value amounts of derivative instruments subject to master netting agreements in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. 10. Fair value measurements The Company measures certain assets and liabilities in accordance with ASC Topic 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures, which defines fair value as the price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. In addition, it establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes observable and unobservable inputs used to measure fair value into three broad levels: ##TABLE_START Level 1 - Quoted prices in active markets that are accessible at the measurement date for identical assets and liabilities. The fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to Level 1 inputs. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START Level 2 - Observable inputs other than quoted prices in active markets. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START Level 3 - Unobservable inputs for which there is little or no market data available. The fair value hierarchy gives the lowest priority to Level 3 inputs. ##TABLE_END Assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis were as follows (in millions): ##TABLE_START   August 31, 2017  Level 1  Level 2  Level 3 Assets :         Money market funds 1  $ 2,096  $ 2,096  $   $  Available-for-sale investments 2       Liabilities :         Foreign currency forwards 3       ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START   August 31, 2016  Level 1  Level 2  Level 3 Assets :         Money market funds 1  $ 9,133  $ 9,133  $   $  Available-for-sale investments 2       Foreign currency forwards 3       Interest rate swaps 4       Liabilities:         Basis swaps 3       ##TABLE_END- 86 - ##TABLE_START 1  Money market funds are valued at the closing price reported by the fund sponsor. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START 2  Fair values of quoted investments are based on current bid prices as of the balance sheet dates. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START 3  The fair value of basis swaps and forward currency contracts is estimated by discounting the difference between the contractual forward price and the current available forward price for the residual maturity of the contract using observable market rates. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START 4  The fair value of interest rate swaps is calculated by discounting the estimated future cash flows based on the applicable observable yield curves. See note 9, financial instruments for additional information. ##TABLE_END There were no transfers between levels in fiscal 2017 or 2016 . The Company reports its debt instruments under the guidance of ASC Topic 825, Financial Instruments, which requires disclosure of the fair value of the Companys debt in the footnotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Unless otherwise noted, the fair value for all notes was determined based upon quoted market prices and therefore categorized as Level 1. See note 8, borrowings for further information. The carrying values of accounts receivable and trade accounts payable approximated their respective fair values due to their short-term nature. 11. Commitments and contingencies The Company is involved in legal proceedings and is subject to investigations, inspections, audits, inquiries and similar actions by governmental authorities, arising in the normal course of the Companys business, including the matters described below. Legal proceedings, in general, and securities and class action litigation, in particular, can be expensive and disruptive. Some of these suits may purport or may be determined to be class actions and/or involve parties seeking large and/or indeterminate amounts, including punitive or exemplary damages, and may remain unresolved for several years. From time to time, the Company is also involved in legal proceedings as a plaintiff involving antitrust, tax, contract, intellectual property and other matters. Gain contingencies, if any, are recognized when they are realized. The results of legal proceedings are often uncertain and difficult to predict, and the costs incurred in litigation can be substantial, regardless of the outcome. The Company believes that its defenses and assertions in pending legal proceedings have merit, and does not believe that any of these pending matters, after consideration of applicable reserves and rights to indemnification, will have a material adverse effect on the Companys consolidated financial position. However, substantial unanticipated verdicts, fines and rulings do sometimes occur. As a result, the Company could from time to time incur judgments, enter into settlements or revise its expectations regarding the outcome of certain matters, and such developments could have a material adverse effect on its results of operations in the period in which the amounts are accrued and/or its cash flows in the period in which the amounts are paid. On a quarterly basis, the Company assesses its liabilities and contingencies for outstanding legal proceedings and reserves are established on a case-by-case basis for those legal claims for which management concludes that it is probable that a loss will be incurred and that the amount of such loss can be reasonably estimated. Substantially all of these contingencies are subject to significant uncertainties and, therefore, determining the likelihood of a loss and/or the measurement of any loss can be complex. With respect to litigation and other legal proceedings where the Company has determined that a loss is reasonably possible, the Company is unable to estimate the amount or range of reasonably possible loss due to the inherent difficulty of predicting the outcome of and uncertainties regarding such litigation and legal proceedings. The Companys assessments are based on estimates and assumptions that have been deemed reasonable by management, but that may prove to be incomplete or inaccurate, and unanticipated events and circumstances may occur that might cause the Company to change those estimates and assumptions. Therefore, it is possible that an unfavorable resolution of one or more pending litigation or other contingencies could have a material adverse effect on the Companys consolidated financial statements in a future fiscal period. Managements assessment of current litigation and other legal proceedings, including the corresponding accruals, could change because of the discovery of facts with respect to legal actions or other proceedings pending against the Company which are not presently known. Adverse rulings or determinations by judges, juries, governmental authorities or other parties could also result in changes to managements assessment of current liabilities and contingencies. Accordingly, the ultimate costs of resolving these claims may be substantially higher or lower than the amounts reserved. On December 29, 2014, a putative shareholder filed a derivative action in federal court in the Northern District of Illinois against certain current and former directors and officers of Walgreen Co., and Walgreen Co. as a nominal defendant, arising out of certain public statements the Company made regarding its former fiscal 2016 goals. The action asserts claims for breach of fiduciary duty, waste and unjust enrichment. On April 10, 2015, the defendants filed a motion to dismiss. On May 18, 2015, the case was stayed in light of a securities class action that was filed on April 10, 2015. After a ruling issued on September 30, 2016 in the securities class action, which is described below, on November 3, 2016, the Court entered a stipulation and order extending the stay until the securities case is fully resolved. On April 10, 2015, a putative shareholder filed a securities class action in federal court in the Northern District of Illinois against Walgreen Co. and certain former officers of Walgreen Co. The action asserts claims for violation of the federal - 87 - securities laws arising out of certain public statements the Company made regarding its former fiscal 2016 goals. On June 16, 2015, the Court entered an order appointing a lead plaintiff. Pursuant to the Courts order, lead plaintiff filed an amended complaint on August 17, 2015, and defendants moved to dismiss the amended complaint on October 16, 2015. Lead plaintiff filed a response to the motion to dismiss on December 22, 2015, and defendants filed a reply in support of the motion on February 5, 2016. On September 30, 2016, the Court issued an order granting in part and denying in part defendants motion to dismiss. Defendants filed their answer to the amended complaint on November 4, 2016 and filed an amended answer on January 16, 2017. Plaintiffs filed their motion for class certification on April 21, 2017. As of August 31, 2017, the Company was aware of two putative class action lawsuits filed by purported Rite Aid stockholders against Rite Aid and its board of directors, Walgreens Boots Alliance and Victoria Merger Sub, Inc. for claims arising out of the transactions contemplated by the original Merger Agreement (prior to its amendment on January 29, 2017) (such transactions, the Rite Aid Transactions). One Rite Aid action was filed in the State of Pennsylvania in the Court of Common Pleas of Cumberland County (the Pennsylvania action), and one action was filed in the United States District Court for the Middle District of Pennsylvania (the federal action). The Pennsylvania action primarily alleged that the Rite Aid board of directors breached its fiduciary duties in connection with the Rite Aid Transactions by, among other things, agreeing to an unfair and inadequate price, agreeing to deal protection devices that preclude other bidders from making successful competing offers for Rite Aid, and failing to disclose all allegedly material information concerning the proposed merger, and also alleged that Walgreens Boots Alliance and Victoria Merger Sub, Inc. aided and abetted these alleged breaches of fiduciary duty. The federal action alleged, among other things, that Rite Aid and its board of directors disseminated an allegedly false and misleading proxy statement in connection with the Rite Aid Transactions. The plaintiffs in the federal action also filed a motion for preliminary injunction seeking to enjoin the Rite Aid shareholder vote relating to the Rite Aid Transactions. That motion was denied and plaintiffs agreed to stay the litigation until after the Rite Aid Transactions closed. On March 17, 2017, plaintiffs moved to lift the stay to allow plaintiffs to file an amended complaint. On August 4, 2017, that motion was granted for the limited purpose of allowing plaintiffs to file a motion seeking leave to amend their complaint in light of the termination of the Merger Agreement. Plaintiffs filed such a motion on September 22, 2017. The Company filed its response on October 6, 2017. Plaintiffs filed their reply, and the motion is fully briefed. The court has not set a hearing date or indicated when it will issue a ruling. The Company was also named as a defendant in eight putative class action lawsuits filed in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware (the Delaware actions). Those actions were consolidated, and plaintiffs filed a motion for preliminary injunction seeking to enjoin the Rite Aid shareholder vote relating to the Rite Aid Transactions. That motion was denied and the plaintiffs in the Delaware actions agreed to settle this matter for an immaterial amount. The Delaware actions all have been dismissed.  12. Income taxes The components of Earnings Before Income Tax Provision were (in millions): ##TABLE_START     U.S.  $ 1,953  $ 2,577  $ 2,725 NonU.S.  2,900  2,567  2,586 Total  $ 4,853  $ 5,144  $ 5,311 ##TABLE_ENDThe provision for income taxes consists of the following (in millions):  - 88 - ##TABLE_START     Current provision       Federal  $  $  $ State    NonU.S.      1,194  1,426  1,095 Deferred provision       Federal  (306 )  (183 )  (23 ) State  (24 )   (16 ) NonU.S.  tax law change  (80 )  (182 )   NonU.S.  excluding tax law change  (24 )  (70 )     (434 )  (429 )  (39 ) Income tax provision  $  $  $ 1,056 ##TABLE_END The difference between the statutory federal income tax rate and the effective tax rate is as follows: ##TABLE_START     Federal statutory rate  35.0 %  35.0 %  35.0 % State income taxes, net of federal benefit  0.3  0.8  1.3 Deferred tax asset recognition 1      (4.1 ) Gain on previously held equity interest      (5.8 ) Foreign income taxed at non-U.S. rates  (11.8 )  (7.8 )  (6.2 ) Non-taxable income  (5.3 )  (4.4 )  (2.6 ) Non-deductible expenses  1.5  1.1  2.3 Tax law changes  (1.6 )  (3.5 )   Tax credits  (2.9 )  (1.5 )   Other  0.5  (0.3 )   Effective income tax rate  15.7 %  19.4 %  19.9 % ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START 1  Upon the amendment and immediate exercise of the call option to acquire the remaining 55% ownership of Alliance Boots, the Company was required to compare the fair value of the amended option with the book value of the original option with a gain or loss recognized for the difference. The fair value of the amended option resulted in a financial statement loss of $866 million . The loss on the Alliance Boots call option was, in part, a capital loss and available to be carried forward and offset future capital gains through fiscal 2020. In 2015, the deferred tax asset related to the loss was recognized, resulting in the 4.1% effective tax rate benefit reported in the table above. ##TABLE_END The deferred tax assets and liabilities included in the Consolidated Balance Sheets consist of the following (in millions): - 89 - ##TABLE_START    Deferred tax assets     Postretirement benefits  $  $ Compensation and benefits   Insurance   Accrued rent   Outside basis difference   Allowance for doubtful accounts   Tax attributes   Stock compensation   Deferred income   Other     1,670  1,653 Less: valuation allowance   Total deferred tax assets  1,262  1,348 Deferred tax liabilities     Accelerated depreciation   1,205 Inventory   Intangible assets  1,277  1,418 Equity method investment  1,002  Deferred income       3,536  3,989 Net deferred tax liabilities  $ 2,274  $ 2,641 ##TABLE_ENDAt August 31, 2017 , the Company has recorded deferred tax assets of $555 million , primarily reflecting the benefit of $423 million in U.S. federal, $212 million in state and $1.2 billion in non-U.S. ordinary and capital losses. In addition, these deferred tax assets include $91 million of income tax credits. Of these deferred tax assets, $253 million will expire at various dates from 2018 through 2037. The residual deferred tax assets of $302 million have no expiry date. The Company believes it is more likely than not that the benefit from certain deferred tax assets will not be realized. In recognition of this risk, the Company has recorded a valuation allowance of $408 million against those deferred tax assets as of August 31, 2017 . Income taxes paid were $1.1 billion , $1.1 billion and $1.3 billion for fiscal years 2017 , 2016 and 2015 , respectively. ASC Topic 740, Income Taxes, provides guidance regarding the recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure in the financial statement of tax positions taken or expected to be taken on a tax return, including the decision whether to file in a particular jurisdiction. As of August 31, 2017 , unrecognized tax benefits of $250 million were reported as long-term liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets while $202 million were reported as current tax liabilities. Both of these amounts include interest and penalties, when applicable. The following table provides a reconciliation of the total amounts of unrecognized tax benefits (in millions): - 90 - ##TABLE_START     Balance at beginning of year  $  $  $ Gross increases related to business combination      Gross increases related to tax positions in a prior period    Gross decreases related to tax positions in a prior period  (36 )  (47 )  (75 ) Gross increases related to tax positions in the current period    Settlements with taxing authorities  (2 )  (17 )  (45 ) Currency  (1 )  (11 )   Lapse of statute of limitations  (5 )  (6 )  (4 ) Balance at end of year  $  $  $ ##TABLE_ENDAt August 31, 2017 , 2016 and 2015 , $286 million , $237 million and $227 million , respectively, of unrecognized tax benefits would favorably impact the effective tax rate if recognized. During the next twelve months, based on current knowledge, it is reasonably possible the amount of unrecognized tax benefits could decrease by up to $140 million due to anticipated tax audit settlements and the expirations of statutes of limitations associated with tax positions related to multiple tax jurisdictions. The Company recognizes interest and penalties in the income tax provision in its Consolidated Statements of Earnings. At August 31, 2017 , and August 31, 2016 , the Company had accrued interest and penalties of $43 million and $34 million , respectively. For the year ended August 31, 2017 , the amount reported in income tax expense related to interest and penalties was $9 million .  The Company files a consolidated U.S. federal income tax return as well as income tax returns in various states and multiple foreign jurisdictions. It is generally no longer under audit examination for U.S. federal income tax purposes for any years prior to fiscal 2015. With few exceptions, it is no longer subject to state and local income tax examinations by tax authorities for years before fiscal 2007. In foreign tax jurisdictions, the Company is generally no longer subject to examination by the tax authorities in Luxembourg prior to 2011, in Germany prior to 2011, in France prior to 2011 and in Turkey prior to 2011. With respect to the United Kingdom, a number of specific issues remain open to examination by the tax authorities back to 2000.  The Company has received tax holidays from Swiss cantonal income taxes relative to certain of its Swiss operations. The income tax holidays are expected to extend through September 2022. The holidays had a beneficial impact of $142 million and $116 million during fiscal 2017 and 2016 , respectively. This benefit is primarily included as part of the foreign income taxed at non-U.S. rates line in the effective tax rate reconciliation table above. At August 31, 2017 , it is not practicable for the Company to determine the amount of the unrecognized deferred tax liability it has with respect to temporary differences related to investments in foreign subsidiaries and foreign corporate joint ventures that are essentially permanent in duration. 13. Stock compensation plans The Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. Omnibus Incentive Plan (the Omnibus Plan) which became effective in fiscal 2013, provides for incentive compensation to the Companys non-employee directors, officers and employees, and consolidates several previously existing equity compensation plans into a single plan. The Company grants stock options, performance shares and restricted units under the Omnibus Plan. Performance shares issued under the Omnibus Plan offer performance-based incentive awards and equity-based awards to key employees. The fair value of each performance share granted assumes that performance goals will be achieved at 100 percent . If such goals are not met, no compensation expense is recognized and any recognized compensation expense is reversed. Restricted stock units are also equity-based awards with performance requirements that are granted to key employees. The performance shares and restricted stock unit awards are both subject to restrictions as to continuous employment except in the case of death, normal retirement or total and permanent disability.  Total stock-based compensation expense for fiscal 2017 , 2016 and 2015 was $91 million , $115 million and $109 million , respectively. The recognized tax benefit was $78 million , $21 million and $7 million for fiscal 2017 , 2016 and 2015 , respectively. Unrecognized compensation cost related to non-vested awards at August 31, 2017 was $137 million . This cost is expected to be recognized over three years . - 91 - 14. Retirement benefits The Company sponsors several retirement plans, including defined benefit plans, defined contribution plans and a postretirement health plan. Pursuant to the Second Step Transaction, the Company assumed a number of retirement benefit plans in the United Kingdom and other countries. The Company valued the assumed pension assets and liabilities on the acquisition date and uses an August 31 annual measurement date for its pension and post-retirement plans. On September 1, 2016, for U.K. and U.S. benefit plans using the yield curve approach, the Company changed the method used to calculate the service cost and interest cost components of net periodic benefit costs for pension and postretirement benefit plans and measures these costs by applying the specific spot rates along the yield curve to the plans projected cash flows. The Company believes this approach provides a more precise measurement of service and interest costs by improving the correlation between projected cash flows and the corresponding spot yield curve rates. The change did not affect the measurement of the Companys pension and other postretirement benefit obligations for those plans and was accounted for as a change in accounting estimate, which was applied prospectively. Defined Benefit Pension Plans (non-U.S. plans) The principal defined benefit pension plan is the Boots Pension Plan covering certain employees in the United Kingdom (the Boots Plan). The Boots Plan is a funded final salary defined benefit plan providing pensions and death benefits to members. The Boots Plan was closed to future accrual effective July 1, 2010 with pensions calculated based on salaries up until that date. The Boots Plan is governed by a trustee board, which is independent of the Company. The plan is subject to a full funding actuarial valuation on a triennial basis. Defined benefit pension plan assets were invested in the following classes of securities as of August 31 : ##TABLE_START Percentage of fair market value   Equity securities  10.6%  8.9% Debt securities  83.3%  78.8% Real estate  5.3%  4.3% Other  0.8%  8.0% ##TABLE_ENDThe investment strategy of the principal defined benefit pension plan is to hold approximately 85% of its assets in a diverse portfolio of high quality bonds with the remainder invested in equity and real estate assets backing longer term liabilities. Interest rate and inflation rate swaps are also employed to complement the role of fixed and index-linked bond holdings in liability risk management. The following table presents defined benefit pension plan assets using the fair value hierarchy as of August 31, 2017 (in millions). ##TABLE_START   August 31, 2017  Level 1  Level 2  Level 3 Equity securities :         Equity securities 1  $  $   $  $           Debt securities:         Fixed interest government bonds 2       Index linked government bonds 2  3,354    3,354   Corporate bonds 3  3,251    3,251            Real estate:         Real estate 4                Other :         Other investments 5              Total  $ 8,980  $  $ 8,361  $ ##TABLE_END- 92 - ##TABLE_START   August 31, 2016  Level 1  Level 2  Level 3 Equity securities :         Equity securities 1  $  $   $  $           Debt securities:         Fixed interest government bonds 2       Index linked government bonds 2  3,502    3,502   Corporate bonds 3  3,663    3,663            Real estate:         Real estate 4                Other :         Other investments 5              Total  $ 9,428  $  $ 8,977  $ ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START 1  Equity securities, which mainly comprise investments in commingled funds, are valued based on quoted prices and are primarily exchange-traded. Securities for which official close or last trade pricing on an active exchange is available are classified as Level 1 investments. If closing prices are not available, securities are valued at the last quoted bid price and typically are categorized as Level 2 investments. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START 2  Debt securities: government bonds comprise fixed interest and index linked bonds issued by central governments, and are valued based on quotes received from independent pricing services or from dealers who make markets in such securities. Pricing services utilize pricing which considers readily available inputs such as the yield or price of bonds of comparable quality, coupon, maturity, and type, as well as dealer-supplied prices. Government bonds are categorized as Level 2 investments. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START 3  Debt securities: corporate bonds comprise bonds issued by corporations and are valued using recently executed transactions, or quoted market prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets, or for identical assets and liabilities in markets that are not active. If there have been no market transactions in a particular fixed income security, its fair value is calculated by pricing models that benchmark the security against other securities with actual market prices. Corporate bonds are categorized as Level 2 investments. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START 4  Real estate comprises investments in certain property funds which are valued based on the value of the underlying properties. These properties are valued using a number of standard industry techniques such as cost, discounted cash flows, independent appraisals and market based comparable data.

Defined contribution plans The principal retirement plan for U.S. employees is the Walgreen Profit-Sharing Retirement Trust, to which both the Company and participating employees contribute. The Companys contribution is in the form of a guaranteed match which is approved annually by the Walgreen Co. Board of Directors and reviewed by the Compensation Committee and Finance Committee of the Walgreens Boots Alliance Board of Directors. The profit-sharing provision was an expense of $221 million , $226 million and $158 million in fiscal 2017 , 2016 and 2015 , respectively. The Companys contributions were $220 million , $225 million and $249 million in fiscal 2017 , 2016 and 2015 , respectively. The Company also has certain contract based defined contribution arrangements. The principal one is the Alliance Healthcare  Boots Retirement Savings Plan, which is United Kingdom based and to which both the Company and participating employees contribute. The cost related to these arrangements recognized in the Consolidated Statement of Earnings was $112 million in fiscal 2017 , $130 million in fiscal 2016 and $93 million from the date of the Second Step Transaction through August 31, 2015.  Postretirement healthcare plan The Company provides certain health insurance benefits to retired U.S. employees who meet eligibility requirements, including age, years of service and date of hire. The costs of these benefits are accrued over the service life of the employee. An amendment to this plan in the third quarter of fiscal 2017 resulted in $109 million curtailment gain. The Companys postretirement health benefit plan obligation was $361 million and $466 million in fiscal 2017 and 2016 respectively and is not funded. The expected benefit to be paid net of the estimated federal subsidy during fiscal year 2018 is $10 million . 15. Capital stock In connection with the Companys capital policy, the Board of Directors has authorized share repurchase programs. In April 2017, Walgreens Boots Alliance authorized a stock repurchase program, which authorized the repurchase of up to $1.0 billion of Walgreens Boots Alliance common stock prior to the programs expiration on December 31, 2017. In May 2017, the Company completed this $1.0 billion stock repurchase program. In June 2017, Walgreens Boots Alliance authorized a new stock repurchase program, which authorizes the repurchase of up to $5.0 billion of Walgreens Boots Alliance common stock prior to the programs expiration on August 31, 2018. The Company purchased 59.0 million and 1.3 million shares under stock repurchase programs in fiscal 2017 and 2016 at a cost of $4.8 billion and $110 million , respectively. - 95 - The Company determines the timing and amount of repurchases based on its assessment of various factors including prevailing market conditions, alternate uses of capital, liquidity, the economic environment and other factors. The timing and amount of these purchases may change at any time and from time to time. The Company has repurchased, and may from time to time in the future repurchase, shares on the open market through Rule 10b5-1 plans, which enable a company to repurchase shares at times when it otherwise might be precluded from doing so under insider trading laws. In addition, the Company continued to repurchase shares to support the needs of the employee stock plans. Shares totaling $457 million were purchased to support the needs of the employee stock plans during fiscal 2017 as compared to $1.0 billion and $500 million in fiscal 2016 and fiscal 2015 , respectively. At August 31, 2017 , 39 million shares of common stock were reserved for future issuances under the Companys various employee benefit plans. 16.

See note 14, retirement benefits. ##TABLE_END 17. Segment reporting The Company has aligned its operations into three reportable segments: Retail Pharmacy USA, Retail Pharmacy International and Pharmaceutical Wholesale. The operating segments have been identified based on the financial data utilized by the Companys Chief Executive Officer (the chief operating decision maker) to assess segment performance and allocate resources among the Companys operating segments, which have been aggregated as described below. The chief operating decision maker uses adjusted operating income to assess segment profitability. The chief operating decision maker does not use total assets by segment to make decisions regarding resources, therefore the total asset disclosure by segment has not been included. - 96 - ##TABLE_START  The Retail Pharmacy USA segment consists of the legacy Walgreens business, which includes the operation of retail drugstores and convenient care clinics and the provision of specialty pharmacy services. Sales for the segment are principally derived from the sale of prescription drugs and a wide assortment of general merchandise, including non-prescription drugs, beauty products, photo finishing, seasonal merchandise, greeting cards and convenience foods. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  The Retail Pharmacy International segment consists primarily of the legacy Alliance Boots pharmacy-led health and beauty stores and optical practices. Stores are located in the United Kingdom, Mexico, Chile, Thailand, Norway, the Republic of Ireland, the Netherlands and Lithuania. Sales for the segment are principally derived from the sale of prescription drugs and retail health, beauty, toiletries and other consumer products. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  The Pharmaceutical Wholesale segment consists of the legacy Alliance Boots pharmaceutical wholesaling and distribution businesses and an equity method investment in AmerisourceBergen reported on a two-month lag. Wholesale operations are located in France, the United Kingdom, Germany, Turkey, Spain, The Netherlands, Egypt, Norway, Romania, Czech Republic and Lithuania. Sales for the segment are principally derived from wholesaling and distribution of a comprehensive offering of brand-name pharmaceuticals (including specialty pharmaceutical products) and generic pharmaceuticals, health and beauty products, home healthcare supplies and equipment, and related services to pharmacies and other healthcare providers. ##TABLE_END The results of operations for each reportable segment include procurement benefits, including WBAD operations and an allocation of corporate-related overhead costs. The Eliminations column contains items not allocable to the reportable segments, as the information is not utilized by the chief operating decision maker to assess segment performance and allocate resources. The segment information reflects the operating results of the Companys business segments. The Company began recording revenue and expense transactions using the new segments effective January 1, 2015. Beginning January 1, 2015, procurement benefits including WBAD operations have been allocated to the Retail Pharmacy USA, Retail Pharmacy International and Pharmaceutical Wholesale segments on a source of procurement benefit basis. Under this method, the procurement benefits are allocated to the segment whose purchase gave rise to the benefit. A procurement benefit arising on the purchase of an item for use in an entity in the Retail Pharmacy USA segment is recognized in the Retail Pharmacy USA segment and similarly for the Retail Pharmacy International and Pharmaceutical Wholesale segments. Procurement service income related to third parties is recognized in the Pharmaceutical Wholesale segment. The Companys Retail Pharmacy International and Pharmaceutical Wholesale segments were acquired as part of the Second Step Transaction in which the Company acquired the 55% of Alliance Boots that it did not already own on December 31, 2014. The Company has determined that it is impracticable to restate segment information for periods prior the completion of the Second Step Transaction, as well as to provide disclosures for such periods under both the old basis and new basis of reporting for certain items. Specifically, WBAD operations prior to December 31, 2014 were recorded in the Retail Pharmacy USA segment and have not been restated, as the Company believes it is impracticable to separate the information to the individual reportable segments. Equity earnings from Alliance Boots prior to the completion of the Second Step Transaction have been recorded within the Retail Pharmacy USA segment. The equity earnings of the 45% interest in Alliance Boots have not been separated into the Retail Pharmacy International and Pharmaceutical Wholesale segments for the prior period, as the Company believes it is impracticable. Accordingly, only eight months of results (January to August 2015) have been reported for these segments for fiscal 2015. - 97 - The following table reflects results of operations of the Companys reportable segments (in millions): ##TABLE_START  Retail Pharmacy USA  Retail Pharmacy International  Pharmaceutical Wholesale  Eliminations  Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc.

Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the framework in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). As permitted by the SEC, our assessment of internal controls over financial reporting excludes internal control over financial reporting of equity method investees. However, our assessment of internal control over financial reporting with respect to equity method investees did include controls over the recording of amounts related to our investment that are recorded in the Consolidated Financial Statements, including controls over the selection of accounting methods for our investments, the recognition of equity method earnings and losses and the determination, valuation and recording of our investment account balances. Based on our evaluation, management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of August 31, 2017 . Deloitte  Touche LLP, the Companys independent registered public accounting firm, has audited our internal control over financial reporting, as stated in its report which is included herein.  ##TABLE_START /s/ Stefano Pessina  /s/ George R.

We have audited the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets of Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. and subsidiaries (the Company) as of August 31, 2017 and 2016 , and the related Consolidated Statements of Earnings, Comprehensive Income, Equity, and Cash Flows for each of the three years in the period ended August 31, 2017 . These financial statements are the responsibility of the Companys management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. In our opinion, based on our audits, such Consolidated Financial Statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. and subsidiaries as of August 31, 2017 and 2016 , and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended August 31, 2017 , in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the Companys internal control over financial reporting as of August 31, 2017 , based on the criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated October 25, 2017 expressed an unqualified opinion on the Companys internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. /s/ DELOITTE  TOUCHE LLP Chicago, Illinois October 25, 2017  - 103 - REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM  To the Board of Directors and Shareholders Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc.  We have audited the internal control over financial reporting of Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. and subsidiaries (the Company) as of August 31, 2017 based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. The Companys management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Managements Report on Internal Control. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Companys internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. A companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the companys principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, and effected by the companys board of directors, management, and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting, including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Also, projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of August 31, 2017 , based on the criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the Consolidated Financial Statements as of and for the year ended August 31, 2017 of the Company and our report dated October 25, 2017 expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements. /s/ DELOITTE  TOUCHE LLP Chicago, Illinois October 25, 2017 - 104 - ", "9A": " Item 9A.

Report on internal control over financial reporting Managements report on internal control over financial reporting and the report of Deloitte  Touche LLP, the Companys independent registered public accounting firm, related to their assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting are included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K and are incorporated in this Item 9A by reference. Changes in internal control over financial reporting In connection with the evaluation pursuant to Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(d) of the Companys internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f)) by the Companys management, including its CEO and CFO, no changes during the quarter ended August 31, 2017 were identified that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Companys internal control over financial reporting. Inherent limitations on effectiveness of controls Our management, including the CEO and CFO, do not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent or detect all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the control systems objectives will be met. The design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Further, because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that misstatements due to error or fraud will not occur or that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the Company have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake. Controls can also be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people, or by management override of the controls. The design of any system of controls is based in part on certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. Projections of any evaluation of controls effectiveness to future periods are subject to risks. Over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or deterioration in the degree of compliance with policies or procedures. ", "9B": " Item 9B. Other information Store Optimization Program On October 24, 2017, the Companys Board of Directors approved a plan to implement a program (the Store Optimization Program) as part of an initiative to optimize store locations within the Companys Retail Pharmacy USA division upon completion of the acquisition of certain stores and related assets from Rite Aid. The Store Optimization Program includes plans to close approximately 600 stores across the U.S. and is expected to result in cost savings of $300 million per year to be delivered by the end of fiscal 2020. The actions under the Store Optimization Program are expected to take place over an 18 month period beginning in spring 2018. The Company currently estimates that it will recognize cumulative pre-tax charges to its GAAP financial results of approximately $450 million, including costs associated with lease obligations and other real estate costs, employee severance and other exit costs. The Company expects to incur pre-tax charges of approximately $270 million for lease obligations and other real estate costs and approximately $180 million for employee severance and other exit costs. The Company estimates that substantially all of these cumulative pre-tax charges will result in future cash expenditures. As the Store Optimization Program is implemented, charges will be recognized as the costs are incurred over time in accordance with GAAP. The Company intends to treat charges related to the Store Optimization Program as special items impacting comparability of results in its quarterly earnings disclosures. - 105 - The amounts and timing of all estimates are subject to change until finalized. The actual amounts and timing may vary materially based on various factors. See cautionary note regarding forward-looking statements above.

(GuoDa), a leading retail pharmacy chain in China. Following a public tender process, the Companys bid met all the requirements set by the seller to acquire a 40 percent equity interest in GuoDa for approximately $416 million . On July 5, 2018, the Company acquired its 40 percent equity interest and began to account for this investment using the equity method of accounting. See note 5 , equity method investments , to the Consolidated Financial Statements included herein for further information. On September 19, 2017, the Company announced that it had secured regulatory clearance for an amended and restated asset purchase agreement to purchase 1,932 stores, three distribution centers and related inventory from Rite Aid Corporation (Rite Aid) for $4.375 billion in cash and other consideration. The purchases of these stores occurred in waves during fiscal 2018 for total cash consideration of $4.2 billion and have been accounted for as business combinations. The transition of the first distribution center and related inventory occurred in September 2018 and the transition of the remaining two distribution centers and related inventory remains subject to closing conditions set forth in the amended and restated asset purchase agreement. Previously, on June 28, 2017, Walgreens Boots Alliance and Rite Aid had terminated an amended agreement and plan of merger pursuant to which the Company had agreed to acquire Rite Aid. Pursuant to such termination, the Company paid Rite Aid a termination fee of $325 million. The Company also reimbursed $25 million of transaction costs of Freds, Inc. in connection with the termination of an asset purchase agreement among the Company, Rite Aid and Freds, Inc. that was subject to the completion of the acquisition of Rite Aid by Walgreens Boots Alliance. See note 7 , debt , to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information relating to the termination of the amended agreement and plan of merger and related matters. On March 31, 2017, Walgreens Boots Alliance and pharmacy benefit manager Prime Therapeutics LLC closed a transaction to form a combined central specialty pharmacy and mail services company, AllianceRx Walgreens Prime, as part of a strategic alliance. AllianceRx Walgreens Prime is consolidated by Walgreens Boots Alliance and reported within the Retail Pharmacy USA division in its financial statements. See note 2 , acquisitions , to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information. In 2016, the Company exercised warrants to purchase an aggregate of 45,393,824 shares of AmerisourceBergen Corporation (AmerisourceBergen) common stock for an aggregate exercise price payment of $2.36 billion. Following the August 25, 2016 warrant exercise, the Company does not hold any further warrants to purchase shares of AmerisourceBergen common stock. As of August 31, 2018 and 2017 , the Company owned 56,854,867 AmerisourceBergen common shares, representing approximately 26% of the outstanding AmerisourceBergen common stock, which investment the Company accounts for using the equity method of accounting, subject to a two-month reporting lag and had designated one member of AmerisourceBergens board of directors. As of August 31, 2018 , the Company can acquire up to an additional 8,398,752 AmerisourceBergen shares in the open market and thereafter designate a second member of AmerisourceBergens board of directors, subject in each case to applicable legal and contractual requirements. The amount of permitted open market purchases is subject to increase or decrease in certain circumstances. The warrants were issued in March 2013 pursuant to a Framework Agreement between Walgreens, Alliance Boots GmbH (Alliance Boots) and AmerisourceBergen. Concurrently, Walgreens, Alliance Boots and AmerisourceBergen announced various other agreements and arrangements, including a ten-year pharmaceutical distribution agreement between Walgreens and AmerisourceBergen pursuant to which the Company sources branded and generic pharmaceutical products from AmerisourceBergen in the U.S. and an agreement which provides AmerisourceBergen the ability to access generics pharmaceutical products through the Companys global sourcing enterprise. In May 2016, certain agreements were extended for three years to now expire in 2026.  In addition, the Company has completed a number of additional acquisitions, divestitures and strategic initiatives in recent years designed to grow its businesses and enhance its competitive position. Please refer to managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in part II, item 7, below and note 2 , acquisitions , note 3 , exit and disposal activities , and note 5 , equity method investments , to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in part II, item 8, below for additional information. Industry overview The retail pharmacy and pharmaceutical wholesale industries across the globe are highly competitive and dynamic and have experienced consolidation and an evolving competitive landscape in recent years. Prescription drugs play a significant role in healthcare and constitute a first line of treatment for many medical conditions. The Company believes the long-term outlook for prescription drug utilization is strong due, in part, to aging populations, increases in life expectancy, increases in the availability of generic drugs, the continued development of innovative drugs that improve quality of life and control healthcare costs and increases in the number of persons with insurance coverage for prescription drugs, including, in the United States, baby boomers increasingly becoming eligible for the federally funded Medicare Part D prescription program. Pharmaceutical - 2 - wholesalers act as a vital link between drug manufacturers and pharmacies and healthcare providers in supplying pharmaceuticals to patients. The retail pharmacy industry across the globe relies significantly on private and governmental third-party payers. Many private organizations throughout the healthcare industry, including pharmacy benefit management (PBM) companies and health insurance companies, have consolidated in recent years to create larger healthcare enterprises with greater bargaining power. Third-party payers, including the Medicare Part D plans and the state-sponsored Medicaid and related managed care Medicaid agencies in the United States, can change eligibility requirements or reduce certain reimbursement rates. In addition, in many European countries, the government provides or subsidizes healthcare to consumers and regulates pharmaceutical prices, patient eligibility and reimbursement levels to control costs for the government-sponsored healthcare system. Changes in law or regulation also can impact reimbursement rates and terms. For example, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (the ACA) was enacted to help control federal healthcare spending, including for prescription drugs, in the United States. These changes generally are expected to reduce Medicaid reimbursements in the United States. State Medicaid programs are also expected to continue to seek reductions in reimbursements. When third-party payers or governmental authorities take actions that restrict eligibility or reduce prices or reimbursement rates, sales and margins in the retail pharmacy industry could be reduced, which would adversely affect industry profitability. In some cases, these possible adverse effects may be partially or entirely offset by controlling inventory costs and other expenses, dispensing more higher margin generics, finding new revenue streams through pharmacy services or other offerings and/or dispensing a greater volume of prescriptions. These industry dynamics and challenges are continuous and have intensified in recent years. Since the completion of the strategic combination with Alliance Boots in December 2014, the Company has had a continuous focus on operational efficiencies and cost reduction. During fiscal 2019, the Company intends to maintain this focus, including the evaluation of a number of potential strategic cost management initiatives. Generic prescription drugs have continued to help lower overall costs for customers and third-party payers. The Company expects the utilization of generic pharmaceuticals to continue to increase. In general, in the United States, generic versions of drugs generate lower sales dollars per prescription, but higher gross profit dollars, as compared with patent-protected brand name drugs. The impact on retail pharmacy gross profit dollars can be significant in the first several months after a generic version of a drug is first allowed to compete with the branded version, which is generally referred to as a generic conversion. In any given year, the number of major brand name drugs that undergo a conversion from branded to generic status can vary and the timing of generic conversions can be difficult to predict, which can have a significant impact on retail pharmacy sales and gross profit dollars. The Company expects that market demand, government regulation, third-party reimbursement policies, government contracting requirements and other pressures will continue to cause the industries in which the Company competes to evolve. Pharmacists are on the frontlines of the healthcare delivery system, and the Company believes rising healthcare costs and the limited supply of primary care physicians present opportunities for pharmacists and retail pharmacies to play an even greater role in driving positive outcomes for patients and payers through expanded service offerings such as immunizations and other preventive care, healthcare clinics, pharmacist-led medication therapy management and chronic condition management. Segments Our operations are organized into three divisions, which are also our reportable segments:  ##TABLE_START  Retail Pharmacy USA; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Retail Pharmacy International; and ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Pharmaceutical Wholesale. ##TABLE_END For fiscal 2018 , our segment sales were: Retail Pharmacy USA, $98.4 billion ; Retail Pharmacy International, $12.3 billion ; and Pharmaceutical Wholesale, $23.0 billion . Additional information relating to our segments is included in managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in part II, item 7 below and in note 16 , segment reporting , to our Consolidated Financial Statements included in part II, item 8 below, which information is incorporated herein by reference. Retail Pharmacy USA The Retail Pharmacy USA division (excluding equity method investments) has pharmacy-led health and beauty retail offerings in 50 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands, each focused on helping people feel happy and healthy. The Company operated 9,560 retail stores in the division as of August 31, 2018 . The principal retail pharmacy brands in the division are Walgreens and Duane Reade. The Company is a market leader in the United States and, as of August 31, - 3 - 2018 , approximately 78% of the population of the United States lived within five miles of a Walgreens, Duane Reade or acquired Rite Aid retail pharmacy. The division provides customers with convenient, omni-channel access to consumer goods and services, including own branded general merchandise such as NICE!, DeLish  , Soap  Glory, No7 and Well at Walgreens, as well as pharmacy and health and wellness services in communities across America. Integrated with the Companys e-commerce platform, the Walgreens mobile application allows customers to refill prescriptions through scan technology, receive alerts when a refill is due and perform retail functionality, such as ordering photo prints, shopping for products and clipping coupons. The Companys services help improve health outcomes for patients and manage costs for payers including employers, managed care organizations, health systems, PBM companies and the public sector. The Company utilizes its retail network as a channel to provide health and wellness services to its customers and patients, as illustrated by the Companys ability to play a significant role in providing flu vaccines and other immunizations. The Company also provides specialty pharmacy and mail services. As of August 31, 2018 , the Company had approximately 400 in-store clinic locations throughout the United States, some of which are operated by the Company and some of which are operated by health system partners. The Company has more than 85,000 healthcare service providers, including pharmacists, pharmacy technicians, nurse practitioners and other health related professionals. The components of the divisions sales are Pharmacy (the sale of prescription drugs and provision of pharmacy-related services) and Retail (the sale of healthcare and retail products including non-prescription drugs, beauty, toiletries and general merchandise). The divisions sales are subject to the influence of seasonality, particularly the winter holiday and cough, cold and flu seasons. This seasonality also can affect the divisions proportion of sales between Retail and Pharmacy during certain periods. The components of the divisions fiscal year sales were as follows: ##TABLE_START   Fiscal 2018  Fiscal 2017  Fiscal 2016 Pharmacy  %  %  % Retail  %  %  % Total  %  %  % ##TABLE_ENDThe Company filled 823.1 million prescriptions (including immunizations) in the division in fiscal 2018 . Adjusted to 30-day equivalents, prescriptions filled were 1.1 billion in fiscal 2018 . Sales where reimbursement is received from managed care organizations, governmental agencies, PBM companies and private insurance were approximately 98% of the divisions fiscal 2018 Pharmacy sales. The Company fills prescriptions for many state Medicaid public assistance programs. Sales from all such Medicaid plans were approximately 4% of the divisions fiscal 2018 sales. Sales from Medicare Part D plans were approximately 19% of the divisions fiscal 2018 sales. The Companys U.S. loyalty program, Balance Rewards, is designed to reward its most valuable customers and encourage shopping in stores and online. Balance Rewards members receive special pricing on select products and earn everyday rewards points for purchasing most merchandise that can be instantly redeemed in store or through walgreens.com. As of August 31, 2018 , the number of active Balance Rewards members totaled approximately 88 million . For this purpose, an active member is defined here as someone who has used their card in the last six months. AmerisourceBergen supplies and distributes a significant amount of generic and branded pharmaceutical products to the divisions pharmacies. The Company purchases its non-pharmaceutical merchandise from numerous manufacturers and wholesalers. The divisions sales, gross profit margin and gross profit are impacted by, among other things, both the percentage of prescriptions filled that are generic and the rate at which new generic drugs are introduced to the market. Because any number of factors outside of the Companys control can affect timing for a generic conversion, the Company faces substantial uncertainty in predicting when such conversions will occur and what effect they will have on particular future periods. The current environment of the Companys pharmacy business also includes ongoing reimbursement pressure and a shift in pharmacy mix towards 90-day at retail (one prescription that is the equivalent of three 30-day prescriptions) and Medicare Part D prescriptions. Further consolidation among generic manufacturers coupled with changes in the number of major brand name drugs anticipated to undergo a conversion from branded to generic status may also result in gross margin pressures within the industry. - 4 - The Company continuously faces reimbursement pressure from PBM companies, health maintenance organizations, managed care organizations and other commercial third-party payers; agreements with these payers are regularly subject to expiration, termination or renegotiation. In addition, plan changes with rate adjustments often occur in January and the Companys reimbursement arrangements may provide for rate adjustments at prescribed intervals during their term. The Company experienced lower reimbursement rates in fiscal 2018 as compared to the same period in the prior year. The Company expects these pressures to continue. The Company has also worked to develop and expand its relationships with commercial third-party payers to enable new and/or improved market access via participation in pharmacy provider networks they offer. The prescription volume impact of new agreements and relationships typically is incremental over time. The Companys 90-day at retail prescription drug offering is typically at a lower margin than comparable 30-day prescriptions, but provides the Company with the opportunity to increase business with patients with chronic prescription needs while offering increased convenience, helping facilitate improved prescription adherence and resulting in a lower cost to fill the 90-day prescription. Retail Pharmacy International The Retail Pharmacy International division (excluding equity method investments) has pharmacy-led health and beauty retail businesses in eight countries, each focused on helping people look and feel their best. The Company operated 4,767 retail stores in the division as of August 31, 2018 (see properties in part I, item 2 below for information regarding geographic coverage) and has grown its online presence significantly in recent years. The Companys principal retail pharmacy brands are Boots in the United Kingdom, Thailand, Norway, the Republic of Ireland and The Netherlands, Benavides in Mexico and Ahumada in Chile. In Europe, the Company is a market leader and its retail stores are conveniently located and its pharmacists are well placed to provide a significant role in the provision of healthcare services, working closely with other primary healthcare providers in the communities the Company serves. The Boots omni-channel offering is differentiated from that of competitors due to the product brands the Company owns, such as No7, Boots Pharmaceuticals, Soap  Glory, Liz Earle, Sleek MakeUp, Botanics and only at Boots exclusive products, together with its long established reputation for trust and customer care. The Companys brands portfolio is enhanced by its in-house product research and development capabilities. The Companys retail store networks are typically complemented by online platforms. In the United Kingdom, through the boots.com website and integrated mobile application, the order and collect service allows customers to order from a range of over 33,000 products by 8:00 p.m. and collect from noon the following day from approximately 99% of the United Kingdoms retail stores as of August 31, 2018 . The Boots Advantage Card loyalty program, where customers earn points on purchases for redemption at a later date, continues to be a key element of the Boots offering. As of August 31, 2018 , the number of active Boots Advantage Card members totaled approximately 15 million . For this purpose, an active member is defined as someone who has used their card in the last six months. In addition, Boots in the United Kingdom is one of the leaders in the optical market with 618 practices, of which 167 operated on a franchise basis as of August 31, 2018 . Approximately 30% of these optical practices are located in Boots stores with the balance being standalone optical practices. The components of the divisions sales are Pharmacy (typically the sale of prescription drugs and provision of pharmacy-related services, subject to variation in particular jurisdictions depending upon regulatory and other factors) and Retail (primarily the sale of health and beauty products including beauty, toiletries and lifestyle merchandising, non-prescription drugs and, in the United Kingdom, the provision of optical services). - 5 - The divisions sales are subject to the influence of seasonality, with the second fiscal quarter typically the strongest as a result of the winter holiday period. This seasonality affects the divisions proportion of sales between Retail and Pharmacy during certain periods. The components of the divisions fiscal year sales were as follows: ##TABLE_START   Fiscal 2018  Fiscal 2017  Fiscal 2016 Pharmacy  %  %  % Retail  %  %  % Total  %  %  % ##TABLE_ENDThe divisions Retail sales, gross profit margin and gross profit dollars are impacted by, among other things, the highly competitive nature of the health and beauty category, specifically the Company and its competitors pricing actions, promotional offers and events and the customers desire for value and convenience. The divisions Pharmacy sales, gross margin and gross profit dollars are impacted by governmental agencies and other third-party payers seeking to minimize increases in the costs of healthcare, including pharmaceutical drug reimbursement rates. In the United Kingdom, which is the divisions largest market for Pharmacy sales, the amount of government funding available for pharmacy services is typically reviewed and agreed with the pharmacy industry on an annual basis. In addition, performance as measured in U.S. dollars is impacted by the exchange rates used to translate these amounts into U.S. dollars, the exchange rate of British pound sterling being the most significant. Pharmaceutical Wholesale The Pharmaceutical Wholesale division (excluding equity method investments), which mainly operates under the Alliance Healthcare brand, supplies medicines, other healthcare products and related services to more than 110,000 pharmacies, doctors, health centers and hospitals each year from 291 distribution centers in 11 countries, primarily in Europe, as of August 31,  2018 . The distribution of prescription medicines to pharmacists comprises the vast majority of the divisions sales. The wholesale businesses seek to provide high core service levels to pharmacists in terms of frequency of delivery, product availability, delivery accuracy, timeliness and reliability at competitive prices. The Company also offers customers innovative added-value services to help pharmacists develop their own businesses. This includes membership of Alphega Pharmacy, the Companys pan-European network for independent pharmacies, which, as of August 31, 2018 , had over 6,600 members. In addition to the wholesale of medicines and other healthcare products, the divisions businesses provide services to pharmaceutical manufacturers which are increasingly seeking to gain greater control over their product distribution, while at the same time outsourcing non-core activities. These services include pre-wholesale and contract logistics (mainly under the Alloga brand), direct deliveries to pharmacies and innovative and specialized healthcare services, covering clinical homecare, medicine support, dispensing services, medicine preparation and clinical trial support (mainly under the Alcura brand). Combined with local engagement, scale is important in pharmaceutical wholesaling. Walgreens Boots Alliance is one of the largest pharmaceutical wholesalers and distributors in Europe, and it ranks as one of the top three in market share in many of the individual countries in which it operates. The divisions sales, gross profit margin and gross profit dollars are impacted by, among other things, government actions, which typically seek to reduce the growth in prescription drug consumption, reduce reimbursement rates and increase generic drug utilization. A greater proportion of generic drugs, whether as a result of government actions, generic conversions or other factors, typically has an adverse effect on the Companys revenues. However, in the wholesale division, the Company typically earns equal or better gross margins on generic drugs than on branded drugs, although there are exceptions. Changes in manufacturers product distribution business models can also impact the divisions sales and gross margin. For example, when pharmaceutical drug manufacturers introduce fee-for-service contracts, the Companys sales are reduced even if it is successful in winning these contracts, as the Company only recognizes sales for the amount of the fees charged. Other manufacturer services, including pre-wholesale and contract logistics operations, are typically on a fee-for-service basis. In addition, performance as measured in U.S. dollars is impacted by the exchange rates used to translate these amounts into U.S. dollars, the exchange rate of British pound sterling and the Euro being the most significant. The divisions sales are subject to less seasonality than the Companys other divisions. Intellectual property and licenses - 6 - The Company markets products and services under various trademarks, trade dress and trade names and relies on a combination of patent, copyright, trademark, service mark and trade secret laws, as well as contractual restrictions to establish and protect its proprietary rights. The Company owns numerous domain names, holds numerous patents, has registered numerous trademarks and has filed applications for the registration of a number of other trademarks and service marks in various jurisdictions. The Company holds assorted business licenses (such as pharmacy, occupational, liquor and cigarette) having various lives within multiple legal jurisdictions, which are necessary for the normal operation of the business. Seasonal variations in business The Walgreens Boots Alliance business is affected by a number of factors including, among others, its sales performance during holiday periods (including particularly the winter holiday season) and during the cough, cold and flu season (the timing and severity of which is difficult to predict), significant weather conditions, the timing of its own or competitor discount programs and pricing actions and the timing of changes in levels of reimbursement from governmental agencies and other third-party payers. See the summary of quarterly results (unaudited) in note 18 , supplementary financial information , to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in part II, item 8 below. Sources and availability of raw materials Inventories are purchased from numerous domestic and foreign suppliers. The Company does not believe that the loss of any one supplier or group of suppliers under common control would have a material adverse effect on its business or that of any of its divisions. Working capital practices Effective inventory management is important to the Companys operations. The Company uses various inventory management techniques, including demand forecasting and planning and various forms of replenishment management. Its working capital needs typically are greater in the months leading up to the winter holiday season. The Company generally finances its inventory and expansion needs with internally-generated funds and short-term debt. For additional information, see the liquidity and capital resources section in managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in part II, item 7, below. Customers The Company sells to numerous retail and wholesale customers. No single customer accounted for more than 10% of the Companys consolidated sales for any of the periods presented. In fiscal 2018, substantially all of our retail pharmacy sales were to customers covered by third-party payers (e.g., pharmacy benefit managers, insurance companies and governmental agencies) that agree to pay for all or a portion of a customer's eligible prescription purchases. Three third-party payers, in the Retail Pharmacy USA division, in the aggregate accounted for approximately 32% of the Companys consolidated sales in fiscal 2018 . See note 16 , segment reporting , to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Regulation In the countries in which the Company does business, the Company is subject to national, state and local laws, regulations and administrative practices concerning retail and wholesale pharmacy operations, including regulations relating to the Companys participation in Medicare, Medicaid and other publicly financed health benefit plans; regulations prohibiting kickbacks, beneficiary inducement and the submission of false claims; the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA); the ACA; licensure and registration requirements concerning the operation of pharmacies and the practice of pharmacy; and regulations of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, the U.S. Federal Trade Commission, the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration and the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission, as well as regulations promulgated by comparable foreign, state and local governmental authorities concerning the operation of the Companys businesses. The Company is also subject to laws and regulations relating to licensing, tax, foreign trade, intellectual property, privacy and data protection, currency, political and other business restrictions. The Company is also governed by national, state and local laws of general applicability in the countries in which it does business, including laws regulating matters of working conditions, health and safety and equal employment opportunity. In connection with the operation of its businesses, the Company is subject to laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment and health and safety matters, including those governing exposure to, and the management and disposal of, hazardous substances. Environmental protection requirements did not have a material effect on the results of operations or capital expenditures of the Company in fiscal 2018 . Competitive conditions - 7 - The industries in which the Company operates are highly competitive. As a leader in the retail pharmacy industry and as a retailer of general merchandise, the Company competes with various local, regional, national and global retailers, including chain and independent pharmacies, mail order prescription providers, grocery stores, convenience stores, mass merchants, online and omni-channel pharmacies and retailers, warehouse clubs, dollar stores and other discount merchandisers. The Companys pharmaceutical wholesale businesses compete with other pharmaceutical wholesalers as well as alternative supply sources such as importers and manufacturers who supply directly to pharmacies. The Company competes primarily on the basis of service, convenience, variety and price. Its geographic dispersion helps mitigate the impact of temporary, localized economic and competitive conditions in individual markets. See properties in part I, item 2, below for further information regarding the Companys geographic dispersion. Employees As of August 31, 2018 , the Company employed approximately 354,000 persons, approximately 110,000 of whom were part-time employees working less than 30 hours per week. The foregoing does not include employees of equity method investments.  Research and development While the global brands portfolio of the Company is enhanced by in-house product research and development capabilities, the amount spent by the Company on research and development activities is not material. Financial information about foreign and domestic operations and export sales Certain financial information relating to foreign and domestic operations, including total revenues and long-lived assets aggregated by our U.S. and non-U.S. operations, is included in note 16 , segment reporting , to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in part II, item 8 below, which information is incorporated herein by reference. See risk factors in part I, item 1A below for information regarding risks attendant to the Companys foreign operations.

Risk factors In addition to the other information in this report and our other filings with the SEC, you should carefully consider the risks described below, which could materially and adversely affect our business operations, financial condition and results of operations. These risks are not the only risks that we face. Our business operations could also be affected by additional factors that are not presently known to us or that we currently consider to be immaterial. Reductions in third-party reimbursement levels, from private or governmental agency plans, and potential changes in industry pricing benchmarks for prescription drugs could materially and adversely affect our results of operations. The substantial majority of the prescriptions we fill are reimbursed by third-party payers, including private and governmental agency payers. The continued efforts of health maintenance organizations, managed care organizations, PBM companies, governmental agencies, and other third-party payers to reduce prescription drug costs and pharmacy reimbursement rates, as well as litigation and other legal proceedings relating to how drugs are priced, may adversely impact our results of operations. In the United States, plan changes with rate adjustments often occur in January and our reimbursement arrangements may provide for rate adjustments at prescribed intervals during their term. In addition, in an environment where some PBM clients utilize narrow or restricted pharmacy provider networks, some of these entities may offer pricing terms that we may not be willing to accept or otherwise restrict our participation in their networks of pharmacy providers. Changes in political, economic and regulatory influences also may significantly affect healthcare financing and prescription drug reimbursement practices. In the United States, for example, there have been multiple attempts through executive action, legislative action and legal challenges to modify or repeal the ACA. We cannot predict whether current or future efforts to modify or repeal these laws will be successful, nor can we predict the impact that such a modification or repeal and any - 8 - subsequent legislation would have on our business and reimbursement levels. There have also been a number of other proposals and enactments by the federal government and various states to reduce Medicare Part D and Medicaid reimbursement levels in response to budget deficits, and we expect additional proposals in the future. In the event that a third-party payers budgetary or financial condition deteriorates, they may not be able to pay timely, or may delay payment of, amounts owed to us. There can be no assurance that recent or future changes in prescription drug reimbursement policies and practices will not materially and adversely affect our results of operations. In many countries where we have operations, the government provides or subsidizes healthcare to consumers and regulates pharmaceutical prices, patient eligibility and reimbursement levels to control costs for the government-sponsored healthcare system. Efforts to control healthcare costs, including prescription drug costs, are continuous and reductions in third-party reimbursement levels could materially and adversely affect our results of operations. In addition, many payers in the United States are increasingly considering new metrics as the basis for reimbursement rates. It is possible that the pharmaceutical industry or regulators may evaluate and/or develop an alternative pricing reference to replace average wholesale price, which is the pricing reference used for many of our contracts. In addition, many state Medicaid fee-for-service programs have established pharmacy network payments on the basis of actual acquisition cost, which could have an impact on reimbursement practices in other commercial and governmental arrangements. Future changes to the pricing benchmarks used to establish pharmaceutical pricing, including changes in the basis for calculating reimbursement by third-party payers, could adversely affect us. A shift in pharmacy mix toward lower margin plans and programs could adversely affect our results of operations. Our Retail Pharmacy USA division seeks to grow prescription volume while operating in a marketplace with continuous reimbursement pressure. A shift in the mix of pharmacy prescription volume towards programs offering lower reimbursement rates could adversely affect our results of operations. For example, our Retail Pharmacy USA division has experienced a shift in pharmacy mix towards 90-day at retail in recent years. Our 90-day at retail offering for patients with chronic prescription needs typically is at a lower margin than comparable 30-day prescriptions. Our Retail Pharmacy USA division also has experienced a shift in pharmacy mix towards Medicare Part D prescriptions in recent years, and that trend may continue. Preferred Medicare Part D networks have increased in number in recent years; however, we do not participate in all such networks. We have accepted lower reimbursement rates in order to secure preferred relationships with Medicare Part D plans serving senior patients with significant pharmacy needs. We also have worked to develop and expand our relationships with commercial third-party payers to enable new and/or improved market access via participation in the pharmacy provider networks they offer. If we are not able to generate additional prescription volume and other business from patients participating in these programs that is sufficient to offset the impact of lower reimbursement, or if the degree or terms of our participation in such preferred networks declines from current levels in future years, our results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. We derive a significant portion of our sales in the United States from prescription drug sales reimbursed by a limited number of pharmacy benefit management companies. We derive a significant portion of our sales in the United States from prescription drug sales reimbursed through prescription drug plans administered by a limited number of PBM companies. PBM companies typically administer multiple prescription drug plans that expire at various times and provide for varying reimbursement rates, and often limit coverage to specific drug products on an approved list, known as a formulary, which might not include all of the approved drugs for a particular indication. There can be no assurance that we will continue to participate in any particular PBM companys pharmacy provider network in any particular future time period. If our participation in the pharmacy provider network for a prescription drug plan administered by one or more of the large PBM companies is restricted or terminated, we expect that our sales would be adversely affected, at least in the short-term. If we are unable to replace any such lost sales, either through an increase in other sales or through a resumption of participation in those plans, our operating results could be materially and adversely affected. If we exit a pharmacy provider network and later resume participation, there can be no assurance that we will achieve any particular level of business on any particular pace, or that all clients of the PBM company will choose to include us again in the pharmacy network for their plans, initially or at all. In addition, in such circumstances we may incur increased marketing and other costs in connection with initiatives to regain former patients and attract new patients covered by such plans. We could be adversely affected by a decrease in the introduction of new brand name and generic prescription drugs as well as increases in the cost to procure prescription drugs. The profitability of our pharmacy businesses depends upon the utilization of prescription drugs. Utilization trends are affected by, among other factors, the introduction of new and successful prescription drugs as well as lower-priced generic alternatives to existing brand name drugs. Inflation in the price of drugs also can adversely affect utilization, particularly given the increased prevalence of high-deductible health insurance plans and related plan design changes. New brand name drugs can - 9 - result in increased drug utilization and associated sales, while the introduction of lower priced generic alternatives typically results in relatively lower sales, but relatively higher gross profit margins. Accordingly, a decrease in the number or magnitude of significant new brand name drugs or generics successfully introduced, delays in their introduction, or a decrease in the utilization of previously introduced prescription drugs, could materially and adversely affect our results of operations. In addition, if we experience an increase in the amounts we pay to procure pharmaceutical drugs, including generic drugs, it could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. Our gross profit margins would be adversely affected to the extent we are not able to offset such cost increases. Any failure to fully offset any such increased prices and costs or to modify our activities to mitigate the impact could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. Additionally, any future changes in drug prices could be significantly different than our expectations. Consolidation and strategic alliances in the healthcare industry could adversely affect our business operations, competitive positioning, financial condition and results of operations. Many organizations in the healthcare industry, including PBM companies, have consolidated in recent years to create larger healthcare enterprises with greater bargaining power, which has resulted in greater pricing pressures. If this consolidation trend continues, it could give the resulting enterprises even greater bargaining power, which may lead to further pressure on the prices for our products and services. If these pressures result in reductions in our prices, our businesses would become less profitable unless we are able to achieve corresponding reductions in costs or develop profitable new revenue streams. New and proposed acquisitions, partnerships and strategic alliances in the healthcare industry also can alter market dynamics and impact our businesses and competitive positioning. For example, in December 2017, CVS Health Corporation, an integrated pharmacy health care company that operates one of the largest retail drugstore chains and PBM companies in the United States, announced an agreement to acquire Aetna, Inc., one of the largest diversified health care benefits companies, subject to certain closing conditions. Changes in the participants in global sourcing enterprises relating to drug procurement, whether as a result of mergers, acquisitions or other transactions, can also have a similar effect on market dynamics and our business. In addition, further consolidation among generic drug manufacturers could lead to generic drug inflation in the future. We expect that market demand, government regulation, third-party reimbursement policies, government contracting requirements, and other pressures will continue to cause the healthcare industry to evolve, potentially resulting in further business consolidations and alliances and increased vertical integration among the industry participants we engage with, and which could, if we are not able to successfully anticipate and respond to evolving industry conditions in a timely and effective manner, materially and adversely impact our business operations, financial condition and results of operations. Our growth strategy is partially dependent upon our ability to identify and successfully complete acquisitions, joint ventures and other strategic alliances. A significant element of our growth strategy is to identify, pursue and successfully complete acquisitions, joint ventures and other strategic alliances that either expand or complement our existing operations. We have grown significantly through acquisitions in recent years and expect to continue to acquire, partner with or invest in businesses that build on or are deemed complementary to our existing businesses or further our strategic objectives. Due in part to consolidation in the industries in which we compete, there is significant competition for attractive targets and opportunities when available. There can be no assurance that attractive acquisition or other strategic relationship opportunities will be available, that we will be successful in identifying, negotiating and consummating favorable transaction opportunities, or that any such transactions we complete will be successful and justify our investment of financial and other resources therein. Acquisitions and other strategic transactions involve numerous risks, including difficulties in successfully integrating the operations and personnel, distraction of management from overseeing, and disruption of, our existing operations, difficulties in entering markets or lines of business in which we have no or limited direct prior experience, the possible loss of key employees and customers, and difficulties in achieving the synergies we anticipated. Any failure to select suitable opportunities at fair prices, conduct appropriate due diligence and successfully integrate the acquired company, including particularly when acquired businesses operate in new geographic markets or areas of business, could materially and adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations. These transactions may also cause us to significantly increase our interest expense, leverage and debt service requirements if we incur additional debt to pay for an acquisition or investment, issue common stock that would dilute our current stockholders percentage ownership, or incur asset write-offs and restructuring costs and other related expenses that could have a material adverse impact on our operating results. Acquisitions, joint ventures and strategic investments also involve numerous other risks, including potential exposure to assumed litigation and unknown environmental and other liabilities, as well as undetected internal control, regulatory or other issues, or additional costs not anticipated at the time the transaction was completed. No assurance can be given that our acquisitions, joint ventures and other strategic alliances will be successful and will not materially adversely affect our business operations, financial condition or - 10 - results of operations. If we are unable to successfully identify, complete and integrate acquisitions, joint ventures and strategic investments in a timely and effective manner, our business operations and growth strategies could be negatively affected. Our strategic relationships include outsourcing and similar relationships. We outsource certain business and administrative functions and rely on third parties to perform certain services on our behalf. For example, in 2017 we entered into a 10-year global agreement with Fareva for the manufacture and supply of own beauty brands and private label products. Under the terms of the agreement, Fareva acquired BCM, Walgreens Boots Alliances contract manufacturing business, in October 2017. We rely on these third parties to meet our quality and performance requirements and to timely perform as expected. We periodically negotiate provisions and renewals of these relationships, and there can be no assurance that such terms will remain acceptable to us or such third parties. If our continuing relationship with certain third-party providers is interrupted, or if such third-party providers experience disruptions or do not perform as anticipated, or we experience problems with any transition, we may experience operational difficulties, reputational harm, and increased costs that could materially and adversely affect our business operations and results of operations. We may not realize the anticipated benefits of the acquisition of assets from Rite Aid pursuant to the Amended and Restated Asset Purchase Agreement, which could adversely impact our results of operations. We entered into the Amended and Restated Asset Purchase Agreement to acquire certain Rite Aid stores and distribution centers with the expectation that the transaction will result in various benefits, including, among other things, cost savings and operating efficiencies. The achievement of the anticipated benefits of the transaction is subject to a number of uncertainties, including completion of the pending acquisition of distribution centers and related inventory expected to begin during fiscal 2019, whether the acquired assets can be integrated into our business in an efficient and effective manner, the possibility of faulty assumptions underlying expectations regarding potential synergies and the integration process, unforeseen expenses or delays, and competitive factors in the marketplace. We can provide no assurance that the anticipated benefits of the transaction, including cost savings and synergies, will be fully realized in the time frame anticipated or at all; the costs or difficulties related to the integration of the acquired assets into our business and operations will not be greater than expected; unanticipated costs, charges and expenses will not result from the transaction; litigation relating to the transaction will not be filed; and the transaction will not cause disruption to the parties business and operations and relationships with employees and suppliers, payers, customers and other third parties. If one or more of these risks are realized, it could have a material adverse impact on our operating results. We could also encounter unforeseen transaction and integration-related costs or other circumstances, such as unforeseen liabilities or other issues resulting from the transaction. Many of these potential circumstances are outside of our control and any of them could result in increased costs, decreased revenue, decreased synergies and the diversion of management time and attention, which could adversely impact our agility to respond to market opportunities and our ability to timely identify and implement other strategic actions. If we are unable to achieve our objectives within the anticipated time frame, or at all, the expected benefits may not be realized fully or at all, or may take longer to realize than expected, which could have a material adverse impact on our business operations, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, we have incurred significant transaction costs related to the transaction and expect to continue to incur significant integration and related costs as we integrate the acquired Rite Aid assets. These integration and acquisition-related costs, including legal, accounting, financial and tax advisory and other fees and costs, may be higher than expected and some of these costs may be material. Our business results depend on our ability to successfully manage ongoing organizational change and business transformation and achieve cost savings and operating efficiency initiatives. Our Board of Directors approved the plan to implement the Store Optimization Program described in managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in part II, item 7 below as part of an initiative to reduce costs and increase operating efficiencies. There can be no assurance that we will realize, in full or in part, the anticipated benefits of this program. Our financial goals assume a level of productivity improvement, including those reflected in the Store Optimization Program and other business optimization initiatives. If we are unable to deliver these expected productivity improvements, while continuing to invest in business growth, or if the volume and nature of change overwhelms available resources, our business operations and financial results could be materially and adversely impacted. Our ability to successfully manage and execute these initiatives and realize expected savings and benefits in the amounts and at the times anticipated is important to our business success. Any failure to do so, which could result from our inability to successfully execute organizational change and business transformation plans, changes in global or regional economic conditions, competition, changes in the industries in which we compete, unanticipated costs or charges, loss of key personnel and other factors described herein, could have a material adverse effect on our businesses, financial condition and results of operations. - 11 - The industries in which we operate are highly competitive and constantly evolving. New entrants to the market, existing competitor actions or other changes in market dynamics could adversely impact us. The level of competition in the retail pharmacy and pharmaceutical wholesale industries is high. Changes in market dynamics or actions of competitors or manufacturers, including industry consolidation and the emergence of new competitors and strategic alliances, could materially and adversely impact us. Disruptive innovation, or the perception of potentially disruptive innovation, by existing or new competitors could alter the competitive landscape in the future and require us to accurately identify and assess such changes and if required make timely and effective changes to our strategies and business model to compete effectively. For example, in June 2018, online retailer Amazon.com, Inc. announced its pending acquisition of PillPack, an online pharmacy with licenses throughout the United States, subject to regulatory approvals and other customary closing conditions. Some industry analysts have speculated that the acquisition, if completed, could provide a platform for Amazon to significantly expand into the market for prescription drugs. Our retail pharmacy businesses face intense competition from local, regional, national and global companies, including other drugstore and pharmacy chains, independent drugstores and pharmacies, mail-order pharmacies and various other retailers such as grocery stores, convenience stores, mass merchants, online and omni-channel pharmacies and retailers, warehouse clubs, dollar stores and other discount merchandisers, some of which are aggressively expanding in markets we serve. Businesses in our Pharmaceutical Wholesale division face intense competition from direct competitors, including national and regional cooperative wholesalers, and alternative supply sources such as importers and manufacturers who supply directly to pharmacies. Competition may also come from other sources in the future. As competition increases in the markets in which we operate, a significant increase in general pricing pressures could occur, which could require us to reevaluate our pricing structures to remain competitive. For example, if we are not able to anticipate and successfully respond to changes in market conditions in our Pharmaceutical Wholesale division, including changes driven by competitors, suppliers or manufacturers and increased competition from national and regional cooperative wholesalers, it could result in a loss of customers or renewal of contracts or arrangements on less favorable terms. We also could be adversely affected if we fail to identify or effectively respond to changes in market dynamics. As technology, consumer behavior and market conditions continue to evolve in the United States, it is important that we maintain the relevance of our brand and product and service offerings to customers and patients. In April 2018, we announced that we are testing a number of concepts and initiatives designed to position our stores in the United States as convenient community hubs for healthcare and retail products and services. The concepts being tested include new approaches to pricing and promotions, product selection, in-store and digital experience, and strategic partnerships that bring new products and services to our customers. We plan to use these pilots to listen to customers, learn and adjust based on feedback, with decisions on the nature and extent of further roll-outs made over time as we gain experience. If our customers are not receptive to these changes, if we are unable to expand successful programs in a timely manner, or we otherwise do not effectively respond to changes in market dynamics, our businesses and financial performance could be materially and adversely affected. As a further example, specialty pharmacy represents a significant and growing proportion of prescription drug spending in the United States, a significant portion of which is dispensed outside of traditional retail pharmacies. Because our specialty pharmacy business focuses on complex and high-cost medications, many of which are made available by manufacturers to a limited number of pharmacies (so-called limited distribution drugs), that serve a relatively limited universe of patients, the future growth of this business depends to a significant extent upon expanding our ability to access key drugs and successfully penetrate key treatment categories. Accordingly, it is important that we and our affiliates compete effectively in this evolving market, or our business operations, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. To better serve this evolving market, in March 2017, we and Prime Therapeutics LLC, a PBM, closed a transaction to form a combined central specialty pharmacy and mail services company, AllianceRx Walgreens Prime, using an innovative model that seeks to align pharmacy, PBM and health plans to coordinate patient care, improve health outcomes and deliver cost of care opportunities. If this joint venture is not able to compete effectively in this evolving market and successfully adapt to changing market conditions, our business operations, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. Our substantial international business operations subject us to a number of operating, economic, political, regulatory and other international business risks. Our substantial international business operations are important to our growth and prospects, including particularly those of our Retail Pharmacy International and Pharmaceutical Wholesale divisions, and are subject to a number of risks, including: ##TABLE_START  compliance with a wide variety of foreign laws and regulations, including retail and wholesale pharmacy, licensing, tax, foreign trade, intellectual property, privacy and data protection, immigration, currency, political and other business restrictions and requirements and local laws and regulations, whose interpretation and enforcement vary significantly among jurisdictions and can change significantly over time; ##TABLE_END - 12 - ##TABLE_START  additional U.S. and other regulation of non-domestic operations, including regulation under the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the U.K. Bribery Act and other anti-corruption laws; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  potential difficulties in managing foreign operations, mitigating credit risks in foreign markets, enforcing agreements and collecting receivables through foreign legal systems; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  price controls imposed by foreign countries; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  tariffs, duties or other restrictions on foreign currencies or trade sanctions and other trade barriers imposed by foreign countries that restrict or prohibit business transactions in certain markets; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  potential adverse tax consequences, including tax withholding laws and policies and restrictions on repatriation of funds to the United States; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  fluctuations in currency exchange rates; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  impact of recessions and economic slowdowns in economies outside the United States, including foreign currency devaluation, higher interest rates, inflation, and increased government regulation or ownership of traditional private businesses; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  the instability of foreign economies, governments and currencies and unexpected regulatory, economic or political changes in foreign markets; and ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  developing and emerging markets may be especially vulnerable to periods of instability and unexpected changes, and consumers in those markets may have relatively limited resources to spend on products and services. ##TABLE_END These factors can also adversely affect our payers, vendors and customers in international markets, which in turn can negatively impact our businesses. We cannot assure you that one or more of these factors will not have a material adverse effect on our business operations, results of operation and financial condition. Many of these factors are subject to change based on changes in political, economic and regulatory influences. For example: ##TABLE_START  Our Retail Pharmacy International and Pharmaceutical Wholesale divisions have substantial operations in the United Kingdom and other member countries of the European Union. In June 2016, voters in the United Kingdom approved an advisory referendum to withdraw from the European Union, which proposed exit (and the political, economic and other uncertainties it has raised) has exacerbated and may further exacerbate many of the risks and uncertainties described above. Subsequently, in March 2017, the United Kingdoms government invoked Article 50 of the Treaty on European Union, which formally triggered the two-year negotiation process to exit the European Union. Negotiations to determine the United Kingdoms future relationship with the European Union, including terms of trade, are complex, and there can be no assurance regarding the terms, timing or consummation of any such arrangements. The proposed withdrawal could, among other potential outcomes, adversely affect the tax, tax treaty, currency, operational, legal and regulatory regimes to which our businesses in the region are subject. The withdrawal could also, among other potential outcomes, disrupt the free movement of goods, services and people between the United Kingdom and the European Union and significantly disrupt trade between the United Kingdom and the European Union and other parties. Further, uncertainty around and developments regarding these and related issues could adversely impact consumer and investor confidence and the economy of the United Kingdom and the economies of other countries in which we operate and cause significant volatility in currency exchange rates. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  Many of the products we sell are manufactured in whole or in part outside of the United States. In some cases, these products are imported by others and sold to us. In the United States, the Presidential Administration has discussed, and in some cases implemented, changes with respect to certain tax and trade policies, tariffs and other government regulations affecting trade between the United States and other countries. For example, there are growing concerns regarding trade relations between the United States and China, as both countries recently indicated their intention to impose significant tariffs on the importation of certain product categories. As a significant portion of our retail products are sourced from China, the imposition on the United States of new tariffs on certain goods imported from China could adversely impact the cost and profitability of retail product sales in our Retail Pharmacy USA division. While it is not possible to predict whether or when any future changes will occur or what form they may take, significant changes in tax or trade policies, tariffs or trade relations between the United States and other countries could result in significant increases in our costs, restrict our access to certain suppliers and adversely impact economic ##TABLE_END- 13 - activity. In addition, other countries may change their business and trade policies in anticipation of or in response to increased import tariffs and other changes in United States trade policy and regulations.  There can be no assurance that any or all of these developments will not have a material adverse effect on our business operations, results of operations and financial condition. We are exposed to risks associated with foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. Our significant operations outside of the United States expose us to currency exchange rate fluctuations and related risks, including transaction currency exposures relating to the import and export of goods in currencies other than businesses functional currencies as well as currency translation exposures relating to profits and net assets denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. We present our financial statements in U.S. dollars and have a significant proportion of net assets and income in non-U.S. dollar currencies, primarily the British pound sterling and the Euro, as well as a range of other foreign currencies. Our results of operations and capital ratios can therefore be sensitive to movements in foreign exchange rates. Due to the constantly changing currency exposures to which we are subject and the volatility of currency exchange rates, we cannot predict the effect of exchange rate fluctuations upon our future results of operations. In addition, fluctuations in currencies relative to the U.S. dollar may make it more difficult to perform period-to-period comparisons of our reported results of operations. A depreciation of non-U.S. dollar currencies relative to the U.S. dollar could have a significant adverse impact on our results of operations. We may from time to time, in some instances, enter into foreign currency contracts or other derivative instruments intended to hedge a portion of our foreign currency fluctuation risks, which subjects us to additional risks, such as the risk that counterparties may fail to honor their obligations to us, that could materially and adversely affect us. Additionally, we may (and currently do) use foreign currency debt to hedge some of our foreign currency fluctuation risks. The periodic use of such hedging activities may not offset any or more than a portion of the adverse financial effects of unfavorable movements in foreign exchange rates over the limited time the hedges are in place. We cannot assure you that fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, including particularly the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against major currencies or the currencies of large developing countries, will not materially affect our consolidated financial results. Disruption in our global supply chain could negatively impact our businesses. The products we sell are sourced from a wide variety of domestic and international vendors, and any future disruption in our supply chain or inability to find qualified vendors and access products that meet requisite quality and safety standards in a timely and efficient manner could adversely impact our businesses. The loss or disruption of such supply arrangements for any reason, including for issues such as labor disputes, loss or impairment of key manufacturing sites, inability to procure sufficient raw materials, quality control issues, ethical sourcing issues, a suppliers financial distress, natural disasters, civil unrest or acts of war or terrorism, trade sanctions or other external factors over which we have no control, could interrupt product supply and, if not effectively managed and remedied, have a material adverse impact on our business operations, financial condition and results of operations. We use a single wholesaler of branded and generic pharmaceutical drugs as our primary source of such products for our Retail Pharmacy USA division. In March 2013, Walgreens, Alliance Boots and AmerisourceBergen announced various agreements and arrangements, including a ten-year pharmaceutical distribution agreement between Walgreens and AmerisourceBergen pursuant to which we source branded and generic pharmaceutical products from AmerisourceBergen in the U.S. and an agreement which provides AmerisourceBergen the ability to access generics pharmaceutical products through our global sourcing enterprise. In May 2016, certain of these agreements were extended for three years to now expire in 2026. In addition, in March 2013, Walgreens, Alliance Boots and AmerisourceBergen entered into agreements and arrangements pursuant to which we have the right, but not the obligation, to purchase a minority equity position in AmerisourceBergen and gain associated representation on AmerisourceBergens board of directors in certain circumstances. As of the date of this report, AmerisourceBergen distributes for our Retail Pharmacy USA division substantially all branded and generic pharmaceutical products. Consequently, our business in the United States may be adversely affected by any operational, financial or regulatory difficulties that AmerisourceBergen experiences. For example, if AmerisourceBergens operations are seriously disrupted for any reason, whether due to a natural disaster, labor disruption, regulatory action, computer or operational systems or otherwise, it could adversely affect our business in the United States and our results of operations. Our distribution agreement with AmerisourceBergen is subject to early termination in certain circumstances and, upon the expiration or termination of the agreement, there can be no assurance that we or AmerisourceBergen will be willing to renew - 14 - the agreement or enter into a new agreement, on terms favorable to us or at all. If such expiration or termination occurred, we believe that alternative sources of supply for most generic and brand-name pharmaceuticals are readily available and that we could obtain and qualify alternative sources, which may include self-distribution in some cases, for substantially all of the prescription drugs we sell on an acceptable basis, such that the impact of any such expiration or termination would be temporary. However, there can be no assurance we would be able to engage alternative supply sources or implement self-distribution processes on a timely basis or on terms favorable to us, or effectively manage these transitions, any of which could adversely affect our business operations, financial condition and results of operations. The anticipated strategic and financial benefits of our relationship with AmerisourceBergen may not be realized. We entered into the arrangement with AmerisourceBergen with the expectation that the transactions contemplated thereby would result in various benefits including, among other things, procurement cost savings and operating efficiencies, innovation and sharing of best practices. The processes and initiatives needed to achieve these potential benefits are complex, costly and time-consuming. Achieving the anticipated benefits from the arrangement is subject to a number of significant challenges and uncertainties, including the possibility of faulty assumptions underlying expectations, processes or initiatives, or the inability to realize and/or delays in realizing potential benefits and synergies, whether unique corporate cultures of separate organizations will work collaboratively in an efficient and effective manner, unforeseen expenses or delays, and competitive factors in the marketplace. As of August 31, 2018, we beneficially owned approximately 26% of the outstanding AmerisourceBergen common stock and had designated one member of AmerisourceBergens board of directors. In addition, we have the right, but not the obligation, under the transactions contemplated by the Framework Agreement dated as of March 18, 2013 by and among the Company, Alliance Boots and AmerisourceBergen (the Framework Agreement) to acquire up to an additional 8,398,752 AmerisourceBergen shares in the open market and thereafter designate another member of AmerisourceBergens board of directors, subject in each case to applicable legal and contractual requirements. There can be no assurance that we will complete any specific level of such potential equity investments in AmerisourceBergen, or that our existing investment, or any future investment if completed, will ultimately be profitable. If the price of AmerisourceBergen common stock subsequently declines substantially, we could experience a loss on or impairment of such investment, which could materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. Further, our ability to transact in AmerisourceBergen securities is subject to certain restrictions set forth in our agreements with AmerisourceBergen and arising under applicable laws and regulations, which in some circumstances could adversely our ability to transact in AmerisourceBergen securities in amounts and at the times desired. We could also encounter unforeseen costs, circumstances or issues existing or arising with respect to the transactions and collaboration resulting from these agreements. Many of these potential circumstances are outside of our control and any of them could result in increased costs, decreased revenue, decreased synergies and the diversion of management time and attention. If we are unable to achieve our objectives within the anticipated time frame, or at all, the expected benefits may not be realized fully or at all, or may take longer to realize than expected, which could have a material adverse impact on our business operations, financial condition and results of operations. From time to time, we make investments in companies over which we do not have sole control. Some of these companies may operate in sectors that differ from our current operations and have different risks. From time to time, we make debt or equity investments in companies that we may not control or over which we may not have sole control. For example, while we have a significant equity investment in AmerisourceBergen and have a designee serving on the board of directors of AmerisourceBergen as of the date of this report, we do not have the ability to control day-to-day operations of that company. Although the businesses in which we have made noncontrolling investments often have a significant health and daily living or prescription drug component, some of them operate in businesses that are different from our primary lines of business and/or operate in different geographic markets than we do. For example, in July 2018, we acquired a 40% minority stake in Sinopharm Holding GuoDa Drugstores Co., Ltd., a leading retail pharmacy chain in China. Investments in these businesses, among other risks, subject us to the operating and financial risks of the businesses we invest in and to the risk that we do not have sole control over the operations of these businesses. We rely on the internal controls and financial reporting controls of these entities and their failure to maintain effectiveness or comply with applicable standards may materially and adversely affect us. Investments in entities over which we do not have sole control, including joint ventures and strategic alliances, present additional risks such as having differing objectives from our partners or the entities in which we are invested, becoming involved in disputes, or competing with those persons. From time to time, we may make additional investments in or acquire other entities that may subject us to similar risks. Changes in economic conditions could adversely affect consumer buying practices. - 15 - Our performance has been, and may continue to be, adversely impacted by changes in global, national, regional or local economic conditions and consumer confidence. These conditions can also adversely affect our key vendors and customers. External factors that affect consumer confidence and over which we exercise no influence include unemployment rates, inflation, levels of personal disposable income, levels of taxes and interest and global, national, regional or local economic conditions, as well as acts of war or terrorism. Changes in economic conditions and consumer confidence could adversely affect consumer preferences, purchasing power and spending patterns, which could lead to a decrease in overall consumer spending as well as in prescription drug and health services utilization and which could be exacerbated by the increasing prevalence of high-deductible health insurance plans and related plan design changes. In addition, reduced or flat consumer spending may drive us and our competitors to offer additional products at promotional prices. All of these factors could materially and adversely impact our business operations, financial condition and results of operations. Economic conditions in Europe and certain emerging market countries, together with austerity measures being taken by certain governments, could adversely affect us. We have significant assets and operations within Europe and certain emerging market countries in our Retail Pharmacy International and Pharmaceutical Wholesale divisions. An economic slowdown within any such markets could adversely affect our businesses in affected regions by reducing the prices our customers may be able or willing to pay for our products and services or by reducing the demand for our products and services, either of which could result in a material adverse impact on our results of operations. In recent years, in response to the economic environment, a number of governments, including the government in the United Kingdom, have announced or implemented austerity measures to reduce healthcare spending for the government-sponsored healthcare systems and constrain overall government expenditures. These measures, which include efforts aimed at reforming healthcare coverage and reducing healthcare costs, continue to exert pressure on the pricing of and reimbursement timelines for pharmaceutical drugs. Countries with existing austerity measures may impose additional laws, regulations, or requirements on the healthcare industry. In addition, governments that have not yet imposed austerity measures may impose them in the future. Any new austerity measures may be similar to or vary in scope and nature from existing austerity measures and could have a material adverse effect on our international business operations and results of operations. If we do not successfully develop and maintain a relevant omni-channel experience for our customers, our businesses and results of operations could be adversely impacted. The portion of total consumer expenditures with retailers occurring online and through mobile applications has continued to increase and the pace of this increase could accelerate in the future. Our business has evolved from an in-store experience to interaction with customers across numerous channels, including in-store, online, mobile and social media, among others. Omni-channel retailing is rapidly evolving and we must keep pace with changing customer expectations and new developments by our competitors. Our customers are increasingly using computers, tablets, mobile phones, and other devices to comparison shop, determine product availability and complete purchases, as well as to provide immediate public reactions regarding various facets of our operations. We must compete by offering a consistent and convenient shopping experience for our customers regardless of the ultimate sales channel and by investing in, providing and maintaining digital tools for our customers that have the right features and are reliable and easy to use. If we are unable to make, improve, or develop relevant customer-facing technology in a timely manner that keeps pace with technological developments and dynamic customer expectations, our ability to compete and our results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. In addition, if our online activities or our other customer-facing technology systems do not function as designed, we may experience a loss of customer confidence, data security breaches, lost sales, or be exposed to fraudulent purchases, any of which could materially and adversely affect our business operations, reputation and results of operations. If the merchandise and services that we offer fail to meet customer needs, our sales may be adversely affected. We could be adversely affected by changes in consumer spending levels and shopping habits and preferences, including attitudes towards our retail and product brands. The success of our retail pharmacy businesses depends on our ability to offer a superior shopping experience, engaging customer service and a quality assortment of available merchandise that differentiates us from other retailers, including enhanced health and beauty product offerings. We must identify, obtain supplies of, and offer to our customers attractive, innovative and high-quality merchandise on a continuous basis. Our products and services must satisfy the needs and desires of our customers, whose preferences may change in the future. For example, our proof of concept initiatives that seek to position our stores in the United States as convenient community hubs for healthcare and retail products and services reflect the perceived desires and needs of our target market. However, it is difficult to predict consistently and successfully the products and services our customers will demand. If we misjudge either the demand for products and services we sell or our customers purchasing habits and tastes, we may be faced with excess inventories of some products and missed opportunities for products and services we chose not to offer. In addition, our sales may decline or we may be required to sell the merchandise we have obtained at lower prices. Failure to timely identify or effectively respond to changing consumer - 16 - tastes, preferences and spending patterns and evolving demographic mixes in the markets we serve could negatively affect our relationship with our customers and the demand for our products and services, which could materially and adversely impact our results of operations. Our private brand offerings expose us to various additional risks. In addition to brand name products, we offer our customers private brand products that are not available from other retailers. We seek to continue to grow our exclusive private brand offerings as part of our growth strategy, including through the expanded offering of No7 and other brands owned or licensed on an exclusive basis, as well as through selective acquisitions. Maintaining consistent product quality, competitive pricing, and availability of our private brand offerings for our customers, as well as the timely development and introduction of new products, is important in differentiating us from other retailers and developing and maintaining customer loyalty. Although we believe that our private brand products offer value to our customers and typically provide us with higher gross margins than comparable national brand products we sell, the expansion of our private brand offerings also subjects us to additional risks, such as potential product liability risks and mandatory or voluntary product recalls; our ability to successfully protect our proprietary rights and successfully navigate and avoid claims related to the proprietary rights of third parties; our ability to successfully administer and comply with applicable contractual obligations and regulatory requirements; and other risks generally encountered by entities that source, sell and market exclusive branded offerings for retail. An increase in sales of our private brands may also adversely affect sales of our vendors products, which, in turn, could adversely affect our relationship with certain of our vendors. Any failure to adequately address some or all of these risks could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, business operations, results of operations and financial condition. We face significant competition in attracting and retaining talented employees. Further, managing succession for, and retention of, key executives is critical to our success, and our failure to do so could have an adverse impact on our future performance.  Our ability to attract and retain qualified and experienced employees is essential to meet current and future goals and objectives and there is no guarantee we will be able to attract and retain such employees or that competition among potential employers will not result in increased salaries or other benefits. An inability to retain existing employees or attract additional employees, or an unexpected loss of leadership, could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.  In addition, our failure to adequately plan for succession of senior management and other key management roles or the failure of key employees to successfully transition into new roles could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. While we have succession plans in place and employment arrangements with certain key executives, these do not guarantee the services of these executives will continue to be available to us. We may experience a significant disruption in our computer systems. We rely extensively on our computer systems to manage our ordering, pricing, point-of-sale, pharmacy fulfillment, inventory replenishment, customer loyalty programs, finance and other processes. Our systems are subject to damage or interruption from power outages, facility damage, computer and telecommunications failures, computer viruses, security breaches including credit card or personally identifiable information breaches, vandalism, natural disasters, catastrophic events, human error and potential cyber threats, including malicious codes, worms, phishing attacks, denial of service attacks, ransomware and other sophisticated cyber attacks, and our disaster recovery planning cannot account for all eventualities. If any of our systems are damaged, fail to function properly or otherwise become unavailable, we may incur substantial costs to repair or replace them, and may experience loss or corruption of critical data and interruptions or disruptions and delays in our ability to perform critical functions, which could materially and adversely affect our businesses and results of operations. In addition, we are currently making, and expect to continue to make, substantial investments in our information technology systems and infrastructure, some of which are significant. Upgrades involve replacing existing systems with successor systems, making changes to existing systems, or cost-effectively acquiring new systems with new functionality. Implementing new systems carries significant potential risks, including failure to operate as designed, potential loss or corruption of data or information, cost overruns, implementation delays, disruption of operations, and the potential inability to meet business and reporting requirements. While we are aware of inherent risks associated with replacing these systems and believe we are taking reasonable action to mitigate known risks, there can be no assurance that we will not experience significant issues with our existing systems prior to implementation, that our technology initiatives will be successfully deployed as planned or that they will be timely implemented without significant disruption to our operations. We also could be adversely affected by any significant disruption in the systems of third parties we interact with, including key payers and vendors. - 17 - If we or the businesses we interact with do not maintain the privacy and security of sensitive customer and business information, it could damage our reputation and we could suffer a loss of revenue, incur substantial additional costs and become subject to litigation and regulatory scrutiny. The protection of customer, employee, and company data is critical to our businesses. Cybersecurity and other information technology security risks, such as a significant breach of customer, employee, or company data, could attract a substantial amount of media attention, damage our customer relationships and reputation, and result in lost sales, fines or lawsuits. Throughout our operations, we receive, retain and transmit certain personal information that our customers and others provide to purchase products or services, fill prescriptions, enroll in promotional programs, participate in our customer loyalty programs, register on our websites, or otherwise communicate and interact with us. In addition, aspects of our operations depend upon the secure transmission of confidential information over public networks. Like other global companies, we and businesses we interact with have experienced threats to data and systems, including by perpetrators of random or targeted malicious cyberattacks, computer viruses, worms, bot attacks or other destructive or disruptive software and attempts to misappropriate customer information, including credit card information, and cause system failures and disruptions. Although we deploy a layered approach to address information security threats and vulnerabilities designed to protect confidential information against data security breaches, a compromise of our data security systems or of those of businesses with whom we interact, which results in confidential information being accessed, obtained, damaged or used by unauthorized or improper persons, could harm our reputation and expose us to regulatory actions, customer attrition, remediation expenses, and claims from customers, financial institutions, payment card associations and other persons, any of which could materially and adversely affect our business operations, financial condition and results of operations. Because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access, disable or degrade service, or sabotage systems change frequently and may not immediately produce signs of intrusion, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures. In addition, a security breach could require that we expend substantial additional resources related to the security of information systems and disrupt our businesses. We depend on and interact with the information technology networks and systems of third-parties for many aspects of our business operations, including payers, strategic partners and cloud service providers. These third parties may have access to information we maintain about our company, operations, customers, employees and vendors, or operating systems that are critical to or can significantly impact our business operations. Like us, these third-parties are subject to risks imposed by data breaches and cyber-attacks and other events or actions that could damage, disrupt or close down their networks or systems. Security processes, protocols and standards that we have implemented and contractual provisions requiring security measures that we may have sought to impose on such third-parties may not be sufficient or effective at preventing such events, which could result in unauthorized access to, or disruptions or denials of access to, or misuse of, information or systems that are important to our business, including proprietary information, sensitive or confidential data, and other information about our operations, customers, employees and suppliers, including personal information. The regulatory environment surrounding data security and privacy is increasingly demanding, with the frequent imposition of new and changing requirements across businesses and geographic areas. We are required to comply with increasingly complex and changing data security and privacy regulations in the United States and in other jurisdictions in which we operate that regulate the collection, use and transfer of personal data, including the transfer of personal data between or among countries. In the United States, for example, HIPAA imposes extensive privacy and security requirements governing the transmission, use and disclosure of health information by all participants in the health care industry. Some foreign data privacy regulations are more stringent than those in the United States and continue to change. For example, the European Unions General Data Protection Regulation, which greatly increased the jurisdictional reach of European Union data protection laws and added a broad array of requirements for handling personal data, including the public disclosure of significant data breaches, and provides for greater penalties for noncompliance, became effective in May 2018. Other countries have enacted or are considering enacting data localization laws that require certain data to stay within their borders. Complying with changing regulatory requirements requires us to incur substantial costs and may require changes to our business practices in certain jurisdictions, any of which could materially and adversely affect our business operations and operating results. We may also face audits or investigations by one or more domestic or foreign government agencies relating to our compliance with these regulations. Compliance with changes in privacy and information security laws and standards may result in significant expense due to increased investment in technology and the development of new operational processes. If we or those with whom we share information fail to comply with these laws and regulations or experience a data security breach, our reputation could be damaged and we could be subject to additional litigation and regulatory risks. Our security measures may be undermined due to the actions of outside parties, employee error, malfeasance, or otherwise, and, as a result, an unauthorized party may obtain access to our data systems and misappropriate business and personal information. Any such breach or unauthorized access could result in significant legal and financial exposure, damage to our reputation, and potentially have a material adverse effect on our business operations, financial condition and results of operations. - 18 - We are subject to payment-related risks that could increase our operating costs, expose us to fraud or theft, subject us to potential liability and potentially disrupt our business operations. We accept payments using a variety of methods, including cash, checks, credit and debit cards, gift cards and mobile payment technologies such as Apple Pay, and we may offer new payment options over time. Acceptance of these payment options subjects us to rules, regulations, contractual obligations and compliance requirements, including payment network rules and operating guidelines, data security standards and certification requirements, and rules governing electronic funds transfers. These requirements and related interpretations may change over time, which could make compliance more difficult or costly. For certain payment methods, including credit and debit cards, we pay interchange and other fees, which could increase over time and raise our operating costs. We rely on third parties to provide payment processing services, including the processing of credit cards, debit cards, and other forms of electronic payment. If these companies become unable to provide these services to us, or if their systems are compromised, it could disrupt our business. The payment methods that we offer also subject us to potential fraud and theft by persons who seek to obtain unauthorized access to or exploit any weaknesses that may exist in the payment systems. If we fail to comply with applicable rules or requirements, or if data is compromised due to a breach or misuse of data relating to our payment systems, we may be liable for costs incurred by payment card issuing banks and other third parties or subject to fines and higher transaction fees, or our ability to accept or facilitate certain types of payments could be impaired. In addition, our reputation could suffer and our customers could lose confidence in certain payment types, which could result in higher costs and/or reduced sales and materially and adversely affect our results of operations. Changes in healthcare regulatory environments may adversely affect our businesses. Political, economic and regulatory influences are subjecting the healthcare industry to significant changes that could adversely affect our results of operations. In recent years, the healthcare industry has undergone significant changes in an effort to reduce costs and government spending. These changes include an increased reliance on managed care; cuts in certain Medicare and Medicaid funding in the United States and the funding of governmental payers in foreign jurisdictions; consolidation of competitors, suppliers and other market participants; and the development of large, sophisticated purchasing groups. We expect the healthcare industry to continue to change significantly in the future. Some of these potential changes, such as a reduction in governmental funding for certain healthcare services or adverse changes in legislation or regulations governing prescription drug pricing, healthcare services or mandated benefits, may cause customers to reduce the amount of our products and services they purchase or the price they are willing to pay for our products and services. We expect continued governmental and private payer pressure to reduce pharmaceutical pricing. Changes in pharmaceutical manufacturers pricing or distribution policies could also significantly reduce our profitability. In the United States, electoral results and changes in political leadership have generated uncertainty with respect to, and could result in, significant changes in legislation, regulation and government policy that could significantly impact our businesses and the health care and retail industries. There have been multiple attempts to repeal, modify or otherwise invalidate all, or certain provisions of, the ACA, which was enacted in 2010 to provide health insurance coverage to millions of previously uninsured Americans through a combination of insurance market reforms, an expansion of Medicaid, subsidies and health insurance mandates. We cannot predict whether current or future efforts to modify these laws and/or adopt new healthcare legislation will be successful, nor can we predict the impact that such a development would have on our business and operating results. Future legislation or rulemaking or other regulatory actions or developments under the ACA or otherwise could adversely impact the number of Americans with health insurance and, consequently, prescription drug coverage, increase regulation of pharmacy services, result in changes to pharmacy reimbursement rates, and otherwise change the way we do business. We cannot predict the timing or impact of any future legislative, rulemaking or other regulatory actions, but any such actions could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations. A significant change in, or noncompliance with, governmental regulations and other legal requirements could have a material adverse effect on our reputation and profitability. We operate in complex, highly regulated environments around the world and could be materially and adversely affected by changes to applicable legal requirements including the related interpretations and enforcement practices, new legal requirements and/or any failure to comply with applicable regulations. Businesses in our Pharmaceutical Wholesale division are subject to a range of regulations relating to such things as product margins, product traceability and the conditions under which products must be stored. Our retail pharmacy and health and wellness services businesses are subject to numerous country, state and local regulations including licensing and other requirements for pharmacies and reimbursement arrangements. The regulations to which we are subject include, but are not limited to: country and state registration and regulation of pharmacies and drug discount card programs; dispensing and sale of controlled substances and products containing pseudoephedrine; applicable governmental payer regulations including Medicare and Medicaid; data privacy and security laws and regulations including HIPAA; the ACA or any successor thereto; laws and regulations relating to the - 19 - protection of the environment and health and safety matters, including those governing exposure to, and the management and disposal of, hazardous substances; regulations regarding food and drug safety including those of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), trade regulations including those of the U.S. Federal Trade Commission, and consumer protection and safety regulations including those of the Consumer Product Safety Commission, as well as state regulatory authorities, governing the availability, sale, advertisement and promotion of products we sell as well as our loyalty and drug discount card programs; anti-kickback laws; false claims laws; laws against the corporate practice of medicine; and foreign, national and state laws governing health care fraud and abuse and the practice of the profession of pharmacy. For example, in the United States the DEA, FDA and various other regulatory authorities regulate the distribution and dispensing of pharmaceuticals and controlled substances. We are required to hold valid DEA and state-level licenses, meet various security and operating standards and comply with the federal and various state controlled substance acts and related regulations governing the sale, dispensing, disposal, holding and distribution of controlled substances. The DEA, FDA and state regulatory authorities have broad enforcement powers, including the ability to seize or recall products and impose significant criminal, civil and administrative sanctions for violations of these laws and regulations. We are also governed by foreign, national and state laws of general applicability, including laws regulating matters of working conditions, health and safety and equal employment opportunity and other labor and employment matters as well as employee benefit, competition and antitrust matters. In addition, we could have significant exposure if we are found to have infringed another partys intellectual property rights. Changes in laws, regulations and policies and the related interpretations and enforcement practices may alter the landscape in which we do business and may significantly affect our cost of doing business. The impact of new laws, regulations and policies and the related interpretations and enforcement practices generally cannot be predicted, and changes in applicable laws, regulations and policies and the related interpretations and enforcement practices may require extensive system and operational changes, be difficult to implement, increase our operating costs and require significant capital expenditures. Untimely compliance or noncompliance with applicable laws and regulations could result in the imposition of civil and criminal penalties that could adversely affect the continued operation of our businesses, including: suspension of payments from government programs; loss of required government certifications; loss of authorizations to participate in or exclusion from government programs, including the Medicare and Medicaid programs in the United States and the National Health Service in the United Kingdom; loss of licenses; and significant fines or monetary penalties. Any failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements in the United States or in any of the countries in which we operate could result in significant legal and financial exposure, damage our reputation, and have a material adverse effect on our business operations, financial condition and results of operations. We could be adversely affected by product liability, product recall, personal injury or other health and safety issues. We could be adversely impacted by the supply of defective or expired products, including the infiltration of counterfeit products into the supply chain, errors in re-labeling of products, product tampering, product recall and contamination or product mishandling issues. Through our pharmacies and specialist packaging sites, we are also exposed to risks relating to the services we provide. Errors in the dispensing and packaging of pharmaceuticals, including related counseling, and in the provision of other healthcare services could lead to serious injury or death. Product liability or personal injury claims may be asserted against us with respect to any of the products or pharmaceuticals we sell or services we provide. Our healthcare clinics also increase our exposure to professional liability claims related to medical care. Should a product or other liability issue arise, the coverage limits under our insurance programs and the indemnification amounts available to us may not be adequate to protect us against claims and judgments. We also may not be able to maintain this insurance on acceptable terms in the future. We could suffer significant reputational damage and financial liability if we, or any affiliated entities, experience any of the foregoing health and safety issues or incidents, which could have a material adverse effect on our business operations, financial condition and results of operations. We have significant outstanding debt; our debt and associated payment obligations could significantly increase in the future if we incur additional debt and do not retire existing debt. We have outstanding debt and other financial obligations and significant unused borrowing capacity. As of August 31, 2018, we had approximately $14 billion of outstanding indebtedness, including short-term debt. Our debt level and related debt service obligations could have negative consequences, including: ##TABLE_START  requiring us to dedicate significant cash flow from operations to the payment of principal, interest and other amounts payable on our debt, which would reduce the funds we have available for other purposes, such as working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, share repurchases and dividends; ##TABLE_END - 20 - ##TABLE_START  making it more difficult or expensive for us to obtain any necessary future financing for working capital, capital expenditures, debt service requirements, debt refinancing, acquisitions or other purposes; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  reducing our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our industry and market conditions; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  making us more vulnerable in the event of a downturn in our business operations; and ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  exposing us to interest rate risk given that a portion of our debt obligations is at variable interest rates. ##TABLE_END We may incur or assume significantly more debt in the future, including in connection with acquisitions, strategic investments or joint ventures. If we add new debt and do not retire existing debt, the risks described above could increase. We also could be adversely impacted by any failure to renew or replace, on terms acceptable to us or at all, existing funding arrangements when they expire, and any failure to satisfy applicable covenants. Our long-term debt obligations include covenants that may adversely affect our ability, and the ability of certain of our subsidiaries, to incur certain secured indebtedness or engage in certain types of transactions. In addition, our existing credit agreements require us to maintain as of the last day of each fiscal quarter a ratio of consolidated debt to total capitalization not to exceed a certain level. Our ability to comply with these restrictions and covenants may be affected by events beyond our control. If we breach any of these restrictions or covenants and do not obtain a waiver from the lenders, then, subject to applicable cure periods, our outstanding indebtedness could be declared immediately due and payable. This could have a material adverse effect on our business operations and financial condition. We could be adversely affected by downgrades to our credit ratings or disruptions in our ability to access well-functioning capital markets. Historically, we have relied on the public debt capital markets to fund portions of our capital investments and access to the commercial paper market and bank credit facilities as part of our working capital management strategy. Our continued access to these markets, and the terms of such access, depend on multiple factors including the condition of debt capital markets, our operating performance, and our credit ratings. The major credit rating agencies have assigned us and our corporate debt investment grade credit ratings. These ratings are based on a number of factors, which include their assessment of our financial strength and financial policies. We benefit from investment grade ratings as they serve to lower our borrowing costs and facilitate our access to a variety of lenders and other creditors, including landlords for our leased stores, on terms that we consider advantageous to our businesses. However, there can be no assurance that any particular rating assigned to us will remain in effect for any given period of time or that a rating will not be changed or withdrawn by a rating agency, if in that rating agencys judgment, future circumstances relating to the basis of the rating so warrant. Incurrence of additional debt by us could adversely affect our credit ratings. We depend on banks and other financial institutions to provide credit to our business and perform under our agreements with them. Defaults by one or more of these counterparties on their obligations to us could materially and adversely affect us. Any disruptions or turmoil in the capital markets or any downgrade of our credit ratings could adversely affect our cost of funds, liquidity, competitive position and access to capital markets and increase the cost of and counterparty risks associated with existing facilities, which could materially and adversely affect our business operations, financial condition, and results of operations. We may be unable to keep existing store locations or open new locations in desirable places on favorable terms, which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations. We compete with other retailers and businesses for suitable locations for our stores. Local land use and zoning regulations, environmental regulations and other regulatory requirements may impact our ability to find suitable locations and influence the cost of constructing, renovating and operating our stores. In addition, real estate, zoning, construction and other delays may adversely affect store openings and renovations and increase our costs. Further, changing local demographics at existing store locations may adversely affect revenue and profitability levels at those stores. The termination or expiration of leases at existing store locations may adversely affect us if the renewal terms of those leases are unacceptable to us and we are forced to close or relocate stores. If we determine to close or relocate a store subject to a lease, we may remain obligated under the applicable lease for the balance of the lease term. If we are unable to maintain our existing store locations or open new locations in desirable places and on favorable terms, our results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. As a holding company, Walgreens Boots Alliance is dependent on funding from its operating subsidiaries to pay dividends and other obligations. - 21 - Walgreens Boots Alliance is a holding company with no business operations of its own. Its assets primarily consist of direct and indirect ownership interests in, and its business is conducted through, subsidiaries which are separate legal entities. As a result, it is dependent on funding from its subsidiaries, including Walgreens and Alliance Boots, to meet its obligations. Additionally, Walgreens Boots Alliances subsidiaries may be restricted in their ability to pay cash dividends or to make other distributions to Walgreens Boots Alliance, which may limit the payment of cash dividends or other distributions to the holders of Walgreens Boots Alliance common stock. Credit facilities and other debt obligations of Walgreens Boots Alliance, as well as statutory provisions, may further limit the ability of Walgreens Boots Alliance and its subsidiaries to pay dividends. Payments to Walgreens Boots Alliance by its subsidiaries are also contingent upon its subsidiaries earnings and business considerations. Future Walgreens Boots Alliance dividends will be determined based on earnings, capital requirements, financial condition and other factors considered relevant by its Board of Directors. Our quarterly results may fluctuate significantly. Our operating results have historically varied on a quarterly basis and may continue to fluctuate significantly in the future. Factors that may affect our quarterly operating results, some of which are beyond the control of management, include, but are not limited to the timing of the introduction of new generic and brand name prescription drugs; inflation, including with respect to generic drug procurement costs; the timing and severity of the cough, cold and flu season; changes in payer reimbursement rates and terms; fluctuations in inventory, energy, transportation, labor, healthcare and other costs; significant acquisitions, dispositions, joint ventures and other strategic initiatives; asset impairment charges; the relative magnitude of our LIFO provision in any particular quarter; foreign currency fluctuations; seasonality; prolonged severe weather in key markets; and many of the other risk factors discussed herein. Accordingly, we believe that quarter-to-quarter comparisons of our operating results are not necessarily meaningful and investors should not rely on the results of any particular quarter as an indication of our future performance. Our businesses are seasonal in nature, and adverse events during the holiday and cough, cold and flu seasons could adversely impact our operating results. Our businesses are seasonal in nature, with the second fiscal quarter (December, January and February) typically generating a higher proportion of retail sales and earnings than other fiscal quarters. We purchase significant amounts of seasonal inventory in anticipation of the holiday season. Adverse events, such as deteriorating economic conditions, higher unemployment, higher gas prices, public transportation disruptions, or unanticipated adverse weather, could result in lower-than-planned sales during key selling seasons. For example, frequent or unusually heavy snowfall, ice storms, rainstorms, windstorms or other extreme weather conditions over a prolonged period could make it difficult for our customers to travel to our stores and increase our snow removal and other costs. This could lead to lower sales or to unanticipated markdowns, negatively impacting our financial condition and results of operations. In addition, both prescription and non-prescription drug sales are affected by the timing and severity of the cough, cold and flu season, which can vary considerably from year to year. We could be adversely impacted by changes in accounting standards and subjective assumptions, estimates and judgments by management related to complex accounting matters. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) and related accounting pronouncements, implementation guidelines and interpretations with regard to a wide range of matters that are relevant to our businesses, including, but not limited to, revenue recognition, asset impairment, impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets, inventories, equity method investments, vendor rebates and other vendor consideration, lease obligations, self-insurance liabilities, pension and postretirement benefits, tax matters, unclaimed property laws and litigation and other contingent liabilities are highly complex and involve many subjective assumptions, estimates and judgments. Changes in these rules or their interpretation or changes in underlying assumptions, estimates or judgments could significantly change our reported or expected financial performance or financial condition. For example, changes in accounting standards and the application of existing accounting standards particularly related to the measurement of fair value as compared to carrying value for the Companys reporting units, including goodwill, intangible assets and investments in equity interests, including investments held by our equity method investees, may have an adverse effect on the Companys financial condition and results of operations. Factors that could lead to impairment of goodwill and intangible assets include significant adverse changes in the business climate and declines in the financial condition of a reporting unit. Factors that could lead to impairment of investments in equity interests of the companies in which we invested or the investments held by those companies include a prolonged period of decline in their operating performance or adverse changes in the economic, regulatory and legal environments of the countries in which they operate in. New accounting guidance also may require changes to our processes, accounting systems and internal controls that could increase our operating costs and/or significantly change our financial statements. For example, in February 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842), which - 22 - supersedes Topic 840, Leases. This ASU, which is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2018 (fiscal 2020), seeks to increase the transparency and comparability of organizations by recognizing operating lease assets and operating lease liabilities on the balance sheet and disclosing key information about leasing arrangements. See, new accounting pronouncements, within note 1 , summary of major accounting policies , to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Implementing this ASU, as well as other new accounting guidance may require us to make significant upgrades to and investments in our lease administration systems and other accounting systems, and could result in significant adverse changes to our financial statements. We have a substantial amount of goodwill and other intangible assets which could, in the future, become impaired and result in material non-cash charges to our results of operations. As of August 31, 2018, we had $28.7 billion of goodwill and other intangible assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. We evaluate this goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment annually during the fourth quarter, or more frequently if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value. As part of this impairment analysis, we determine fair value for each reporting unit using both the income and market approaches. Definite-lived intangible assets are evaluated for impairment if an event occurs or circumstances change that indicate the carrying amount may not be recoverable. Estimated fair values could change if, for example, there are changes in the business climate, changes in the competitive environment, adverse legal or regulatory actions or developments, changes in capital structure, cost of debt, interest rates, capital expenditure levels, operating cash flows, or market capitalization. Because of the significance of our goodwill and intangible assets, any future impairment of these assets could require material non-cash charges to our results of operations, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. We are exposed to risks related to litigation and other legal proceedings. We operate in a highly regulated and litigious environment. We are involved in legal proceedings, including litigation, arbitration and other claims, and investigations, inspections, audits, claims, inquiries and similar actions by pharmacy, healthcare, tax and other governmental authorities, including those contained in note 10 , commitments and contingencies , to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in part II, item 8 of this Form 10-K. Legal proceedings, in general, and securities, class action and multi-district litigation, in particular, can be expensive and disruptive. Some of these suits may purport or may be determined to be class actions and/or involve parties seeking large and/or indeterminate amounts, including punitive or exemplary damages, and may remain unresolved for several years. In addition, under the qui tam or whistleblower provisions of the federal and various state false claims acts, persons may bring lawsuits alleging that a violation of the federal anti-kickback statute or similar laws has resulted in the submission of false claims to federal and/or state healthcare programs, including Medicare and Medicaid. After a private party has filed a qui tam action, the government must investigate the private party's claim and determine whether to intervene in and take control over the litigation. These actions may remain under seal while the government makes this determination. From time to time, the Company is also involved in legal proceedings as a plaintiff involving antitrust, tax, contract, intellectual property and other matters. We cannot predict with certainty the outcomes of these legal proceedings and other contingencies, and the costs incurred in litigation can be substantial, regardless of the outcome. Substantial unanticipated verdicts, fines and rulings do sometimes occur. As a result, we could from time to time incur judgments, enter into settlements or revise our expectations regarding the outcome of certain matters, and such developments could harm our reputation and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in the period in which the amounts are accrued and/or our cash flows in the period in which the amounts are paid. The outcome of some of these legal proceedings and other contingencies could require us to take, or refrain from taking, actions which could negatively affect our operations. Additionally, defending against these lawsuits and proceedings may involve significant expense and diversion of managements attention and resources. We could be adversely affected by violations of anti-bribery, anti-corruption and/or international trade laws. We are subject to laws concerning our business operations and marketing activities in foreign countries where we conduct business. For example, we are subject to the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (the FCPA), U.S. export control, anti-money laundering and trade sanction laws, and similar anti-corruption and international trade laws in certain foreign countries, such as the U.K. Bribery Act, any violation of which could create substantial liability for us and also harm our reputation. The FCPA generally prohibits U.S. companies and their officers, directors, employees, and intermediaries from making improper payments to foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business abroad or otherwise obtaining favorable treatment. The FCPA also requires that U.S. public companies maintain books and records that fairly and accurately reflect transactions and maintain an adequate system of internal accounting controls. If we are found to have violated the FCPA, or any other anti-bribery, anti-corruption or international trade laws, we may face sanctions including civil and criminal fines, disgorgement of profits, and suspension or debarment of our ability to contract with governmental agencies or receive export - 23 - licenses. In addition, new initiatives may be proposed from time to time that impact the trading conditions in certain countries or regions, and may include retaliatory duties or trade sanctions which, if enacted, could adversely impact our trading relationships with vendors or other parties in such locations and have a material adverse effect on our operations. From time to time, we may face audits or investigations by one or more domestic or foreign governmental agencies relating to our international business activities, compliance with which could be costly and time-consuming, and could divert our management and key personnel from our business operations. An adverse outcome under any such investigation or audit could damage our reputation and subject us to fines or other penalties, which could materially and adversely affect our business operations, financial condition, and results of operations. We could be subject to adverse changes in tax laws, regulations and interpretations or challenges to our tax positions. We are a large corporation with operations in the U.S. and numerous other jurisdictions around the world. As such, we are subject to tax laws and regulations of the U.S. federal, state and local governments as well as various foreign jurisdictions. We compute our income tax provision based on enacted tax rates in the jurisdictions in which we operate. As the tax rates vary among jurisdictions, a change in earnings attributable to the various jurisdictions in which we operate could result in an unfavorable change in our overall tax provision. From time to time, changes in tax laws or regulations may be proposed or enacted that could adversely affect our overall tax liability. For example, the U.S. tax legislation enacted on December 22, 2017 represents a significant overhaul of the U.S. federal tax code. This tax legislation significantly reduced the U.S. statutory corporate tax rate and made other changes that could have a favorable impact on our overall U.S. federal tax liability in a given period. However, the tax legislation also included a number of provisions, including, but not limited to, the limitation or elimination of various deductions or credits (including for interest expense and for performance-based compensation under Section 162(m)), the imposition of taxes on certain cross-border payments or transfers, the changing of the timing of the recognition of certain income and deductions or their character, and the limitation of asset basis under certain circumstances, that could significantly and adversely affect our U.S. federal income tax position. The legislation also made significant changes to the tax rules applicable to insurance companies and other entities with which we do business. We are continuing to evaluate the overall impact of this tax legislation on our operations and U.S. federal income tax position. There can be no assurance that changes in tax laws or regulations, both within the U.S. and the other jurisdictions in which we operate, will not materially and adversely affect our effective tax rate, tax payments, financial condition and results of operations. Similarly, changes in tax laws and regulations that impact our customers and counterparties or the economy generally may also impact our financial condition and results of operations. Tax laws and regulations are complex and subject to varying interpretations, and we are subject to regular review and audit by both domestic and foreign tax authorities. Any adverse outcome of such a review or audit could have a negative impact on our effective tax rate, tax payments, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, the determination of our income tax provision and other tax liabilities requires significant judgment, and there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. Although we believe our estimates are reasonable, the ultimate tax determination may differ from the amounts recorded in our financial statements and may materially affect our results of operations in the period or periods for which such determination is made. Any significant failure to comply with applicable tax laws and regulations in all relevant jurisdictions could give rise to substantial penalties and liabilities. Any changes in enacted tax laws (such as the recent U.S. tax legislation), rules or regulatory or judicial interpretations; or any change in the pronouncements relating to accounting for income taxes could materially and adversely impact our effective tax rate, tax payments, financial condition and results of operations. Our insurance strategies may expose us to unexpected costs. We use a combination of insurance and self-insurance to provide for potential liability for workers compensation; automobile and general liability; property, director and officers liability; and employee healthcare benefits. Provisions for losses related to self-insured risks generally are based upon actuarially determined estimates. Any actuarial projection of losses is subject to a high degree of variability. Substantial, unanticipated losses or liabilities, including those due to natural disasters or otherwise, as well as changes in legal claims, trends and interpretations, variability in inflation rates, changes in the nature and method of claims settlement, benefit level changes due to changes in applicable laws, insolvency of insurance carriers, and changes in discount rates could all materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. We could be adversely impacted by changes in assumptions used in calculating pension assets and liabilities. We operate certain defined benefit pension plans in the United Kingdom, which were closed to new entrants in 2010, as well as smaller plans in other jurisdictions. The valuation of the pension plans assets and liabilities depends in part on assumptions, which are primarily based on the financial markets as well as longevity and employee retention rates. This valuation is - 24 - particularly sensitive to material changes in the value of equity, bond and other investments held by the pension plans, changes in the corporate bond yields which are used in the measurement of the liabilities, changes in market expectations for long-term price inflation, and new evidence on projected longevity rates. Funding requirements and the impact on the statement of earnings relating to these pension plans are also influenced by these factors. Adverse changes in the assumptions used to calculate the value of pension assets and liabilities, including lower than expected pension fund investment returns and/or increased life expectancy of plan participants, or regulatory change could require us to increase the funding of its defined benefit pension plans or incur higher expenses, which would adversely impact our results of operations and financial position. Certain stockholders may have significant voting influence over matters requiring stockholder approval. As of September 30, 2018, affiliates of Stefano Pessina, our Executive Vice Chairman and Chief Executive Officer (the SP Investors), had sole or shared voting power, directly or indirectly, over an aggregate of approximately 15.3% of our outstanding common stock. The SP Investors have agreed to, for so long as they have the right to designate a nominee for election to the Board, to vote all of their shares of common stock in accordance with the Boards recommendation on matters submitted to a vote of the Companys stockholders (including with respect to the election of directors). The SP Investors significant interest in our common stock potentially could determine the outcome of matters submitted to a vote by our stockholders. The influence of the SP Investors could result in the Company taking actions that other stockholders do not support or failing to take actions that other stockholders support. As a result, the market price of our common stock could be adversely affected. Shares issued to former Alliance Boots stockholders in connection with our strategic combination with Alliance Boots are eligible for future sale. The shares issued to the SP Investors and certain other former Alliance Boots stockholders in connection with our strategic combination with Alliance Boots generally may now be sold pursuant to Rule 144 under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act), subject to restrictions in the case of shares held by persons deemed to be our affiliates and to certain obligations pursuant to a shareholders agreement (as amended, the Company Shareholders Agreement) with certain of the SP Investors. In addition, the Company Shareholders Agreement also contains registration rights that would obligate us, in certain instances, to file future registration statements under the Securities Act covering resales of shares issued to former Alliance Boots stockholders or to permit a piggyback on a future registration statement. A sale, or the perception that a sale may occur, of a substantial number of shares of our common stock could adversely impact the market price of our common stock. Conflicts of interest, or the appearance of conflicts of interest, may arise because certain of our directors and officers are also owners or directors of companies we may have dealings with. Conflicts of interest, or the appearance of conflicts of interest, could arise between our interests and the interests of the other entities and business activities in which our directors or officers are involved. For example, potential conflicts of interest could arise if a dispute were to arise between the Company and other parties to the Company Shareholders Agreement, including the SP Investors. Mr. Pessina, our Executive Vice Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, indirectly controls Alliance Sant Participations S.A. (ASP), a privately-held company which is a party to the Company Shareholders Agreement, and he and his partner Ornella Barra, our Co-Chief Operating Officer, serve as directors of ASP. There are other arrangements between affiliates of Mr. Pessina and the Company, with required disclosures included in the Companys annual proxy statement. Conflicts of interest, or the appearance of conflicts of interest, or similar issues could arise in connection with these or other transactions in the future. While our contractual arrangements place restrictions on the parties conduct in certain situations, and related party transactions are subject to independent review and approval in accordance with our related party transaction approval procedures and applicable law, the potential for a conflict of interest exists and such persons may have conflicts of interest, or the appearance of conflicts of interest, with respect to matters involving or affecting both companies. Our certificate of incorporation and bylaws, Delaware law and/or our agreements with certain stockholders may impede the ability of our stockholders to make changes to our Board or impede a takeover. Certain provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws, as well as provisions of the Delaware General Corporation Law (the DGCL), could make it difficult for stockholders to change the composition of the Board or discourage, delay, or prevent a merger, consolidation, or acquisitions that stockholders may otherwise consider favorable. These provisions include the authorization of the issuance of blank check preferred stock that could be issued by the Board, limitations on the ability of stockholders to call special meetings, and advance notice requirements for nomination for election to the Board or for proposing matters that can be acted upon by stockholders at stockholder meetings. We are also subject to the provisions of Section 203 of the DGCL, which prohibits us, except under specified circumstances, from engaging in any mergers, significant - 25 - sales of stock or assets, or business combinations with any stockholder or group of stockholders who own 15% or more of our common stock. Under the Company Shareholders Agreement, the SP Investors are entitled to designate one nominee to the Board (currently Stefano Pessina) for so long as the SP Investors continue to meet certain beneficial ownership thresholds and subject to certain other conditions. Pursuant to the Company Shareholders Agreement, the SP Investors have agreed that, for so long as they have the right to designate a nominee to the Board, they will vote all of their shares of common stock in accordance with the Boards recommendation on matters submitted to a vote of our stockholders (including with respect to the election of directors). While these provisions do not make us immune from takeovers or changes in the composition of the Board, and are intended to protect our stockholders from, among other things, coercive or otherwise unfair tactics, these provisions could have the effect of making it difficult for stockholders to change the composition of the Board or discouraging, delaying, or preventing a merger, consolidation, or acquisitions that stockholders may otherwise consider favorable. See also the risk factor captioned Certain stockholders may have significant voting influence over matters requiring stockholder approval above. We cannot guarantee that our stock repurchase program will be fully implemented or that it will enhance long-term stockholder value. In June 2018, our Board of Directors approved a new stock repurchase program authorizing the repurchase of up to $10 billion of our common stock. The repurchase program does not have an expiration date and we are not obligated to repurchase a specified number or dollar value of shares, on any particular timetable or at all. There can be no assurance that we will repurchase stock at favorable prices. The repurchase program may be suspended or terminated at any time and, even if fully implemented, may not enhance long-term stockholder value. The market price of our common stock may be volatile. The market price of shares of our common stock may be volatile. Broad general economic, political, market and industry factors may adversely affect the market price of the shares, regardless of our actual operating performance. In addition to the other risk factors identified in this Item 1A, factors that could cause fluctuations in the price of the shares include: ##TABLE_START  actual or anticipated variations in quarterly operating results and the results of competitors; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  changes in financial estimates by us or by any securities analysts that might cover us; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  conditions or trends in the industry, including regulatory changes or changes in the securities marketplace; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  announcements by us or our competitors of significant acquisitions, strategic partnerships or divestitures; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  announcements of investigations or regulatory scrutiny of our operations or lawsuits filed against us; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  additions or departures of key personnel; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  issuances or sales of our common stock, including sales of shares by our directors and officers or key investors, including the SP Investors; and ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  various other market factors or perceived market factors, including rumors or speculation, whether or not correct, involving or affecting us or our industries, vendors, customers, strategic partners or competitors. ##TABLE_END There are a number of additional business risks that could materially and adversely affect our businesses and financial results.

As a result, fiscal 2015 includes the results of Alliance Boots for eight months (January through August 2015) on a fully consolidated basis and four months (September through December 2014) as equity earnings in Alliance Boots reflecting Walgreens pre-merger 45% interest. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START 3  In fiscal 2015, as a result of acquiring the remaining 55% interest in Alliance Boots, the Companys previously held 45% interest was remeasured to fair value, resulting in a gain of $563 million. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START 4  Fiscal 2018 includes the gain on sale of the Companys equity interest in Premise Health, partially offset by the impairment of the Companys equity method investment in Guangzhou Pharmaceuticals Corporation.

Managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations The following discussion and analysis of the Companys financial condition and results of operations should be read together with the financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere herein and the description of the Companys business and reportable segments in item 1 above. This discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results may differ materially from those discussed in forward-looking statements. Factors that might cause a difference include, but are not limited to, those discussed under cautionary note regarding forward-looking statements below and in risk factors in part I, item 1A of this Form 10-K. References herein to the Company, we, us, or our refer to Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. and its subsidiaries from and after the effective time of the Reorganization on December 31, 2014 and, prior to that time, to its predecessor Walgreen Co. and its subsidiaries, and in each case do not include unconsolidated partially-owned entities, except as otherwise indicated or the context otherwise requires. INTRODUCTION Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. (Walgreens Boots Alliance) and its subsidiaries are a global pharmacy-led health and wellbeing enterprise. Its operations are conducted through three reportable segments: ##TABLE_START  Retail Pharmacy USA; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Retail Pharmacy International; and ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Pharmaceutical Wholesale ##TABLE_END See note 16 , segment reporting , for further information. Acquisition of certain Rite Aid Corporation (  Rite Aid  ) assets On September 19, 2017, the Company announced that it had secured regulatory clearance for an amended and restated asset purchase agreement to purchase 1,932 stores, three distribution centers and related inventory from Rite Aid for $4.375 billion in cash and other consideration. The Company has completed the acquisition of all 1,932 Rite Aid stores. The transition of the first distribution center and related inventory occurred in September 2018 and the transition of the remaining two distribution centers and related inventory remains subject to closing conditions set forth in the amended and restated asset purchase agreement. The Company continues to expect to complete integration of the acquired stores and related assets by the end of fiscal 2020, at an estimated total cost of approximately $750 million, which is reported as acquisition-related costs. During fiscal 2018, the Company recognized pre-tax charges to its financial results of $ 221 million related to integration of the acquired stores and related assets. In addition, the Company continues to expect to spend approximately $500 million of capital on store conversions and related activities. The Company expects annual synergies from the transaction of more than $325 million, compared to the Companys previously stated expectation of $300 million, which are expected to be fully realized within four years of the initial closing of this transaction and derived primarily from procurement, cost savings and other operational matters. The amounts and timing of all estimates are subject to change until finalized. The actual amounts and timing may vary materially based on various factors. See cautionary note regarding forward-looking statements below. Comparability The influence of certain holidays, seasonality, foreign currency rates, changes in vendor, payer and customer relationships and terms, strategic transactions including acquisitions, for example the acquisition of stores and other assets from Rite Aid, joint ventures and other strategic collaborations, changes in laws, for example the U.S. tax law changes, the timing and magnitude of cost reduction initiatives, and general economic conditions in the markets in which the Company operates and other factors on the Companys operations and net earnings for any period may not be comparable to the same period in previous years and are not necessarily indicative of future operating results. RECENT DEVELOPMENTS Premise Health On June 28, 2018, Premise Health Holding Corp. and OMERS, a Canadian pension fund, announced that an affiliate of OMERS would acquire control of Premise Health, an entity in which the Company indirectly held a minority equity interest. In July 2018, the Company completed the sale of its minority equity interest in Premise Health, resulting in an after-tax gain on disposition of $ 245 million . The Company treated this transaction as a special item, which is reported as a gain on sale of equity method investment impacting comparability of results in its earnings disclosures for fiscal 2018 . Investment in Chinese Pharmacy Chain GuoDa - 34 - On December 6, 2017 the Company announced that it had reached an agreement with China National Accord Medicines Corporation Ltd. to become an investor in its subsidiary Sinopharm Holding Guoda Drugstores Co., Ltd. (GuoDa), a leading retail pharmacy chain in China. Following a public tender process, the Companys bid met all the requirements set by the seller to acquire a 40 percent equity interest in GuoDa for approximately $416 million . On July 5, 2018, the Company acquired its 40 percent equity interest and began to account for this investment using the equity method of accounting. See note 5 , equity method investments , to the Consolidated Financial Statements included herein for further information. U.S. tax law changes The United States government enacted comprehensive tax legislation in December 2017. The U.S. tax law changes include broad and complex changes affecting the Company's fiscal 2018 and future results. Among other things, the U.S. tax law changes reduced the federal corporate tax rate from 35% to 21% effective January 1, 2018 and require companies to immediately accrue for a one-time transition tax on certain un-repatriated earnings of foreign subsidiaries, which is payable over an eight year period. The U.S. tax law changes modify the taxation of foreign earnings, repeal the deduction for domestic production activities, limit interest deductibility and establish a global intangible low tax income (GILTI) regime. In connection with the Companys ongoing analysis of the impact of the U.S. tax law changes, which is provisional and subject to change, the Company recorded a net tax benefit of $125 million during fiscal 2018 . This provisional net tax benefit arises from a benefit of $648 million from re-measuring the Companys net U.S. deferred tax liabilities, partly offset by the Companys accrual for the transition tax and other U.S. tax law changes of $523 million . As of August 31, 2018 , while the Company made reasonable estimates of the impact of the U.S. tax law changes, the final impact may differ from these estimates, due to, among other things, changes in its interpretations and assumptions, technical clarifications from the U.S. Department of the Treasury and IRS and actions the Company may take. In addition, the Companys results for fiscal 2018 also include a net reduction to the effective tax rate for the current year as a result of the U.S. tax law changes. The lower corporate income tax rate of 21% became effective January 1, 2018, resulting in a U.S. statutory federal tax rate of approximately 26% for fiscal 2018 and 21% for subsequent fiscal years, which provided a benefit to the fiscal 2018 tax provision of approximately $307 million . EXIT AND DISPOSAL ACTIVITIES Store Optimization Program On October 24, 2017, the Companys Board of Directors approved a plan to implement a program (the Store Optimization Program) to optimize store locations through the planned closure of approximately 600 stores and related assets within the Companys Retail Pharmacy USA segment upon completion of the acquisition of certain stores and related assets from Rite Aid. The actions under the Store Optimization Program commenced in March 2018 and are expected to take place over an 18 month period. The Store Optimization Program is expected to result in cost savings of approximately $325 million per year, compared to the Companys previously stated expectation of $300 million, to be fully delivered by the end of fiscal 2020. The Company currently estimates that it will recognize cumulative pre-tax charges to its GAAP financial results of approximately $450 million, including costs associated with lease obligations and other real estate costs, employee severance and other exit costs. The Company expects to incur pre-tax charges of approximately $270 million for lease obligations and other real estate costs and approximately $180 million for employee severance and other exit costs. The Company estimates that substantially all of these cumulative pre-tax charges will result in cash expenditures. The Company has recognized cumulative pre-tax charges to its financial results in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America (\"GAAP\") of $100 million , which were recorded within selling, general and administrative expenses. These charges included $19 million related to lease obligations and other real estate costs and $81 million in employee severance and other exit costs. Store Optimization Program charges are recognized as the costs are incurred over time in accordance with GAAP. The Company treats charges related to the Store Optimization Program as special items impacting comparability of results in its earnings disclosures. The amounts and timing of all estimates are subject to change until finalized. The actual amounts and timing may vary materially based on various factors. See cautionary note regarding forward-looking statements below. Cost Transformation Program - 35 - On April 8, 2015, the Walgreens Boots Alliance Board of Directors approved a plan to implement a restructuring program (the Cost Transformation Program) as part of an initiative to reduce costs and increase operating efficiencies. The Cost Transformation Program implemented and built on the planned three-year, $1.0 billion cost-reduction initiative previously announced by Walgreens on August 6, 2014 and included a number of elements designed to help achieve profitable growth through increased cost efficiencies. In April 2015, the Company announced that it had identified additional opportunities for cost savings that increased the total expected cost savings of the Cost Transformation Program by $500 million to a targeted $1.5 billion by the end of fiscal 2017, with significant areas of focus including plans to close approximately 200 stores across the U.S.; reorganize divisional and field operations; drive operating efficiencies; and streamline information technology and other functions. The actions under the Cost Transformation Program focused primarily on the Companys Retail Pharmacy USA segment. The Company achieved the targeted $1.5 billion in savings from the Cost Transformation Program ahead of schedule. As announced in the second quarter of fiscal 2017, the Company closed a total of approximately 260 stores. The Company completed the Cost Transformation Program in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017, and over the duration of the program, 255 stores were closed. Full program benefits will be recognized in subsequent periods. The Company recognized cumulative pre-tax charges to its fiscal 2017 financial results in accordance with GAAP of $1.8 billion. These charges included $743 million for asset impairment charges relating primarily to asset write-offs from store closures, information technology, inventory and other non-operational real estate asset write-offs; $665 million for real estate costs, including lease obligations (net of estimated sublease income); and $393 million for employee severance and other business transition and exit costs. The Company estimates that approximately 60% of the cumulative pre-tax charges will result in cash expenditures over time, primarily related to historical and future lease and other real estate payments and employee separation costs. See note 3 , exit and disposal activities , to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. AMERISOURCEBERGEN CORPORATION RELATIONSHIP In March 2013, Walgreens, Alliance Boots and AmerisourceBergen announced various agreements and arrangements, including a ten-year pharmaceutical distribution agreement between Walgreens and AmerisourceBergen pursuant to which branded and generic pharmaceutical products are sourced from AmerisourceBergen in the United States and an agreement which provides AmerisourceBergen the ability to access generics pharmaceutical products through WBAD. In May 2016, certain of these agreements were extended for three years to now expire in 2026.  In addition, in March 2013, Walgreens, Alliance Boots and AmerisourceBergen entered into agreements and arrangements pursuant to which the Company has the right, but not the obligation, to purchase a minority equity position in AmerisourceBergen over time through open market purchases and pursuant to warrants to acquire AmerisourceBergen common stock and gain associated representation on AmerisourceBergens Board of Directors in certain circumstances. Please refer to the Companys Form 8-K filed on March 20, 2013 for more detailed information regarding these agreements and arrangements. On March 18, 2016, the Company exercised warrants to purchase 22,696,912 shares of AmerisourceBergen common stock at an exercise price of $51.50 per share for an aggregate exercise price payment of $1.17 billion. On August 25, 2016, the Company exercised additional warrants to purchase 22,696,912 shares of AmerisourceBergen common stock at an exercise price of $52.50 per share for an aggregate exercise price payment of $1.19 billion. As of August 31, 2018 , the Company owned 56,854,867 AmerisourceBergen common shares representing approximately 26% of the outstanding AmerisourceBergen common stock and had designated one member of AmerisourceBergens board of directors. As of August 31, 2018 , the Company can acquire up to an additional 8,398,752 AmerisourceBergen shares in the open market and thereafter designate another member of AmerisourceBergens board of directors, subject in each case to applicable legal and contractual requirements. The amount of permitted open market purchases is subject to increase or decrease in certain circumstances. Effective March 18, 2016, the Company began accounting for its investment in AmerisourceBergen using the equity method of accounting, subject to a two-month reporting lag, with the net earnings attributable to the investment being classified within the operating income of the Companys Pharmaceutical Wholesale segment. See note 5 , equity method investments , to the Consolidated Financial Statements included herein for further information. Due to the March 18, 2016 effective date and the two-month reporting lag, the Companys results for the 12 month period ended August 31, 2016 include approximately three and a half months of equity method income relating to its investment in AmerisourceBergen. Similarly, results for the 12 month period ended August 31, 2017 include approximately ten and a half months of equity income reflecting the Companys increased ownership following the exercise on August 25, 2016 of the second tranche of warrants.

The increase s primarily reflect the Companys Cost Transformation Program in prior year, operating performance and the gain on sale of the Companys equity interest in Premise Health, partially offset by certain legal and regulatory accruals and an impairment of the Companys equity method investment in Guangzhou Pharmaceuticals Corporation. Diluted net earnings per share was also positively affected by a lower number of shares outstanding compared with the prior year. Other income for fiscal 2018 was $177 million compared to an expense of $11 million for fiscal 2017 . Other income for fiscal 2018 includes the gain on sale of the Companys equity interest Premise Health, partially offset by the impairment of the Companys equity method investment in Guangzhou Pharmaceuticals Corporation.  Interest was a net expense of $616 million and $693 million in fiscal 2018 and 2017 , respectively. - 37 - The effective tax rate for fiscal 2018 and 2017 was 16.7% and 15.7% , respectively. The net increase in the effective tax rate was primarily attributable to changes in the geographic mix of pre-tax earnings, partly offset by a provisional net tax benefit of $125 million as a result of U.S. tax law changes enacted in December 2017. In addition, the Companys results for fiscal 2018 also include a net reduction to the effective tax rate for the current year as a result of the U.S. tax law changes. Adjusted diluted net earnings per share (Non-GAAP measure) fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017  Adjusted net earnings attributable to Walgreens Boots Alliance in fiscal 2018  increase d 8.8 percent to $6.0 billion compared with the prior year. Adjusted diluted net earnings per share in fiscal 2018  increase d 18.0 percent to $6.02 compared with the prior year. Adjusted net earnings and adjusted diluted earnings per share were positively impacted by 0.8 percentage points and 0.9 percentage points, respectively, as a result of currency translation. Excluding the impact of currency translation, the increase in adjusted net earnings and adjusted diluted net earnings per share for fiscal 2018 primarily reflect the impact of U.S. tax law changes and increased adjusted operating income. Adjusted diluted net earnings per share was also positively affected by a lower number of shares outstanding compared with the prior year. See --Non-GAAP Measures below for a reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP measure. Fiscal 2017 compared to fiscal 2016  Fiscal 2017 net earnings attributable to Walgreens Boots Alliance decreased 2.3 percent to $4.1 billion, while diluted net earnings per share decreased 1.0 percent to $3.78 compared with the prior year. The decreases reflect Rite Aid related costs, the phasing of the Companys Cost Transformation Program and the impact in the prior year of the change in accounting method for the Companys investment in AmerisourceBergen, largely offset by the reduction in the fair value of the Companys AmerisourceBergen warrants, improvements in selling, general and administration expenses before cost transformation expenses and a lower effective tax rate. Other expense for fiscal 2017 and fiscal 2016 was $11 million and $261 million, respectively. In fiscal 2016, the change in fair value of the Companys AmerisourceBergen warrants resulted in a loss of $517 million, and additionally, the Company recognized income of $268 million related to the change in accounting method for its investment in AmerisourceBergen. Interest was a net expense of $693 million and $596 million in fiscal 2017 and 2016, respectively. The increase mainly reflects the prefunded acquisition financing costs relating to the Rite Aid transaction. The effective tax rate for fiscal 2017 and 2016 was 15.7% and 19.4%, respectively. The net decrease in the effective tax rate was primarily attributable to changes in the geographic mix of pre-tax earnings, favorable changes in permanent differences between the Companys financial statement earnings and taxable profits as well as incremental discrete tax benefits. The mix of pre-tax earnings was notably impacted by the Cost Transformation Program and costs associated with the termination of the Rite Aid Merger Agreement, both of which reduced the Companys U.S. pre-tax earnings. For fiscal 2017, net discrete tax benefits resulted primarily from deferred tax benefits related to a change in the U.K. tax rate, adopting ASU 2016-09 and net tax benefits associated with prior tax years. Adjusted diluted net earnings per share (Non-GAAP measure) fiscal 2017 compared to fiscal 2016  Adjusted net earnings attributable to Walgreens Boots Alliance in fiscal 2017 increased 9.9 percent to $5.5 billion compared with the prior year. Adjusted diluted net earnings per share in fiscal 2017 increased 11.1 percent to $5.10 compared with the prior year. Adjusted net earnings and adjusted diluted earnings per share were negatively impacted by 1.7 percentage points and 1.8 percentage points, respectively, as a result of currency translation. Excluding the impact of currency translation, the increase in adjusted net earnings and adjusted diluted net earnings per share for fiscal 2017 was primarily due to an increase in equity earnings from AmerisourceBergen and a lower effective tax rate.

This adjustment reflects the fact that these prescriptions include approximately three times the amount of product days supplied compared to a normal prescription. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START 4  Comparable stores are defined as those that have been open for at least twelve consecutive months without closure for seven or more consecutive days and without a major remodel or subject to a natural disaster in the past twelve months. Relocated and acquired stores are not included as comparable stores for the first twelve months after the relocation or acquisition. The method of calculating comparable sales varies across the retail industry. As a result, the Companys method of calculating comparable sales may not be the same as other retailers methods. The fiscal year ended August 31, 2016 figures include an adjustment to remove February 29, 2016 results due to the leap year. ##TABLE_END Sales fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017  The Retail Pharmacy USA divisions sales for fiscal 2018  increase d by 12.7% to $98.4 billion . Sales in comparable stores were up 1.5% in fiscal 2018 . The Company operated 9,569 locations ( 9,560  retail stores ) as of August 31,  2018 , compared to 8,109 locations ( 8,100  retail stores ) a year earlier. Pharmacy sales increase d by 17.2% in fiscal 2018 and represented 72.2% of the divisions sales. The increase in fiscal 2018 is due to higher prescription volumes, including central specialty and mail following the formation of AllianceRx Walgreens - 39 - Prime and from the acquisition of Rite Aid stores. This increase was partially offset by reimbursement pressure and the impact of generics. In fiscal 2017 , pharmacy sales increased 7.3% and represented 69.4% of the divisions sales. Comparable pharmacy sales increase d 3.4% in fiscal 2018 compared to an increase of 4.7% in fiscal 2017 . The effect of generic drugs, which have a lower retail price, replacing brand name drugs reduced prescription sales by 1.4% in fiscal 2018 compared to a reduction of 2.4% in fiscal 2017 . The effect of generics on division sales was a reduction of 0.9% in fiscal 2018 compared to a reduction of 1.5% for fiscal 2017 . Third-party sales, where reimbursement is received from managed care organizations, governmental agencies, employers or private insurers, were 98.3% of prescription sales for fiscal 2018 compared to 97.7% for fiscal 2017 . The total number of prescriptions (including immunizations) filled in fiscal 2018 was 823.1 million compared to 764.4 million in fiscal 2017 . Prescriptions (including immunizations) adjusted to 30-day equivalents were 1,094.4 million in fiscal 2018 compared to 989.7 million in fiscal 2017 . The increase in prescription volume was primarily driven by the acquisition of Rite Aid stores and from strategic pharmacy partnerships.

Comparable retail sales decrease d 2.4% in fiscal 2018 compared to a decrease of 1.0% in fiscal 2017 . The decrease in comparable retail sales in fiscal 2018 was primarily due to declines in the consumables and general merchandise category and in the personal care category, which were partially offset by growth in the health and wellness category and in the beauty category.  Operating income fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017  Retail Pharmacy USA divisions operating income for fiscal 2018  increase d 16.7% to $4.9 billion . The increase was primarily due to reduction in selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales and higher sales, partially offset by lower gross margin. Gross margin was 24.1% in fiscal 2018 compared to 25.7% in fiscal 2017 . Pharmacy margins were negatively impacted in the current fiscal year by a higher mix of specialty sales and by lower third-party reimbursements. The decrease in pharmacy margins was partially offset by the favorable impact of procurement efficiencies. Retail margins were positively impacted in the current fiscal year primarily due to underlying margin improvement from changes in promotional plans. Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales were 19.2% in fiscal 2018 compared to 20.9% in fiscal 2017 . As a percentage of sales, expenses were lower primarily due to sales mix in the current period and costs from the Cost Transformation Program in the year ago period, partially offset by certain legal and regulatory accruals in the current period.  Adjusted operating income (Non-GAAP measure) fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017  Retail Pharmacy USA divisions adjusted operating income for fiscal 2018  increase d 3.8% to $5.9 billion . The increase was primarily due to a reduction in selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales and higher sales, partially offset by lower gross margin.

Sales fiscal 2017 compared to fiscal 2016  The Retail Pharmacy USA divisions sales for fiscal 2017 increased by 4.2% to $87.3 billion. Sales increased primarily due to higher comparable store sales, which were up 2.8% in fiscal 2017 driven by growth in Medicare Part D prescriptions and strategic partnerships. Sales were also higher due to the inclusion of five months of results for AllianceRx Walgreens Prime, the Companys recently formed central specialty and mail services business. The Company operated 8,109 locations (8,100  retail stores ) as of August 31, 2017, compared to 8,184 locations (8,175  retail stores ) a year earlier. Pharmacy sales increased by 7.3% in fiscal 2017 and represented 69.4% of the divisions sales. The increase in fiscal 2017 is due to higher prescription volumes, including central specialty and mail following the formation of AllianceRx Walgreens Prime in March 2017. This increase was partially offset by the impact of generics and reimbursement pressure. In fiscal 2016, pharmacy sales increased 5.5% and represented 67.4% of the divisions sales. Comparable pharmacy sales increased 4.7% in fiscal 2017 compared to an increase of 6.0% in fiscal 2016. The effect of generic drugs, which have a lower retail price, replacing brand name drugs reduced prescription sales by 2.4% in fiscal 2017 compared to a reduction of 1.9% in fiscal 2016. The effect of generics on division sales was a reduction of 1.5% in fiscal 2017 compared to a reduction of 1.1% for fiscal 2016.

The total number of prescriptions (including immunizations) filled in fiscal 2017 was 764.4 million compared to 740.1 million in fiscal 2016. Prescriptions (including immunizations) adjusted to 30-day equivalents were 989.7 million in fiscal 2017 compared to 928.5 million in fiscal 2016. The increase in prescription volume was primarily driven by Medicare Part D growth and the impact of strategic partnerships. - 40 - Retail sales decreased 2.4% in fiscal 2017 and were 30.6% of the divisions sales. In comparison, fiscal 2016 retail sales decreased 0.3% and comprised 32.6% of the divisions sales. Comparable retail sales decreased 1.0% in fiscal 2017 compared to a decrease of 0.3% in fiscal 2016. The decrease in comparable retail sales growth in fiscal 2017 was primarily due to declines in the consumables and general merchandise category and in the personal care category, which were partially offset by growth in the health and wellness category and in the beauty category. Operating income fiscal 2017 compared to fiscal 2016  Retail Pharmacy USA divisions operating income for fiscal 2017 decreased 4.8% to $4.2 billion. The decrease was primarily due to higher selling, general and administrative expenses related to the Rite Aid transaction and the Cost Transformation Program, partially offset by an increase in gross profit. Gross margin was 25.7% in fiscal 2017 compared to 26.6% in fiscal 2016. Pharmacy margins were negatively impacted in the current fiscal year by lower third-party reimbursements and a higher mix of specialty sales.

Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales were 20.9% in fiscal 2017 compared to 21.4% in fiscal 2016. As a percentage of sales, expenses in the current fiscal year were lower primarily due to higher sales, sales mix and increased efficiencies from the Cost Transformation Program. Adjusted operating income (Non-GAAP measure) fiscal 2017 compared to fiscal 2016  Retail Pharmacy USA divisions adjusted operating income for fiscal 2017 increased 6.5% to $5.7 billion.

Short-term investment objectives are primarily to minimize risk and maintain liquidity. To attain these objectives, investment limits are placed on the amount, type and issuer of securities. Investments are principally in U.S. Treasury money market funds and AAA-rated money market funds. The Companys long-term capital policy is to maintain a strong balance sheet and financial flexibility, reinvest in its core strategies, invest in strategic opportunities that reinforce those core strategies and meet return requirements and return surplus cash flow to stockholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases over the long term. In June 2018, the Companys Board of Directors reviewed and refined the Companys dividend policy to set forth the Companys current intention to increase its dividend each year. Cash provided by operations and the issuance of debt are the principal sources of funds for expansion, investments, acquisitions, remodeling programs, dividends to stockholders and stock repurchases. Net cash provided by operating activities was $8.3 billion in fiscal 2018 compared to $7.3 billion in fiscal 2017 and $7.8 billion in fiscal 2016 . The $1.0 billion  increase in cash provided by operating activities includes lower income taxes paid and lower cash outflows from accrued expenses and other liabilities, partially offset by higher cash outflows from trade accounts payable and other non-current liabilities. Changes in income taxes paid are mainly due to the impact of the U.S. tax law changes. Changes in accrued expenses and other liabilities, trade accounts payable and other non-current liabilities are mainly driven by the timing of accruals and payments including cash inflows post acquisition of Rite Aid assets in fiscal 2018 and cash inflows from term changes on pharmaceutical related purchases in fiscal 2017 . Net cash used for investing activities was $5.5 billion in fiscal 2018 compared to $0.8 billion in fiscal 2017 and $3.5 billion in fiscal 2016 . Business, investment and asset acquisitions in fiscal 2018 were $4.8 billion compared to $0.1 billion for the year-ago period. Business, investment and asset acquisitions in fiscal 2018 include the acquisition of Rite Aid assets and the investment in GuoDa. Fiscal 2016 included the acquisition of an international beauty brand and prescription files, as well as an investment in AmerisourceBergen of $2.4 billion as a result of the exercise of warrants. Additions to property, plant and equipment in fiscal 2018 were $1.4 billion compared to $1.4 billion in fiscal 2017 and $1.3 billion in fiscal 2016 . Capital expenditures by reporting segment were as follows: ##TABLE_START     Retail Pharmacy USA  $ 1,022  $  $ Retail Pharmacy International    Pharmaceutical Wholesale    Total  $ 1,367 $ 1,351 $ 1,325 ##TABLE_END- 49 - Additionally, investing activities for fiscal 2018 did not include any proceeds related to sale leaseback transactions, compared to $444 million in the comparable prior year period. Net cash used for financing activities in fiscal 2018 was $5.3 billion compared to net cash used for financing activities of $12.9 billion in fiscal 2017 and net cash provided by financing activities of $2.6 billion in fiscal 2016 . The Company repurchased shares as part of the stock repurchase programs described below and to support the needs of the employee stock plans totaling $5.2 billion in fiscal 2018 compared to $5.2 billion in fiscal 2017 and $1.2 billion in fiscal 2016 . Proceeds related to employee stock plans were $174 million in fiscal 2018 compared to $217 million in fiscal 2017 and $235 million in fiscal 2016 . Cash dividends paid were $1.7 billion in fiscal 2018 compared to $1.7 billion and $1.6 billion in fiscal 2017 and fiscal 2016 , respectively. In fiscal 2018 there were $5.9 billion in proceeds primarily from revolving facilities described below and commercial paper debt compared to no proceeds in 2017 and $6.0 billion in proceeds received from U.S. dollar denominated debt offerings in fiscal 2016 (a portion of which was redeemed in fiscal 2017 under the special mandatory redemption terms of the indenture governing such notes, as described below). The Company believes that cash flow from operations, availability under existing credit facilities and arrangements, current cash and investment balances and the ability to obtain other financing, if necessary, will provide adequate cash funds for the Companys foreseeable working capital needs, capital expenditures at existing facilities, pending acquisitions, dividend payments and debt service obligations for at least the next 12 months. The Companys cash requirements are subject to change as business conditions warrant and opportunities arise. The timing and size of any new business ventures or acquisitions that the Company may complete may also impact its cash requirements. See item 7A, qualitative and quantitative disclosures about market risk, below for a discussion of certain financing and market risks. Stock repurchase programs In April 2017, Walgreens Boots Alliance authorized a stock repurchase program (the April 2017 stock repurchase program), which authorized the repurchase of up to $1.0 billion of Walgreens Boots Alliance common stock prior to the programs expiration on December 31, 2017. In May 2017, the Company completed the April 2017 stock repurchase program, purchasing 11.8 million shares. In June 2017, Walgreens Boots Alliance authorized a new stock repurchase program, which authorized the repurchase of up to $5.0 billion of Walgreens Boots Alliance common stock prior to the programs expiration on August 31, 2018, which authorization was increased by an additional $1.0 billion in October 2017 (as expanded, the June 2017 stock repurchase program). In October 2017, the Company completed the June 2017 stock repurchase program, purchasing 77.4 million shares. In June 2018, Walgreens Boots Alliance authorized a new stock repurchase program (the June 2018 stock repurchase program), which authorized the repurchase of up to $10.0 billion of Walgreens Boots Alliance common stock of which the Company had repurchased $2.7 billion as of August 31, 2018 . The June 2018 stock repurchase program has no specified expiration date. The Company purchased 72 million and 59 million shares under stock repurchase programs in fiscal 2018 and 2017 at a cost of $4.9 billion and $4.8 billion , respectively. The Company determines the timing and amount of repurchases, including repurchases to offset anticipated dilution from equity incentive plans, based on its assessment of various factors, including prevailing market conditions, alternate uses of capital, liquidity and the economic environment. The Company has repurchased, and may from time to time in the future repurchase, shares on the open market through Rule 10b5-1 plans, which enable the Company to repurchase shares at times when it otherwise might be precluded from doing so under insider trading laws.  Commercial paper The Company periodically borrows under its commercial paper program and may continue to borrow under it in future periods. The Company had $430 million commercial paper borrowings outstanding as of August 31, 2018 and there were no commercial paper borrowings outstanding as of August 31, 2017 . The Company had average daily short-term borrowings of $1.4 billion of commercial paper outstanding at a weighted average interest rate of 2.11% for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2018 and no activity under its commercial paper program for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2017 . Financing actions On November 10, 2014, Walgreens Boots Alliance and Walgreens entered into a term loan credit agreement with the lenders party thereto (the 2014 Term Loan Agreement), which provided Walgreens Boots Alliance and Walgreens with the ability to borrow up to 1.45 billion on an unsecured basis. On August 30, 2017, Walgreens Boots Alliance used available cash to repay in full all outstanding loans and obligations under the 2014 Term Loan Agreement, which, as of such date, consisted of the remaining unamortized amount of 1.41 billion ($1.83 billion at the August 31, 2017 spot rate of $1.295 to 1) aggregate principal amount of outstanding loans together with accrued interest thereon through, but excluding, the payment date, and the 2014 Term Loan Agreement terminated in accordance with its terms. - 50 -  On November 10, 2014, Walgreens Boots Alliance and Walgreens entered into a five-year unsecured, multicurrency revolving credit agreement with the lenders party thereto (the 2014 Revolving Credit Agreement), which had available credit of $3.0 billion, of which $500 million was available for the issuance of letters of credit. The 2014 Revolving Credit Agreement was terminated in accordance with its terms and conditions as of August 29, 2018, and as of that date, there were no borrowings outstanding. The 2014 Revolving Credit Facility was terminated concurrently with the execution of the 2018 Revolving Credit Agreement described below. On November 18, 2014, Walgreens Boots Alliance issued several series of unsecured, unsubordinated notes totaling $8.0 billion, with maturities ranging from 2016 to 2044. All such notes have fixed interest rates, with the exception of the $750 million floating rate notes due 2016, which were repaid in full in May 2016 and which had a floating rate based on the three month LIBOR plus a fixed spread of 45 basis points. On August 28, 2017, Walgreens Boots Alliance redeemed in full its $750 million 1.750% notes due 2017 at a make-whole redemption price. On June 1, 2016, Walgreens Boots Alliance issued in an underwritten public offering $1.2 billion of 1.750% notes due 2018 (the 2018 notes), $1.5 billion of 2.600% notes due 2021 (the 2021 notes), $0.8 billion of 3.100% notes due 2023 (the 2023 notes), $1.9 billion of 3.450% notes due 2026 (the 2026 notes) and $0.6 billion of 4.650% notes due 2046 (the 2046 notes). Because the merger with Rite Aid was not consummated on or prior to June 1, 2017, the 2018 notes, the 2021 notes and the 2023 notes were redeemed on June 5, 2017 under the special mandatory redemption terms of the indenture governing such notes. The 2026 notes and 2046 notes remain outstanding in accordance with their respective terms. On February 1, 2017, Walgreens Boots Alliance entered into a $1.0 billion revolving credit facility (as amended, the February 2017 Revolving Credit Agreement) with the lenders from time to time party thereto and, on August 1, 2017, Walgreens Boots Alliance entered into an amendment agreement thereto. The terms and conditions of the February 2017 Revolving Credit Agreement were unchanged by the amendment other than the extension of the facility termination date to the earlier of (a) January 31, 2019 and (b) the date of termination in whole of the aggregate commitments provided by the lenders thereunder. Borrowings under the February 2017 Revolving Credit Agreement will bear interest at a fluctuating rate per annum equal to, at Walgreens Boots Alliances option, the alternate base rate or the reserve adjusted Eurocurrency rate, in each case, plus an applicable margin calculated based on Walgreens Boots Alliances credit ratings. As of August 31, 2018 , there were no borrowings under the February 2017 Revolving Credit Agreement. On August 24, 2017, Walgreens Boots Alliance entered into a $1.0 billion revolving credit agreement with the lenders from time to time party thereto (the August 2017 Revolving Credit Agreement) and a $1.0 billion term loan credit agreement with Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation (the 2017 Term Loan Credit Agreement and together with the August 2017 Revolving Credit Agreement, the August 2017 Credit Agreements). The August 2017 Revolving Credit Agreement is an unsecured revolving credit facility with a facility termination date of the earlier of (a) January 31, 2019, subject to any extension thereof pursuant to the terms of the August 2017 Revolving Credit Agreement and (b) the date of termination in whole of the aggregate commitments provided by the lenders thereunder. As of August 31, 2018 , there were no borrowings outstanding under the August 2017 Revolving Credit Agreement. The 2017 Term Loan Credit Agreement is an unsecured multi-draw term loan facility maturing on March 30, 2019. As of August 31, 2018 , Walgreens Boots Alliance had $1.0 billion of borrowings outstanding under the 2017 Term Loan Credit Agreement and no additional commitments were available. Borrowings under the August 2017 Credit Agreements will bear interest at a fluctuating rate per annum equal to, at Walgreens Boots Alliances option, the alternate base rate or the Eurocurrency rate, in each case, plus an applicable margin calculated based on Walgreens Boots Alliances credit ratings. On August 29, 2018, Walgreens Boots Alliance entered into a revolving credit agreement (the 2018 Revolving Credit Agreement) with the lenders and letter of credit issuers from time to time party thereto. The 2018 Revolving Credit Agreement is an unsecured revolving credit facility with an aggregate commitment in the amount of $3.5 billion, with a letter of credit subfacility commitment amount of $500 million. The facility termination date is the earlier of (a) August 29, 2023, subject to the extension thereof pursuant to the 2018 Revolving Credit Agreement and (b) the date of termination in whole of the aggregate amount of the revolving commitments pursuant to the 2018 Revolving Credit Agreement. Borrowings under the 2018 Revolving Credit Agreement will bear interest at a fluctuating rate per annum equal to, at Walgreens Boots Alliances option, the alternate base rate or the Eurocurrency rate, in each case, plus an applicable margin calculated based on Walgreens Boots Alliances credit ratings. From time to time, the Company may also enter into other credit facilities, including in March 2018, a $350 million short-term unsecured revolving credit facility which was undrawn as of August 31, 2018 and which was terminated in accordance with its terms and conditions in September 2018. - 51 - Debt covenants Each of the Companys credit facilities described above contain a covenant to maintain, as of the last day of each fiscal quarter, a ratio of consolidated debt to total capitalization not to exceed 0.60:1.00. The credit facilities contain various other customary covenants. As of August 31, 2018 , the Company was in compliance with all such applicable covenants. Credit ratings As of October 10, 2018, the credit ratings of Walgreens Boots Alliance were:  ##TABLE_START Rating Agency Long-Term Debt Rating Commercial Paper Rating Outlook Fitch BBB F2 Stable Moodys Baa2 P-2 Stable Standard  Poors BBB A-2 Stable ##TABLE_ENDIn assessing the Companys credit strength, each rating agency considers various factors including the Companys business model, capital structure, financial policies and financial performance. There can be no assurance that any particular rating will be assigned or maintained. The Companys credit ratings impact its borrowing costs, access to capital markets and operating lease costs. The rating agency ratings are not recommendations to buy, sell or hold the Companys debt securities or commercial paper. Each rating may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating agency and should be evaluated independently of any other rating. AmerisourceBergen relationship Pursuant to arrangements with AmerisourceBergen, the Company has the right, but not the obligation, to purchase a minority equity position in AmerisourceBergen over time as described under --AmerisourceBergen Corporation relationship above. Subject to applicable legal and contractual requirements, share purchases may be made from time to time in open market transactions or pursuant to instruments and plans complying with Rule 10b5-1.  See note 5 , equity method investments , to the Consolidated Financial Statements included herein for further information. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES The information set forth in note 10 , commitments and contingencies , to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in part II, item 8 of this Form 10-K is incorporated herein by reference. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES The Consolidated Financial Statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America and include amounts based on managements prudent judgments and estimates. Actual results may differ from these estimates. Management believes that any reasonable deviation from those judgments and estimates would not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations. To the extent that the estimates used differ from actual results, however, adjustments to the Consolidated Statements of Earnings and corresponding Consolidated Balance Sheets accounts would be necessary. These adjustments would be made in future periods. Some of the more significant estimates include business combinations, goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment, cost of sales and inventory, equity method investments, pension and postretirement benefits and income taxes. We use the following methods to determine our estimates:  Business combinations   We account for business combinations using the acquisition method of accounting, which requires that once control is obtained, all the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, including amounts attributable to noncontrolling interests, be recorded at their respective fair values at the date of acquisition. The determination of fair values of assets and liabilities acquired requires estimates and the use of valuation techniques when market value is not readily available. For intangible assets, we generally use the income approach to determine fair value. The income approach requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions. These estimates and assumptions primarily include, but are not limited to: discount rates, terminal growth rates, royalty rates, forecasts of revenue, operating income, depreciation, amortization and capital expenditures. The discount rates applied to the projections reflect the risk factors associated with those projections. Although we believe our estimates of fair value are reasonable, actual financial results could differ from those estimates due to the inherent uncertainty involved in making such estimates. Changes in assumptions concerning future financial results or other underlying assumptions could have a significant impact on the determination of the fair value of the intangible assets acquired. - 52 - Judgment is also required in determining the intangible assets useful life. Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment  Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are evaluated for impairment annually during the fourth quarter, or more frequently if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit or intangible asset below its carrying value. As part of our impairment analysis for each reporting unit, we determine fair value for each reporting unit. This determination includes estimating the fair value using both the income and market approaches. The income approach requires management to estimate a number of factors for each reporting unit, including projected future operating results, economic projections, anticipated future cash flows and discount rates. The market approach estimates fair value using comparable marketplace fair value data from within a comparable industry grouping. The determination of the fair value of the reporting units requires us to make significant estimates and assumptions. These estimates and assumptions primarily include, but are not limited to: the selection of appropriate peer group companies, control premiums appropriate for acquisitions in the industries in which we compete, discount rates, terminal growth rates, forecasts of revenue, operating income, depreciation, amortization and capital expenditures. Although we believe our estimates of fair value are reasonable, actual financial results could differ from those estimates due to the inherent uncertainty involved in making such estimates. Changes in assumptions concerning future financial results or other underlying assumptions could have a significant impact on either the fair value of the reporting units, the amount of any goodwill impairment charge, or both. We also compared the sum of the estimated fair values of the reporting units to the Companys fair value as implied by the market value of the Companys equity securities. This comparison indicated that, in total, our assumptions and estimates were reasonable. However, future declines in the overall market value of the Companys equity securities may indicate that the fair value of one or more reporting units has declined below its carrying value. The fair values of the Companys reporting units exceeded their carrying amounts ranging from approximately 11% to approximately 312% . The fair value of our Boots reporting unit, within our Retail Pharmacy International division, is in excess of its carrying value by approximately 11% . We will continue to monitor the U.K. industry and market trends and the impact it may have on the Boots reporting unit. See note 6 , goodwill and other intangible assets , to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.  Indefinite-lived intangible assets are tested by comparing the estimated fair value of the asset to its carrying value. If the carrying value of the asset exceeds its estimated fair value, an impairment loss is recognized and the asset is written down to its estimated fair value. Our indefinite-lived intangible assets fair values are estimated using the relief from royalty method and excess earnings method of the income approach. These estimates can be affected by a number of factors including, but not limited to, general economic conditions, availability of market information as well as our profitability. Cost of sales and inventory  Cost of sales includes the purchase price of goods and cost of services rendered, store and warehouse inventory loss, inventory obsolescence, manufacturing costs and supplier rebates. In addition to product costs, cost of sales includes warehousing costs for retail operations, purchasing costs, freight costs, cash discounts and vendor allowances. Cost of sales for our Retail Pharmacy USA segment is derived based upon point-of-sale scanning information with an estimate for shrinkage and is adjusted based on periodic inventory counts. Inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market determined by the last-in, first-out (LIFO) method for the Retail Pharmacy USA segment and primarily on a first-in first-out (FIFO) basis for inventory in the Retail Pharmacy International and Pharmaceutical Wholesale segments.  Equity method investments   We use the equity method of accounting for equity investments in companies if the investment provides the ability to exercise significant influence, but not control, over operating and financial policies of the investee. Our proportionate share of the net income or loss of these companies is included in consolidated net earnings. Judgment regarding the level of influence over each equity method investment includes considering key factors such as our ownership interest, representation on the board of directors, participation in policy-making decisions and material purchase and sale transactions. We evaluate equity method investments for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the investment might not be recoverable. Factors considered when reviewing an equity method investment for impairment include the length of time (duration) and the extent (severity) to which the fair value of the equity method investment has been less than cost, the investees financial condition and near-term prospects and the intent and ability to hold the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for anticipated recovery. An impairment that is other-than-temporary is recognized in the period identified. - 53 -  Pension and postretirement benefits  We have various defined benefit pension plans that cover some of our non-U.S. employees. We also have a postretirement healthcare plan that covers qualifying U.S. employees. Eligibility and the level of benefits for these plans vary depending on participants status, date of hire and or length of service. Our pension and postretirement plan expenses and valuations are dependent on assumptions used by third-party actuaries in calculating those amounts. These assumptions include discount rates, healthcare cost trends, long-term rate of return on plan assets, retirement rates, mortality rates and other factors. In determining our long-term rate of return on plan assets assumption, we consider both the historical performance of the investment portfolio as well as the long-term market return expectations based on the investment mix of the portfolio. A change in any of these assumptions would have an effect on our projected benefit obligation and pension expense. A 25 basis point increase in the discount rate would result in a decline of $354 million to our pension benefit obligation. A 25 basis point decrease on the expected return on plan assets assumption would increase our pension expense by $21 million. Our policy is to fund our pension plans in accordance with applicable regulations. Our postretirement healthcare plan is not funded.  Income taxes  We are subject to routine income tax audits that occur periodically in the normal course of business. U.S. federal, state, local and foreign tax authorities raise questions regarding our tax filing positions, including the timing and amount of deductions and the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions. In evaluating the tax benefits associated with our various tax filing positions, we record a tax benefit for uncertain tax positions using the highest cumulative tax benefit that is more likely than not to be realized. Adjustments are made to our liability for unrecognized tax benefits in the period in which we determine the issue is effectively settled with the tax authorities, the statute of limitations expires for the return containing the tax position or when more information becomes available. Our liability for unrecognized tax benefits, including accrued penalties and interest, is primarily included in other non-current liabilities and current income taxes on our Consolidated Balance Sheets and in income tax provision in our Consolidated Statements of Earnings.  In determining our provision for income taxes, we use income, permanent differences between book and tax income and enacted statutory income tax rates. The provision for income taxes rate also reflects our assessment of the ultimate outcome of tax audits in addition to any foreign-based income deemed to be taxable in the United States. Discrete events such as audit settlements or changes in tax laws are recognized in the period in which they occur. - 54 - CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS AND COMMITMENTS The following table lists the Companys contractual obligations and commitments at August 31, 2018 (in millions): ##TABLE_START   Payments due by period   Total  Less than 1 year  1-3 years  3-5 years  Over 5 years Operating leases 1  $ 31,088  $ 3,372  $ 5,989  $ 5,002  $ 16,725 Purchase obligations:  2,836  2,408    Open inventory purchase orders  1,862  1,862       Real estate development        Other obligations      Short-term debt and long-term debt *  14,477  1,969  1,796  2,450  8,262 Interest payment on short-term debt and long-term debt  5,155     3,199 Insurance *      Retirement benefit obligations      Closed location obligations 1  1,648     Capital lease obligations *1  1,167     Finance lease obligations      Other liabilities reflected on the balance sheet *2,3      Total  $ 58,936 $ 8,945 $ 10,204 $ 8,837 $ 30,950 ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START * Recorded on balance sheet. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START 1  Amounts do not include certain operating expenses under these leases such as common area maintenance, insurance and real estate taxes, where appropriate.

The Company will make an election to pay the transition tax liability in installments over eight years and, therefore, $682 million of the resulting income taxes liability was recorded as noncurrent income taxes payable in the consolidated balance sheet as of August 31, 2018. ##TABLE_END The information in the foregoing table is presented as of August 31, 2018 and accordingly does not reflect obligations under agreements the Company entered into after that date. OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS The Company does not have any unconsolidated special purpose entities and, except as described herein, the Company does not have significant exposure to any off-balance sheet arrangements. The term off-balance sheet arrangement generally means any transaction, agreement or other contractual arrangement to which an entity unconsolidated with the Company is a party, under which the Company has: (i) any obligation arising under a guarantee contract, derivative instrument or variable interest; or (ii) a retained or contingent interest in assets transferred to such entity or similar arrangement that serves as credit, liquidity or market risk support for such assets. At August 31, 2018 , the Company has issued $218 million in letters of credit, primarily related to insurance obligations. The Company also had $45 million of guarantees outstanding at August 31, 2018 . The Company remains secondarily liable on 16 leases. The maximum potential undiscounted future payments related to these leases was $22 million at August 31, 2018 .

Quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk Interest rate risk The Company is exposed to interest rate volatility with regard to existing debt issuances. Primary exposures include LIBOR and commercial paper rates. From time to time, the Company uses interest rate swaps and forward-starting interest rate swaps to hedge its exposure to the impact of interest rate changes on existing debt and future debt issuances respectively, to reduce the volatility of financing costs and, based on current and projected market conditions, achieve a desired proportion of fixed versus floating-rate debt. Generally under these swaps, the Company agrees with a counterparty to exchange the difference between fixed-rate and floating-rate interest amounts based on an agreed upon notional principal amount. Information regarding our transactions are set forth in note 8 , financial instruments , to the Consolidated Financial Statements. These financial instruments are sensitive to changes in interest rates. On August 31, 2018 , the Company had no material long-term debt obligations that had floating interest rates. The amounts exclude the impact of any associated derivative contracts. Foreign currency exchange rate risk The Company is exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, primarily with respect to the British pound sterling and Euro,  and certain other foreign currencies, which may affect its net investment in foreign subsidiaries and may cause fluctuations in cash flows related to foreign denominated transactions. The Company is also exposed to the translation of foreign currency earnings to the U.S. dollar. The Company enters into foreign currency forward contracts to hedge against the effect of exchange rate fluctuations on non-functional currency cash flows. These transactions are almost exclusively less than 12 months in maturity. In addition, the Company enters into foreign currency forward contracts that are not designated in hedging relationships to offset, in part, the impacts of certain intercompany activities (primarily associated with intercompany financing transactions). The Companys foreign currency derivative instruments are sensitive to changes in exchange rates. A hypothetical 1% change in foreign currency exchange rates versus the U.S. dollar would change the fair value of the foreign currency derivative held as of August 31, 2018 , by approximately $21 million. The foreign currency derivatives are intended to partially hedge anticipated transactions, foreign currency trade payables and receivables and net investments in foreign subsidiaries. Equity price risk Changes in AmerisourceBergen common stock price may have a significant impact on the fair value of the equity investment in AmerisourceBergen described in note 5 , equity method investments , to the Consolidated Financial Statements. See -- AmerisourceBergen Corporation relationship above. - 57 - ", "8": " Item 8. Financial statements and supplementary data WALGREENS BOOTS ALLIANCE, INC.

AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Note 1 . Summary of major accounting policies Organization Walgreens Boots Alliance and its subsidiaries are a global, pharmacy-led health and wellbeing enterprise. Its operations are conducted through three reportable segments: Retail Pharmacy USA, Retail Pharmacy International and Pharmaceutical Wholesale. See note 16 , segment reporting , for further information. Basis of presentation The Consolidated Financial Statements include all subsidiaries in which the Company holds a controlling interest. The Company uses the equity-method of accounting for equity investments in less than majority-owned companies if the investment provides the ability to exercise significant influence. All intercompany transactions have been eliminated. The preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP) requires management to use judgment in the application of accounting policies, including making estimates and assumptions. The Company bases its estimates on the information available at the time, its experience and various other assumptions believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Adjustments may be made in subsequent periods to reflect more current estimates and assumptions about matters that are inherently uncertain. Actual results may differ. The influence of certain holidays, seasonality, foreign currency rates, changes in vendor, payer and customer relationships and terms, strategic transactions including acquisitions, changes in laws and general economic conditions in the markets in which the Company operates and other factors on the Companys operations and net earnings for any period may not be comparable to the same period in previous years.  Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents include cash on hand and highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less. Credit and debit card receivables, which generally settle within two to seven business days, of $127 million and $98 million were included in cash and cash equivalents at August 31, 2018 and 2017 , respectively. Restricted cash The Company is required to maintain cash deposits with certain banks which consist of deposits restricted under contractual agency agreements and cash restricted by law and other obligations. At August 31, 2018 and 2017 , the amount of such restricted cash was $190 million and $202 million , respectively, and is reported in other current assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Accounts receivable Accounts receivable are stated net of allowances for doubtful accounts. Accounts receivable balances primarily consist of trade receivables due from customers, including amounts due from third-party payers (e.g., pharmacy benefit managers, insurance companies and governmental agencies), clients and members. Trade receivables were $5.4 billion and $5.5 billion at August 31, 2018 and August 31, 2017 , respectively. Other accounts receivable balances, which consist primarily of receivables from vendors and manufacturers, including receivables from AmerisourceBergen (see note 17 , related parties ), were $1.2 billion and $1.1 billion at August 31, 2018 and August 31, 2017 , respectively. Charges to allowance for doubtful accounts are based on estimates of recoverability using both historical write-offs and specifically identified receivables. The allowance for doubtful accounts at August 31, 2018 and August 31, 2017 was $75 million and $158 million , respectively. Inventories The Company values inventories on a lower of cost and net realizable value or market. Inventories include product costs, inbound freight, direct labor, warehousing costs for retail pharmacy operations, overhead costs relating to the manufacture and distribution of products and vendor allowances not classified as a reduction of advertising expense. The Companys Retail Pharmacy USA segment inventory is accounted for using the last-in-first-out (LIFO) method. The total carrying value of the segment inventory accounted for under the LIFO method was $6.7 billion and $5.9 billion at August 31, 2018 and 2017 , respectively. At August 31, 2018 and 2017 , Retail Pharmacy USA segment inventory would have been greater by $3.0 billion , if they had been valued on a lower of first-in-first-out (FIFO) cost and net realizable value. - 63 - The Companys Retail Pharmacy International and Pharmaceutical Wholesale segments inventory is primarily accounted for using the FIFO method. The total carrying value of the inventory for Retail Pharmacy International and Pharmaceutical Wholesale segments was $2.8 billion and $3.0 billion at August 31, 2018 and 2017 , respectively. Property, plant and equipment Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation. Major repairs, which extend the useful life of an asset, are capitalized; routine maintenance and repairs are charged against earnings. Depreciation is provided on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of owned assets. Leasehold improvements, equipment under capital lease and capital lease properties are amortized over their respective estimate of useful life or over the term of the lease, whichever is shorter. The majority of the Companys fixtures and equipment uses the composite method of depreciation. Therefore, gains and losses on retirement or other disposition of such assets are included in earnings only when an operating location is closed, substantially remodeled or impaired. The following table summarizes the Companys property, plant and equipment (in millions) and estimated useful lives (in years): ##TABLE_START   Estimated useful life   Land and land improvements   $ 3,593  $ 3,470 Buildings and building improvements  3 to 50  7,874  7,431 Fixtures and equipment  3 to 20  9,750  9,209 Capitalized system development costs and software  3 to 8  2,464  2,105 Capital lease properties         24,424  22,960 Less: accumulated depreciation and amortization    10,513  9,318 Balance at end of year    $ 13,911  $ 13,642 ##TABLE_ENDThe Company capitalizes application development stage costs for internally developed software. These costs are amortized over a three to eight year period. Amortization expense for capitalized system development costs and software was $254 million in fiscal 2018 , $245 million in fiscal 2017 and $238 million in fiscal 2016 . Unamortized costs at August 31, 2018 and 2017 were $1.5 billion and $895 million , respectively. Depreciation and amortization expense for property, plant and equipment including capitalized system development costs and software was $1.4 billion in fiscal 2018 , $1.3 billion in fiscal 2017 and $1.3 billion in fiscal 2016 . Leases Initial terms for leased premises in the U.S. are typically 15 to 25 years, followed by additional terms containing renewal options at five -year intervals, and may include rent escalation clauses. Non-U.S. leases are typically for shorter terms and may include cancellation clauses or renewal options. The commencement date of all lease terms is the earlier of the date the Company becomes legally obligated to make rent payments or the date the Company has the right to control the property. In addition to minimum fixed rentals, some leases provide for contingent rentals based upon a portion of sales. Capital leases are recognized within property, plant and equipment and as a capital lease liability within accrued expenses and other liabilities and other non-current liabilities. Operating leases are expensed on a straight line basis over the lease term. See note 4 , leases , for further information. Business combinations The Company allocates the fair value of purchase consideration to the tangible and intangible assets purchased and the liabilities assumed on the basis of their fair values at the date of acquisition. The determination of fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed requires estimates and the use of valuation techniques when a market value is not readily available. Any excess of purchase price over the fair value of net tangible and intangible assets acquired is allocated to goodwill. If the Company obtains new information about facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date during the measurement period, which may be up to one year from the acquisition date, the Company may record adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed. Goodwill and other intangible assets Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in business combinations. Acquired intangible assets are recorded at fair value. - 64 - Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are evaluated for impairment annually during the fourth quarter, or more frequently if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit or intangible asset below its carrying value. As part of the Companys impairment analysis, fair value of a reporting unit is determined using both the income and market approaches. The income approach requires management to estimate a number of factors for each reporting unit, including projected future operating results, economic projections, anticipated future cash flows and discount rates. The market approach estimates fair value using comparable marketplace fair value data from within a comparable industry grouping. Finite-lived intangible assets are amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives. See note 6 , goodwill and other intangible assets , for additional disclosure regarding the Companys intangible assets. Equity method investments The Company uses the equity method of accounting for equity investments in companies if the investment provides the ability to exercise significant influence, but not control, over operating and financial policies of the investee. The Companys proportionate share of the net income or loss of these companies is included in consolidated net earnings. Judgment regarding the level of influence over each equity method investment includes considering key factors such as the Companys ownership interest, representation on the board of directors, participation in policy-making decisions and material intra-entity transactions. The Company evaluates equity method investments for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the investment might not be recoverable. Factors considered by the Company when reviewing an equity method investment for impairment include the length of time (duration) and the extent (severity) to which the fair value of the equity method investment has been less than cost, the investees financial condition and near-term prospects and the intent and ability to hold the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for anticipated recovery. An impairment that is other-than-temporary is recognized in the period identified. See note 5 , equity method investments , for further information. Financial instruments The Company uses derivative instruments to hedge its exposure to interest rate and currency risks arising from operating and financing activities. In accordance with its risk management policies, the Company does not hold or issue derivative instruments for trading or speculative purposes. Derivatives are recognized on the Consolidated Balance Sheets at their fair values. When the Company becomes a party to a derivative instrument and intends to apply hedge accounting, it formally documents the hedge relationship and the risk management objective for undertaking the hedge which includes designating the instrument for financial reporting purposes as a fair value hedge, a cash flow hedge, or a net investment hedge. The accounting for changes in fair value of a derivative instrument depends on whether the Company had designated it in a qualifying hedging relationship and on the type of hedging relationship. The Company applies the following accounting policies: ##TABLE_START  Changes in the fair value of a derivative designated as a fair value hedge, along with the gain or loss on the hedged asset or liability attributable to the hedged risk, are recorded in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings in the same line item, generally interest expense, net. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Changes in the fair value of a derivative designated as a cash flow hedge are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income and reclassified into earnings in the period or periods during which the hedged item affects earnings and is presented in the same line item as the earnings effect of the hedged item. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Changes in the fair value of a derivative designated as a hedge of a net investment in a foreign operation are recorded in cumulative translation adjustments within accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income. Recognition in earnings of amounts previously recorded in cumulative translation adjustments is limited to circumstances such as complete or substantially complete liquidation of the net investment in the hedged investments in foreign operations. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Changes in the fair value of a derivative not designated in a hedging relationship are recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings. ##TABLE_END Cash receipts or payments on a settlement of a derivative contract are reported in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows consistent with the nature of the underlying hedged item. - 65 - For derivative instruments designated as hedges, the Company assesses, both at the hedges inception and on an ongoing basis, whether the derivatives that are used in hedging transactions are highly effective in offsetting changes in fair values or cash flows of hedged items. Highly effective means that cumulative changes in the fair value of the derivative are between 80% and 125% of the cumulative changes in the fair value of the hedged item. In addition, when the Company determines that a derivative is not highly effective as a hedge, hedge accounting is discontinued. When it is probable that a hedged forecasted transaction will not occur, the Company discontinues hedge accounting for the affected portion of the forecasted transaction and reclassifies any gains or losses in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) to earnings in the Consolidated Statement of Earnings. When a derivative in a hedge relationship is terminated or the hedged item is sold, extinguished or terminated, hedge accounting is discontinued prospectively.  Liabilities for facility closings The Company provides for future costs related to closed locations. The liability is based on the present value of future rent obligations and other related costs (net of estimated sublease rent) to the first lease option date. The liability for facility closings, including locations closed under the Companys restructuring actions, was $964 million as of August 31, 2018 and $718 million as of August 31, 2017 . See note 4 , leases , for further information.  Pension and postretirement benefits The Company has various defined benefit pension plans that cover some of its non-U.S. employees. The Company also has a postretirement healthcare plan that covers qualifying U.S. employees. Eligibility and the level of benefits for these plans vary depending on participants status, date of hire and or length of service. Pension and postretirement plan expenses and valuations are dependent on assumptions used by third-party actuaries in calculating those amounts. These assumptions include discount rates, healthcare cost trends, long-term return on plan assets, retirement rates, mortality rates and other factors. The Company funds its pension plans in accordance with applicable regulations. See note 13 , retirement benefits , for further information. Noncontrolling interests The Company presents noncontrolling interests as a component of equity on its Consolidated Balance Sheets and reports the portion of its earnings or loss for noncontrolling interest as net earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests in the Consolidated Statement of Earnings. Currency Assets and liabilities of non-U.S. dollar functional currency operations are translated into U.S. dollars at end-of-period exchange rates while revenues, expenses and cash flows are translated at average monthly exchange rates over the period. Equity is translated at historical exchange rates and the resulting cumulative translation adjustments are included as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Assets and liabilities not denominated in the functional currency are remeasured into the functional currency at end-of-period exchange rates, except for nonmonetary balance sheet amounts, which are remeasured at historical exchange rates. Revenues and expenses are recorded at average monthly exchange rates over the period, except for those expenses related to nonmonetary balance sheet amounts, which are remeasured at historical exchange rates. Gains or losses from foreign currency remeasurement are generally included in selling, general and administrative expenses within the Consolidated Statements of Earnings. For all periods presented, there were no material operational gains or losses from foreign currency transactions. Commitments and contingencies On a quarterly basis, the Company assesses its liabilities and contingencies for outstanding legal proceedings and reserves are established on a case-by-case basis for those legal claims for which management concludes that it is probable that a loss will be incurred and that the amount of such loss can be reasonably estimated. Substantially all of these contingencies are subject to significant uncertainties and, therefore, determining the likelihood of a loss and/or the measurement of any loss can be complex. With respect to litigation and other legal proceedings where the Company has determined that a loss is reasonably possible, the Company may be unable to estimate the amount or range of reasonably possible loss due to the inherent difficulty of predicting the outcome of and uncertainties regarding such litigation and legal proceedings. The Companys assessments are based on estimates and assumptions that have been deemed reasonable by management, but that may prove to be incomplete or inaccurate, and unanticipated events and circumstances may occur that might cause the Company to change those estimates and assumptions. Therefore, it is possible that an unfavorable resolution of one or more pending litigation or other contingencies could have a material adverse effect on the Companys Consolidated Financial Statements in a future fiscal period. Managements assessment of current litigation and other legal proceedings, including the corresponding accruals, could change because of the discovery of facts with respect to legal actions or other proceedings pending against the Company which are not presently known. Adverse rulings or determinations by judges, juries, governmental authorities or other parties could also result in changes to managements assessment of current liabilities and contingencies. Accordingly, the ultimate costs of resolving - 66 - these claims may be substantially higher or lower than the amounts reserved. See note 10 , commitments and contingencies , for further information. Revenue recognition Revenue is recognized when: (i) persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, (ii) delivery has occurred or services have been rendered, (iii) the sellers price to the buyer is fixed or determinable and (iv) collectability is reasonably assured. The following revenue recognition policies have been established for the Companys reportable segments. Retail Pharmacy USA and Retail Pharmacy International The Company recognizes revenue, net of taxes and estimated returns, at the time it sells merchandise or dispenses prescription drugs to the customer. Returns are estimated using historical experience. The Company initially estimates revenue based on expected reimbursements from third-party payers (e.g., pharmacy benefit managers, insurance companies and governmental agencies) for dispensing prescription drugs. The estimates are based on historical experience and are updated to actual reimbursement amounts. Pharmaceutical Wholesale Wholesale revenue is recognized, net of taxes, upon shipment of goods, which is generally also the day of delivery. When the Company acts in the capacity of an agent or a logistics service provider, revenue is the fee received for the service and is recognized when the services have been performed. Cost of sales Cost of sales includes the purchase price of goods and cost of services rendered, store and warehouse inventory loss, inventory obsolescence, manufacturing costs and supplier rebates. In addition to product costs, cost of sales includes warehousing costs for retail operations, purchasing costs, freight costs, cash discounts and vendor allowances. Vendor allowances and supplier rebates Vendor allowances are principally received as a result of purchases, sales or promotion of vendors products. Allowances are generally recorded as a reduction of inventory and are recognized as a reduction of cost of sales when the related merchandise is sold. Allowances received for promoting vendors products are offset against advertising expense and result in a reduction of selling, general and administrative expenses to the extent of advertising costs incurred, with the excess treated as a reduction of inventory costs. Rebates or refunds received by the Company from its suppliers, mostly in cash, are considered as an adjustment of the prices of the suppliers products purchased by the Company. Loyalty programs The Companys loyalty rewards programs are accrued as a charge to cost of sales at the time a point is earned. Points are funded internally and through vendor participation and are credited to cost of sales at the time a vendor-sponsored point is earned. Breakage is recorded as points expire as a result of a members inactivity or if the points remain unredeemed after a certain period in accordance with the terms of the loyalty rewards program. Breakage income, which is reported in cost of sales, was not significant in fiscal 2018, 2017 or 2016. Selling, general and administrative expenses Selling, general and administrative expenses mainly consist of salaries and employee costs, occupancy costs, depreciation and amortization, credit and debit card fees and expenses directly related to stores. In addition, other costs included are headquarters expenses, advertising costs (net of vendor advertising allowances), wholesale warehousing costs and insurance. Advertising costs Advertising costs, which are reduced by the portion funded by vendors, are expensed as incurred or when services have been received. Net advertising expenses, which are included in selling, general and administrative expenses, were $665 million in fiscal 2018 , $571 million in fiscal 2017 and $598 million in fiscal 2016 . Impairment of long-lived assets The Company tests long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that a certain asset or asset group may be impaired. Once identified, the amount of the impairment is computed by comparing the carrying value of the assets to the fair value, which is primarily based on the discounted estimated future cash flows. Impairment charges included in selling, general and administrative expenses were $57 million in fiscal 2018 . Impairment charges recognized in fiscal 2017 and 2016 were $234 million and $305 million , respectively. - 67 - Stock compensation plans Stock based compensation is measured at fair value at the grant date. The Company grants stock options, performance shares and restricted units to the Companys non-employee directors, officers and employees. The Company recognizes compensation expense on a straight-line basis over the substantive service period. See note 12 , stock compensation plans , for more information on the Companys stock-based compensation plans. Warrants Until their exercise in fiscal 2016, the warrants to acquire shares of AmerisourceBergen Corporation were accounted for as a derivative under ASC Topic 815, Derivatives and Hedging. The Company reports its warrants at fair value within other non-current assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets and changes in the fair value of warrants are recognized in other income in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings. A deferred credit from the day-one valuation attributable to the warrants granted to Walgreens was amortized over the life of the warrants. See note 8 , financial instruments , for additional disclosure regarding the Companys warrants. Insurance The Company obtains insurance coverage for catastrophic exposures as well as those risks required by law to be insured. In general, the Companys U.S. subsidiaries retain a significant portion of losses related to workers compensation, property, comprehensive general, pharmacist and vehicle liability, while non-U.S. subsidiaries manage their exposures through insurance coverage with third-party carriers. Management regularly reviews the probable outcome of claims and proceedings, the expenses expected to be incurred, the availability and limits of the insurance coverage and the established accruals for liabilities. Liabilities for losses are recorded based upon the Companys estimates for both claims incurred and claims incurred but not reported. The provisions are estimated in part by considering historical claims experience, demographic factors and other actuarial assumptions. Income taxes The Company accounts for income taxes according to the asset and liability method. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized based upon the estimated future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured pursuant to tax laws using rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rate is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. Valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amounts more likely than not to be realized. In determining the provision for income taxes, the Company uses income, permanent differences between book and tax income, the relative proportion of foreign and domestic income, enacted statutory income tax rates, projections of income subject to Subpart F rules and unrecognized tax benefits related to current year results. Discrete events such as the assessment of the ultimate outcome of tax audits, audit settlements, recognizing previously unrecognized tax benefits due to lapsing of the applicable statute of limitations, recognizing or de-recognizing benefits of deferred tax assets due to future year financial statement projections and changes in tax laws are recognized in the period in which they occur. The Company is subject to routine income tax audits that occur periodically in the normal course of business. U.S. federal, state, local and foreign tax authorities raise questions regarding the Companys tax filing positions, including the timing and amount of deductions and the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions. In evaluating the tax benefits associated with the various tax filing positions, the Company records a tax benefit for uncertain tax positions using the highest cumulative tax benefit that is more likely than not to be realized. Adjustments are made to the liability for unrecognized tax benefits in the period in which the Company determines the issue is effectively settled with the tax authorities, the statute of limitations expires for the return containing the tax position or when more information becomes available. Earnings per share The dilutive effect of outstanding stock options on earnings per share is calculated using the treasury stock method. Stock options are anti-dilutive and excluded from the earnings per share calculation if the exercise price exceeds the average market price of the common shares. Outstanding options to purchase common shares that were anti-dilutive and excluded from earnings per share totaled 10.1 million , 3.9 million and 2.5 million in fiscal 2018 , 2017 and 2016 , respectively. New accounting pronouncements Adoption of new accounting pronouncements Accounting for hedging activities In August 2017, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2017-12, Derivative and Hedging (Topic 815): - 68 - Targeted Improvements to Accounting for Hedging Activities. This ASU expands an entitys ability to hedge nonfinancial and financial risk components and reduces complexity in fair value hedges of interest rate risk. It eliminates the requirement to separately measure and report hedge ineffectiveness and generally requires the entire change in the fair value of a hedging instrument to be presented in the same income statement line as the hedged item. It also eases certain documentation and assessment requirements and modifies the accounting for components excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness. This ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018 (fiscal 2020), and interim periods within those fiscal years, with early adoption permitted. The Company early adopted this guidance during the third fiscal quarter of 2018. The adoption did not have any impact on the Companys results of operations, cash flows or financial position. Measurement of inventory In July 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-11, Inventory (Topic 330): Simplifying the Measurement of Inventory. This ASU simplifies current accounting treatments by requiring entities to measure most inventories at the lower of cost and net realizable value rather than using lower of cost or market. This guidance does not apply to inventories measured using last-in, first-out method or the retail inventory method. This ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016 (fiscal 2018), and interim periods within those fiscal years. The Company adopted this guidance on a prospective basis at the beginning of fiscal 2018 and adoption did not have a material impact on the Companys results of operations, cash flows or financial position. New accounting pronouncements not yet adopted Intangibles  goodwill and other  internal-use software In August 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-15, Intangibles-Goodwill and Other- Internal-Use Software (Subtopic 350-40). This ASU addresses customers accounting for implementation costs incurred in a cloud computing arrangement that is a service contract and also adds certain disclosure requirements related to implementation costs incurred for internal-use software and cloud computing arrangements. The amendment aligns the requirements for capitalizing implementation costs incurred in a hosting arrangement that is a service contract with the requirements for capitalizing implementation costs incurred to develop or obtain internal-use software (and hosting arrangements that include an internal-use software license). This ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019 (fiscal 2021), and interim periods within those fiscal years, with early adoption permitted. The amendments in this ASU can be applied either retrospectively or prospectively to all implementation costs incurred after the date of adoption. The Company is evaluating the effect of adopting this new accounting guidance, but does not expect adoption will have a material impact on the Companys financial position or results of operations. Compensation  retirement benefits  defined benefit plans In August 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-14, Compensation - Retirement benefits (Topic 715-20). This ASU amends ASC 715 to add, remove and clarify disclosure requirements related to defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans. The ASU eliminates the requirement to disclose the amounts in accumulated other comprehensive income expected to be recognized as part of net periodic benefit cost over the next year. The ASU also removes the disclosure requirements for the effects of a one-percentage-point change on the assumed health care costs and the effect of this change in rates on service cost, interest cost and the benefit obligation for postretirement health care benefits. This ASU is effective for fiscal years ending after December 15, 2020 (fiscal 2022) and must be applied on a retrospective basis. The Company is evaluating the effect of adopting this new accounting guidance, but does not expect adoption will have a material impact on the Company's financial position. Fair value measurement In August 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-13, Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820). The ASU eliminates such disclosures as the amount of and reasons for transfers between Level 1 and Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. The ASU adds new disclosure requirements for Level 3 measurements. This ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019 (fiscal 2021), and interim periods within those fiscal years, with early adoption permitted for any eliminated or modified disclosures. The Company is evaluating the effect of adopting this new accounting guidance, but does not expect adoption will have a material impact on the Company's disclosures. Compensation  stock compensation In June 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-07, Compensation-Stock Compensation (Topic 718). This ASU eliminated most of the differences between accounting guidance for share-based compensation granted to nonemployees and the guidance for share-based compensation granted to employees. The ASU supersedes the guidance for nonemployees and expands the scope of the guidance for employees to include both. This ASU is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2018 (fiscal 2020), and interim periods within those years. The Company is evaluating the effect of adopting this new accounting guidance, but does not expect adoption will have a material impact on the Company's financial position. Accounting for reclassification of certain tax effects from accumulated other comprehensive income - 69 - In February 2018, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2018-02, Income Statement-Reporting Comprehensive Income (Topic 220): Reclassification of Certain Tax Effects from Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income. This ASU addresses the income tax effects of items in accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI) which were originally recognized in other comprehensive income, rather than in income from continuing operations. Specifically, it permits a reclassification from AOCI to retained earnings for the adjustment of deferred taxes due to the reduction of the historical corporate income tax rate to the newly enacted corporate income tax rate resulting from the U.S. tax law changes enacted in December 2017. It also requires certain disclosures about these reclassifications. This ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018 (fiscal 2020), and interim periods within those fiscal years, with early adoption permitted. The new guidance must be applied either on a prospective basis in the period of adoption or retrospectively to each period (or periods) in which the effect of the change in the U.S. federal corporate income tax rate in the U.S. tax law changes are recognized. The Company is evaluating the effect of adopting this new accounting guidance, but does not expect adoption will have a material impact on the Companys financial position. Presentation of net periodic pension cost and net periodic postretirement benefit cost In March 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-07, Compensation - Retirement Benefits (Topic 715): Improving the Presentation of Net Periodic Pension Cost and Net Periodic Postretirement Benefit Cost. This ASU requires an employer to report the service cost component of net periodic pension cost and net periodic postretirement cost in the same line item in the statement of earnings as other compensation costs arising from services rendered by the related employees during the period. The other net cost components are required to be presented in the statement of earnings separately from the service cost component and outside a subtotal of income from operations. Additionally, the line item used in the statement of earnings to present the other net cost components must be disclosed in the notes to the financial statements. This ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017 (fiscal 2019), and interim periods within those fiscal years, and must be applied on a retrospective basis. The Company has evaluated the effect of adopting this new accounting guidance and determined that adoption will not have a material impact on the Companys results of operations. The Company will adopt this new accounting guidance as of September 1, 2018 (fiscal 2019). Restricted cash In November 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-18, Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Restricted Cash. This ASU requires that a statement of cash flows explain the change during the period in the total of cash, cash equivalents and amounts generally described as restricted cash or restricted cash equivalents. Therefore, amounts generally described as restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents should be included with cash and cash equivalents when reconciling the beginning-of-period and end-of-period total amounts shown on the Statement of Cash Flows. This ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017 (fiscal 2019), and interim periods within those fiscal years, with early adoption permitted. The new guidance must be applied on a retrospective basis. The Company has evaluated the effect of adopting this new accounting guidance and determined that adoption will not have a material impact on the Companys Statement of Cash Flows. The Company will adopt this new accounting guidance as of September 1, 2018 (fiscal 2019). Tax accounting for intra-entity asset transfers In October 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-16, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Intra-Entity Transfers of Assets Other Than Inventory. Topic 740, Income Taxes, prohibits the recognition of current and deferred income taxes for an intra-entity asset transfer until the asset has been sold to an outside party. In addition, interpretations of this guidance have developed in practice for transfers of certain intangible and tangible assets. This prohibition on recognition is an exception to the principle of comprehensive recognition of current and deferred income taxes in GAAP. To more faithfully represent the economics of intra-entity asset transfers, the amendments in this ASU require that entities recognize the income tax consequences of an intra-entity transfer of an asset other than inventory when the transfer occurs. The amendments in this ASU do not change GAAP for the pre-tax effects of an intra-entity asset transfer under Topic 810, Consolidation, or for an intra-entity transfer of inventory. This ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017 (fiscal 2019), including interim periods within those fiscal years, with early adoption permitted. The new guidance must be applied on a modified retrospective basis through a cumulative effect adjustment recognized directly to retained earnings as of the date of adoption. The Company has evaluated the effect of adopting this new accounting guidance and determined that adoption will not have a material impact on the Companys results of operations. The Company will adopt this new accounting guidance as of September 1, 2018 (fiscal 2019). Classification of certain cash receipts and cash payments In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-15, Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments. This ASU addresses the classification of certain specific cash flow issues including debt prepayment or extinguishment costs, settlement of certain debt instruments, contingent consideration payments made after a business combination, proceeds from the settlement of certain insurance claims and distributions received from equity method investees. This ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017 (fiscal 2019), and interim periods within those fiscal years, with early adoption permitted. An entity that elects early adoption must adopt all of the amendments in the same period - 70 - and the new guidance must be applied on a retrospective basis. The Company has evaluated the effect of adopting this new accounting guidance and determined that adoption will not have a material impact on the Companys Statement of Cash Flows. The Company will adopt this new accounting guidance as of September 1, 2018 (fiscal 2019). Leases In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842), which supersedes Topic 840, Leases. Subsequently, the FASB has issued additional ASUs which further clarify this guidance. This ASU increases the transparency and comparability of organizations by requiring the capitalization of substantially all leases on the balance sheet and disclosures of key information about leasing arrangements. Under this new guidance, at the lease commencement date, a lessee recognizes a right- of-use asset and lease liability, which is initially measured at the present value of the future lease payments. For income statement purposes, a dual model was retained for lessees, requiring leases to be classified as either operating or finance leases. Under the operating lease model, lease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Under the finance lease model, interest on the lease liability is recognized separately from amortization of the right-of-use asset. The new guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018 (fiscal 2020), and interim periods within those fiscal years. In transition, lessees are required to recognize and measure leases at the beginning of the earliest period presented (fiscal 2018) using a modified retrospective approach which includes a number of optional practical expedients that entities may elect to apply. In July 2018, a new ASU was issued to provide relief to the companies from restating the comparative period. Pursuant to this ASU, WBA will not restate comparative periods presented in the Companys financial statements in the period of adoption. The Company will adopt this ASU on September 1, 2019 (fiscal 2020). The Company has begun evaluating and planning for adoption and implementation of this ASU, including implementing a new global lease accounting system, evaluating practical expedient and accounting policy elections and assessing the overall financial statement impact. This ASU will have a material impact on the Companys financial position. The impact on the Companys results of operations is being evaluated. The impact of this ASU is non-cash in nature and will not affect the Companys cash flows. Classification and measurement of financial instruments In January 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-01, Financial Instruments - Overall (Subtopic 825-10): Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities. Subsequently, the FASB has issued additional ASUs which further clarify this guidance. This ASU requires equity investments (except those under the equity method of accounting or those that result in the consolidation of an investee) to be measured at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in net income. However, an entity may choose to measure equity investments that do not have readily determinable fair values at cost less impairment, if any, and changes resulting from observable price changes in orderly transactions for the identical or a similar investment of the same issuer. This simplifies the impairment assessment of equity investments previous held at cost. Separate presentation of financial assets and liabilities by measurement category is required. This ASU is effective prospectively for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017 (fiscal 2019), and interim periods within those fiscal years. Early application is permitted, for fiscal years or interim periods that have not yet been issued as of the beginning of the fiscal year of adoption. The new guidance must be applied on a modified retrospective basis, with the exception of the amendments related to the measurement alternative for equity investments without readily determinable fair values, which must be applied on a prospective basis. The Company has evaluated the effect of adopting this new accounting guidance and determined that adoption will not have a material impact on the Companys results of operations. The Company will adopt this new accounting guidance as of September 1, 2018 (fiscal 2019). Revenue recognition on contracts with customers In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606). This ASU provides a single principles-based revenue recognition model with a five-step analysis of transactions to determine when and how revenue is recognized. The core principle is that a company should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. Subsequently, the FASB has issued additional ASUs which further clarify this guidance and also defer the effective date by one year to fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017 (fiscal 2019), and interim periods within those fiscal years. The Company will use the modified retrospective method as the transition approach when adopting this new accounting guidance on September 1, 2018 (fiscal 2019). The Company has evaluated the effect of adopting this new accounting guidance, the related amendments and the interpretive guidance on the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements and determined that adoption will not have a material impact on the Companys results of operations and will be limited to immaterial changes to recognition of revenues related to loyalty programs and gift cards, in addition to disaggregated revenue disclosures. Specifically, the Company currently uses the cost approach to account for loyalty programs. Upon adoption, the Company will use the deferred revenue approach. Additionally, gift card breakage currently is recognized at point of sale by the Retail Pharmacy USA segment and upon expiration primarily within the Retail Pharmacy International segment. Upon adoption of the new revenue recognition guidance, all breakage will be recognized based on the pattern in which the - 71 - customer redeems the gift cards. Note 2 . Acquisitions Acquisition of certain Rite Aid assets On September 19, 2017, the Company announced that it had secured regulatory clearance for an amended and restated asset purchase agreement to purchase 1,932 stores, three distribution centers and related inventory from Rite Aid for $4.375 billion in cash and other consideration. The purchases of these stores have been accounted for as business combinations and occurred in waves during fiscal 2018. The Company purchased 1,932 stores for total cash consideration of $4.2 billion for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2018 . The transition of the first distribution center and related inventory occurred in September 2018 and the transition of the remaining two distribution centers and related inventory remains subject to closing conditions set forth in the amended and restated asset purchase agreement. As of August 31, 2018 , the Company had not completed the analysis to assign fair values to all assets acquired and liabilities assumed and therefore the purchase price allocation has not been finalized. The preliminary purchase price allocation will be subject to further refinement and may result in material changes as the Company is awaiting additional information to complete its assessment. During the twelve months ended August 31, 2018 , the Company recorded certain measurement period adjustments based on additional information primarily to deferred income taxes, other non-current liabilities and inventories, which did not have a material impact on goodwill. The following table summarizes the consideration for the purchases and the preliminary amounts of identified assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of the fiscal year ended August 31, 2018 . ##TABLE_START Consideration $ 4,330   Identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed  Inventories $ 1,171 Property, plant and equipment Intangible assets 2,054 Accrued expenses and other liabilities (54 ) Deferred income taxes Other non-current liabilities (960 ) Total identifiable net assets 2,986 Goodwill $ 1,344 ##TABLE_ENDThe preliminary identified definite-lived intangible assets were as follows: ##TABLE_START Definite-lived intangible assets Weighted-average useful life (in years) Amount (in millions) Customer relationships $ 1,810 Favorable lease interests 224 Trade names 20 Total  $ 2,054 ##TABLE_ENDConsideration includes cash of $4,157 million and the fair value of the option granted to Rite Aid to become a member of the Companys group purchasing organization, Walgreens Boots Alliance Development GmbH. The fair value for this option was determined using the income approach methodology. The fair value estimates are based on the market compensation for such services and appropriate discount rate, as relevant, that market participants would consider when estimating fair values. The goodwill of $1,344 million arising from the business combinations primarily reflects the expected operational synergies and cost savings generated from the Store Optimization Program as well as the expected growth from new customers. See note 3 , exit and disposal activities , for additional information. The goodwill was allocated to the Retail Pharmacy USA segment. Substantially all of the goodwill recognized is expected to be deductible for income tax purposes. The fair value for customer relationships was determined using the multi-period excess earnings method, a form of the income approach. Real property fair values were determined using primarily the income approach and sales comparison approach. The fair value measurements of the intangible assets are based on significant inputs not observable in the market and thus represent Level 3 measurements. The fair value estimates for the intangible assets are based on projected discounted cash flows, - 72 - historical and projected financial information and attrition rates, as relevant, that market participants would consider when estimating fair values. The following table presents supplemental unaudited condensed pro forma consolidated sales for the fiscal years ended 2018 and 2017 as if all 1,932 stores were acquired on September 1, 2016. Pro forma net earnings of the Company, assuming these purchases had occurred at the beginning of each period presented, would not be materially different from the results reported. See note 3 , exit and disposal activities , for additional information. The unaudited condensed pro forma information has been prepared for comparative purposes only and is not intended to be indicative of what the Companys results would have been had the purchases occurred at the beginning of the periods presented or results which may occur in the future. ##TABLE_START (in millions) 2018 1  Sales $ 135,503  $ 127,893 ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START 1  Impacted by store closures due to the Store Optimization Program. ##TABLE_END Actual sales from acquired Rite Aid stores for the fiscal year ended 2018 included in the Consolidated Statement of Earnings are as follows: ##TABLE_START (in millions) Sales $ 5,112 ##TABLE_ENDThe 1,932 Rite Aid stores acquired did not have a material impact on net earnings of the Company for the fiscal year ended 2018 . AllianceRx Walgreens Prime On March 31, 2017, Walgreens Boots Alliance and pharmacy benefit manager Prime Therapeutics LLC (Prime) closed a transaction to form a combined central specialty pharmacy and mail services company AllianceRx Walgreens Prime, as part of a strategic alliance. AllianceRx Walgreens Prime is consolidated by Walgreens Boots Alliance and reported within the Retail Pharmacy USA division in its financial statements. The Company accounted for this acquisition of Primes specialty pharmacy and mail services business as a business combination involving noncash purchase consideration of $720 million consisting of the issuance of an equity interest in AllianceRx Walgreens Prime. The Company has completed the purchase accounting for the AllianceRx Walgreens Prime transaction. The following table summarizes the consideration for the acquisition and the amounts of identified assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the date of the transaction (in millions). ##TABLE_START Total consideration $   Identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed  Accounts receivable $ Inventories Property, plant and equipment Intangible assets Trade accounts payable (90 ) Accrued expenses and other liabilities (1 ) Total identifiable net assets Goodwill $ ##TABLE_ENDThe identified intangible assets primarily include payer contracts. These contracts are estimated to have a weighted average useful life of 15 years. The goodwill of $103 million arising from the transaction consists of expected purchasing synergies, operating efficiencies by benchmarking performance and applying best practices across the combined company, consolidation of operations, reductions in selling, general and administrative expenses and combining workforces. Substantially all of the goodwill recognized is not expected to be deductible for income tax purposes. - 73 - In accordance with ASC Topic 810, Consolidation, the noncontrolling interest was recognized based on its proportionate interest in the identifiable net assets of AllianceRx Walgreens Prime. The difference between the carrying amount of the noncontrolling interest and the fair value recognized as consideration in the business combination is recognized as additional paid in capital. Pro forma net earnings and sales of the Company, assuming the acquisition had occurred at the beginning of each period presented, would not be materially different from the results reported. The acquisition did not have a material impact on net earnings or sales of the Company for fiscal 2017. Note 3 . Exit and disposal activities Store Optimization Program On October 24, 2017, the Companys Board of Directors approved a plan to implement a program (the Store Optimization Program) as part of an initiative to optimize store locations through the planned closure of approximately 600 stores and related assets within the Companys Retail Pharmacy USA segment upon completion of the acquisition of certain stores and related assets from Rite Aid. The actions under the Store Optimization Program commenced in March 2018 and are expected to take place over an 18 month period. The Company currently estimates that it will recognize cumulative pre-tax charges to its GAAP financial results of approximately $450 million , including costs associated with lease obligations and other real estate costs, employee severance and other exit costs. The Company expects to incur pre-tax charges of approximately $270 million for lease obligations and other real estate costs and approximately $180 million for employee severance and other exit costs. The Company estimates that substantially all of these cumulative pre-tax charges will result in cash expenditures. Costs related to the Store Optimization Program, which were primarily recorded in selling, general and administrative expenses for the Company's Retail Pharmacy USA segment included in the fiscal year ended August 31, 2018 , are as follows (in millions): ##TABLE_START Fiscal year ended August 31, 2018  Lease obligations and other real estate costs $ Employee severance and other exit costs Total costs $ ##TABLE_ENDThe changes in liabilities related to the Store Optimization Program for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2018 include the following (in millions): ##TABLE_START  Lease obligations and other real estate costs  Employee severance and other exit costs  Total Balance at August 31, 2017 $   $   $  Costs   Payments (18 )  (60 )  (78 ) Other - non cash 1    Balance at August 31, 2018 $  $  $ ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START 1  Primarily represents unfavorable lease liabilities from acquired Rite Aid stores. ##TABLE_END Cost Transformation Program On April 8, 2015, the Walgreens Boots Alliance Board of Directors approved a plan to implement a restructuring program (the Cost Transformation Program) as part of an initiative to reduce costs and increase operating efficiencies.

The Company accounts for its equity investment in AmerisourceBergen using the equity method of accounting, with the net earnings attributable to the Companys investment being classified within the operating income of its Pharmaceutical Wholesale segment. Due to the timing and availability of financial information of AmerisourceBergen, the Company accounts for this equity method investment on a financial reporting lag of two months. Equity earnings from AmerisourceBergen are reported as a separate line in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings. The Level 1 fair market value of the Companys equity investment in AmerisourceBergen common stock at August 31, 2018 was $5.1 billion . As of August 31, 2018 , the Companys investment in AmerisourceBergen carrying value exceeded its proportionate share of the net assets of AmerisourceBergen by $4.3 billion . This premium of $4.3 billion was recognized as part of the carrying value in the Companys equity investment in AmerisourceBergen. The difference was primarily related to goodwill and the fair value of AmerisourceBergen intangible assets.  Other investments - 76 - The Companys other equity method investments include its investments in Guangzhou Pharmaceuticals Corporation (Guangzhou Pharmaceuticals) and Nanjing Pharmaceutical Corporation Limited, the Companys pharmaceutical wholesale investments in China; its investment in Sinopharm Holding Guoda Drugstores Co., Ltd., the Company's retail pharmacy investment in China and the Companys investment in Option Care Inc. in the U.S. The Company reported $53 million , $8 million and $44 million of post-tax equity earnings from other equity method investments, including equity method investments classified as operating, for the fiscal years ended 2018 , 2017 and 2016 , respectively. During the fiscal year ended August 31, 2018 , the Company recorded an impairment of $170 million in its equity interest in Guangzhou Pharmaceuticals, which was included in other income (expense) in the Consolidated Statement of Earnings. The fair value of the Companys equity interest in Guangzhou Pharmaceuticals was determined using the proposed sale price and thus represents Level 3 measurement. During the fiscal year ended August 31, 2018 , the Company completed the sale of a 30 percent interest in Guangzhou Pharmaceuticals to its joint venture partner Guangzhou Baiyunshan Pharmaceutical Holdings resulting in a $172 million reduction in carrying value and a $8 million cumulative translation adjustment loss.

Goodwill and other intangible assets The fair values of the Companys reporting units exceeded their carrying amounts ranging from approximately 11% to approximately 312% . The fair value of the Boots reporting unit, within the Retail Pharmacy International segment, is in excess of its carrying value by approximately 11% . The Company will continue to monitor the UK industry and market trends and the impact it may have on the Boots reporting unit. The determination of the fair value of the reporting units requires the Company to make significant estimates and assumptions. Although the Company believes its estimates of fair value are reasonable, actual financial results could differ from those estimates due to the inherent uncertainty involved in making such estimates. Changes in assumptions concerning future financial results or other underlying assumptions could have a significant impact on either the fair value of the reporting units, the amount of the goodwill impairment charge, or both.

As of August 31, 2018 , there were no borrowings outstanding under the February 2017 Revolving Credit Agreement. $6.0 billion note issuance On June 1, 2016, Walgreens Boots Alliance received net proceeds of $6.0 billion from a public offering of five series of U.S. dollar notes with varying maturities and interest rates. Because the merger with Rite Aid was not consummated on or prior to June 1, 2017, the 2018 notes, the 2021 notes and the 2023 notes were redeemed on June 5, 2017 under the special mandatory redemption terms of the indenture governing such notes. Walgreens Boots Alliance was required to redeem all of the 2018 - 80 - notes, the 2021 notes and the 2023 notes then outstanding, at a special mandatory redemption price equal to 101% of the aggregate principal amount of such notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest of approximately $1 million to, but excluding, the date of redemption.

From time to time, the Company uses forward starting interest rates swaps to hedge its interest rate exposure of some of its anticipated debt issuance. The Company utilizes foreign currency forward contracts and other foreign currency derivatives to hedge significant committed and highly probable future transactions and cash flows denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the Company or its subsidiaries. The Company has significant non-US dollar denominated net investments and uses foreign currency denominated financial instruments, specifically foreign currency derivatives and foreign currency denominated debt, to hedge its foreign currency risk. Fair value hedges The Company holds an interest rate swap converting $250 million of its 5.250% fixed rate notes to a floating interest rate based on the six-month LIBOR in arrears plus a constant spread. All swap termination dates coincide with the notes maturity date, January 15, 2019. These swaps were designated as fair value hedges. The gains and losses due to changes in fair value on the swaps and on the hedged notes attributable to interest rate risk did not have a material impact on the Companys Financial Statements. The changes in fair value of the Companys debt that was - 81 - swapped from fixed to variable rate and designated as fair value hedges are included in long-term debt on the Consolidated Balance Sheets (see note 7 , debt ). No material gain or losses were recorded for ineffectiveness during fiscal 2018 , 2017 , or 2016 . Derivatives not designated as hedges The Company enters into derivative transactions that are not designated as accounting hedges. These derivative instruments are economic hedges of foreign currency risks.

Derivatives credit risk Counterparties to derivative financial instruments expose the Company to credit-related losses in the event of counterparty nonperformance, and the Company regularly monitors the credit worthiness of each counterparty. Derivatives offsetting The Company does not offset the fair value amounts of derivative instruments subject to master netting agreements in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Note 9 . Fair value measurements The Company measures certain assets and liabilities in accordance with ASC Topic 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures, which defines fair value as the price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. In addition, it establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes observable and unobservable inputs used to measure fair value into three broad Levels: ##TABLE_START Level 1 - Quoted prices in active markets that are accessible at the measurement date for identical assets and liabilities. The fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to Level 1 inputs. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START Level 2 - Observable inputs other than quoted prices in active markets. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START Level 3 - Unobservable inputs for which there is little or no market data available. The fair value hierarchy gives the lowest priority to Level 3 inputs. ##TABLE_END - 82 - Assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis were as follows (in millions): ##TABLE_START   August 31, 2018  Level 1  Level 2  Level 3 Assets :         Money market funds 1  $  $  $   $  Available-for-sale investments 2       Foreign currency forwards 3       Liabilities :         Interest rate swaps 4       Foreign currency forwards 3       ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START   August 31, 2017  Level 1  Level 2  Level 3 Assets :         Money market funds 1  $ 2,096  $ 2,096  $   $  Available-for-sale investments 2       Liabilities:         Foreign currency forwards 3       ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START 1  Money market funds are valued at the closing price reported by the fund sponsor. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START 2  Fair values of quoted investments are based on bid prices as of August 31, 2018 and 2017 . ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START 3  The fair value of forward currency contracts is estimated by discounting the difference between the contractual forward price and the current available forward price for the residual maturity of the contract using observable market rates. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START 4  The fair value of interest rate swaps is calculated by discounting the estimated future cash flows based on the applicable observable yield curves. See note 8 , financial instruments , for additional information. ##TABLE_END There were no transfers between Levels in fiscal 2018 or 2017 . The Company reports its debt instruments under the guidance of ASC Topic 825, Financial Instruments, which requires disclosure of the fair value of the Companys debt in the footnotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Unless otherwise noted, the fair value for all notes was determined based upon quoted market prices and therefore categorized as Level 1. See note 7 , debt , for further information. The carrying values of accounts receivable and trade accounts payable approximated their respective fair values due to their short-term nature. Note 10 . Commitments and contingencies The Company is involved in legal proceedings, including litigation, arbitration and other claims, and investigations, inspections, audits, claims, inquiries and similar actions by pharmacy, healthcare, tax and other governmental authorities, arising in the normal course of the Companys business, including the matters described below. Legal proceedings, in general, and securities, class action and multi-district litigation, in particular, can be expensive and disruptive. Some of these suits may purport or may be determined to be class actions and/or involve parties seeking large and/or indeterminate amounts, including punitive or exemplary damages, and may remain unresolved for several years. The Company also may be named from time to time in qui tam actions initiated by private third parties. In such actions, the private parties purport to act on behalf of federal or state governments, allege that false claims have been submitted for payment by the government and may receive an award if their claims are successful. After a private party has filed a qui tam action, the government must investigate the private party's claim and determine whether to intervene in and take control over the litigation. These actions may remain under seal while the government makes this determination. If the government declines to intervene, the private party may nonetheless continue to pursue the litigation on his or her own purporting to act on behalf of the government. From time to time, the Company is also involved in legal proceedings as a plaintiff involving antitrust, tax, contract, intellectual property and other matters. Gain contingencies, if any, are recognized when they are realized. The results of legal proceedings are often uncertain and difficult to predict, and the costs incurred in litigation can be substantial, regardless of the outcome. With respect to litigation and other legal proceedings where the Company has determined that a loss is reasonably possible, the Company is unable to estimate the amount or range of reasonably possible loss due to the inherent difficulty of predicting the outcome of and uncertainties regarding such litigation and legal proceedings. The Company believes that its defenses and assertions in pending legal proceedings have merit, and does not believe that any of these pending matters, after consideration of applicable reserves and rights to indemnification, will have a material adverse effect on the Companys consolidated financial position. However, substantial unanticipated verdicts, fines and rulings do - 83 - sometimes occur. As a result, the Company could from time to time incur judgments, enter into settlements or revise its expectations regarding the outcome of certain matters, and such developments could have a material adverse effect on its results of operations in the period in which the amounts are accrued and/or its cash flows in the period in which the amounts are paid. On December 29, 2014, a putative shareholder filed a derivative action in federal court in the Northern District of Illinois against certain current and former directors and officers of Walgreen Co., and Walgreen Co. as a nominal defendant, arising out of certain public statements the Company made regarding its former fiscal 2016 goals. The action asserts claims for breach of fiduciary duty, waste and unjust enrichment. On April 10, 2015, the defendants filed a motion to dismiss. On May 18, 2015, the case was stayed in light of a securities class action that was filed on April 10, 2015. After a ruling issued on September 30, 2016 in the securities class action, which is described below, on November 3, 2016, the Court entered a stipulation and order extending the stay until the securities case is fully resolved. On April 10, 2015, a putative shareholder filed a securities class action in federal court in the Northern District of Illinois against Walgreen Co. and certain former officers of Walgreen Co. The action asserts claims for violation of the federal securities laws arising out of certain public statements the Company made regarding its former fiscal 2016 goals. On June 16, 2015, the Court entered an order appointing a lead plaintiff. Pursuant to the Courts order, lead plaintiff filed an amended complaint on August 17, 2015, and defendants moved to dismiss the amended complaint on October 16, 2015. On September 30, 2016, the Court issued an order granting in part and denying in part defendants motion to dismiss. Defendants filed their answer to the amended complaint on November 4, 2016 and filed an amended answer on January 16, 2017. Plaintiff filed its motion for class certification on April 21, 2017. The Court granted plaintiffs motion on March 29, 2018 and merits discovery is proceeding. As of August 31, 2017, the Company was aware of two putative class action lawsuits filed by purported Rite Aid stockholders against Rite Aid and its board of directors, Walgreens Boots Alliance and Victoria Merger Sub, Inc. for claims arising out of the transactions contemplated by the original Merger Agreement (prior to its amendment on January 29, 2017) (such transactions, the Rite Aid Transactions). One Rite Aid action was filed in the State of Pennsylvania in the Court of Common Pleas of Cumberland County (the Pennsylvania action), and one action was filed in the United States District Court for the Middle District of Pennsylvania (the federal action). The Pennsylvania action primarily alleged that the Rite Aid board of directors breached its fiduciary duties in connection with the Rite Aid Transactions by, among other things, agreeing to an unfair and inadequate price, agreeing to deal protection devices that preclude other bidders from making successful competing offers for Rite Aid, and failing to disclose all allegedly material information concerning the proposed merger, and also alleged that Walgreens Boots Alliance and Victoria Merger Sub, Inc. aided and abetted these alleged breaches of fiduciary duty. There has been no activity in this lawsuit since the complaint was filed. The federal action alleged, among other things, that Rite Aid and its board of directors disseminated an allegedly false and misleading proxy statement in connection with the Rite Aid Transactions. The plaintiffs in the federal action also filed a motion for preliminary injunction seeking to enjoin the Rite Aid shareholder vote relating to the Rite Aid Transactions. That motion was denied, and the matter was stayed. On March 17, 2017, plaintiffs moved to lift the stay to allow plaintiffs to file an amended complaint. That motion was granted, and plaintiffs filed their amended complaint on December 11, 2017, alleging that the Company and certain of its officers made false or misleading statements regarding the Rite Aid Transactions. On July 11, 2018, the Court denied the Companys motion to dismiss, but narrowed the time scope of the subject statements. The Company filed an answer and affirmative defenses on August 8, 2018, and on August 24, 2018 filed a new motion to dismiss based on the named plaintiffs lack of standing. The Company was also named as a defendant in eight putative class action lawsuits filed in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware (the Delaware actions). Those actions were consolidated, and plaintiffs filed a motion for preliminary injunction seeking to enjoin the Rite Aid shareholder vote relating to the Rite Aid Transactions. That motion was denied and the plaintiffs in the Delaware actions agreed to settle this matter for an immaterial amount. The Delaware actions all have been dismissed. In December 2017, the United States Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation consolidated numerous cases filed against an array of defendants by various plaintiffs such as counties, cities, hospitals, Indian tribes and others, alleging claims generally concerning the impacts of widespread opioid abuse. The consolidated multidistrict litigation, captioned In re National Prescription Opiate Litigation (MDL No. 2804), is pending in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Ohio. The Company is named as a defendant in a subset of the cases included in this multidistrict litigation. The Company also has been named as a defendant in several lawsuits brought in state courts relating to opioid matters. The relief sought by various plaintiffs is compensatory and punitive damages, as well as injunctive relief. Additionally, the Company has received from the Attorney Generals of several states subpoenas, civil investigative demands, and/or other requests concerning opioid matters. On September 28, 2018, the Company announced that it had reached an agreement with the SEC to fully resolve an investigation into certain forward-looking financial goals and related disclosures by Walgreens. The disclosures at issue were - 84 - made prior to the strategic combination with Alliance Boots and the merger pursuant to which Walgreens Boots Alliance became the parent holding company on December 31, 2014. The settlement does not involve any of the Companys current officers or executives, nor does it allege intentional or reckless conduct by the Company. In agreeing to the settlement, the Company neither admitted nor denied the SECs allegations. Pursuant to the agreement with the SEC, the Company consented to the SECs issuance of an administrative order, and the Company paid a $34.5 million penalty, which was fully reserved for in the Companys Consolidated Financial Statements as of August 31, 2018. The Company has been responding to a civil investigation involving allegations under the False Claims Act by a United States Attorneys Office, working in conjunction with several states, regarding certain dispensing practices. The Company believes it has meritorious defenses against any action that might be brought against it. The Company is cooperating with this investigation, has entered into discussions with the government concerning a potential resolution of the matter, and has established reserves in relation to such a potential resolution. Note 11 . Income taxes U.S. tax law changes The United States government enacted comprehensive tax legislation in December 2017. The accounting guidance on income taxes generally requires the effects of new tax legislation to be recognized in the period of enactment. The SEC issued Staff Accounting Bulletin 118 (SAB 118), which provides for a measurement period of up to one year from the enactment date for companies to complete their accounting for the U.S. tax law changes. In accordance with the SEC staff guidance, companies must reflect the income tax effects of those aspects of the U.S. tax law changes for which the accounting is complete. To the extent a companys accounting for the income tax effect of certain provisions of the U.S. tax law changes is incomplete but the Company is able to determine a reasonable estimate, a provisional estimate must be recorded in the Companys financial statements. If companies cannot determine a provisional estimate for the effects of an aspect of the U.S. tax law changes, they should continue applying the accounting guidance on income taxes on the basis of the provisions of the tax laws in effect immediately before the U.S. tax law changes were enacted. The U.S. tax law changes include broad and complex changes affecting the Companys fiscal 2018 results. Among other things, the U.S. tax law changes reduce the federal corporate tax rate from 35% to 21% effective January 1, 2018 and require companies to immediately accrue for a one-time transition tax on certain un-repatriated earnings of foreign subsidiaries, which is payable over an eight year period. The U.S. tax law changes modify the taxation of foreign earnings, repeal of the deduction for domestic production activities, limit interest deductibility and establish a global intangible low tax income (GILTI) regime. The lower corporate income tax rate of 21% became effective January 1, 2018, resulting in a U.S. statutory federal tax rate of approximately 26% for fiscal 2018 and 21% for subsequent fiscal years, which provided a benefit to the Companys fiscal 2018 tax provision of approximately $307 million . In connection with the Companys ongoing analysis of the impact of the U.S. tax law changes, which is provisional and subject to change, the Company recorded a net tax benefit of $125 million during fiscal 2018 . This provisional net tax benefit arises from a benefit of $648 million from re-measuring the Companys net U.S. deferred tax liabilities, partially offset by the Companys accrual for the transition tax and other U.S. tax law changes of $523 million . The Companys estimated accrual for transition tax and other U.S. tax law changes decreased from $679 million as at May 31, 2018 to $523 million as at August 31, 2018 due to additional foreign tax credits and refinement of the Companys estimated impact of tax law changes. Based on the effective dates of certain aspects of the U.S. tax law changes as well as estimated data required to be used in the corresponding measurement calculations, the Companys analysis of the income tax effects of the U.S. tax law changes could not be finalized as of August 31, 2018 . While the Company made reasonable estimates of the impact of the transition tax and the remeasurement of its deferred tax assets and liabilities, the final impact of the U.S. tax law changes may differ from these estimates, due to, among other things, changes in its interpretations and assumptions, technical clarifications from the U.S. Department of the Treasury and IRS and actions the Company may take. The Company expects to finalize such provisional amounts within the time period prescribed by SAB 118. The U.S. tax law changes created new rules that allow the Company to make an accounting policy election to either treat taxes due on future GILTI inclusions in taxable income as either a current period expense or reflect such inclusions related to temporary basis differences in the Companys measurement of deferred taxes. The Companys analysis of the new GILTI rules is not complete; therefore, the Company has not made a policy election regarding the tax accounting treatment of the GILTI tax. The U.S. tax law changes have the potential to change the Companys assertions with respect to whether earnings of the Companys foreign subsidiaries should remain indefinitely reinvested. The Company continues to evaluate these changes, therefore, the Company has not made any changes to its indefinite reinvestment assertions. - 85 - The components of earnings before income tax provision were (in millions): ##TABLE_START     U.S.  $ 3,292  $ 1,953  $ 2,577 NonU.S.  2,683  2,900  2,567 Total  $ 5,975  $ 4,853  $ 5,144 ##TABLE_ENDThe provision for income taxes consists of the following (in millions): ##TABLE_START     Current provision       Federal  $  $  $ State    NonU.S.      1,322  1,194  1,426 Deferred provision       Federal  tax law change  (648 )     Federal  excluding tax law change   (306 )  (183 ) State   (24 )  NonU.S.  tax law change    (80 )  (182 ) NonU.S.  excluding tax law change  (58 )  (24 )  (70 )   (324 )  (434 )  (429 ) Income tax provision  $  $  $ ##TABLE_END The difference between the statutory federal income tax rate and the effective tax rate is as follows: ##TABLE_START     Federal statutory rate  25.7 %  35.0 %  35.0 % State income taxes, net of federal benefit  2.3  0.3  0.8 Foreign income taxed at non-U.S. rates  (12.2 )  (11.8 )  (7.8 ) Non-taxable income  (5.2 )  (5.3 )  (4.4 ) Non-deductible expenses  2.1  1.5  1.1 Transition tax  12.4     Tax law changes  (10.9 )  (1.6 )  (3.5 ) Change in valuation allowance  8.7  0.7  1.7 Tax credits  (6.9 )  (2.9 )  (1.5 ) Other  0.7  (0.2 )  (2.0 ) Effective income tax rate  16.7 %  15.7 %  19.4 % ##TABLE_ENDThe deferred tax assets and liabilities included in the Consolidated Balance Sheets consist of the following (in millions): - 86 - ##TABLE_START    Deferred tax assets:     Postretirement benefits  $   $ Compensation and benefits   Insurance   Accrued rent   Outside basis difference    Allowance for doubtful accounts   Tax attributes  2,351  Stock compensation   Deferred income   Other     3,073  1,670 Less: valuation allowance  2,226  Total deferred tax assets   1,262 Deferred tax liabilities:     Accelerated depreciation   Inventory   Intangible assets  1,234  1,277 Equity method investment   1,002   2,597  3,536 Net deferred tax liabilities  $ 1,750  $ 2,274 ##TABLE_ENDAs of August 31, 2018 , the Company has recorded deferred tax assets for tax attributes of $2.4 billion , primarily reflecting the benefit of $426 million in U.S. federal, $43 million in state and $8.5 billion in non-U.S. ordinary and capital losses. In addition, these deferred tax assets include $58 million of income tax credits. Of these deferred tax assets, $2.1 billion will expire at various dates from 2019 through 2035. The residual deferred tax assets of $227 million have no expiry date. The Company believes it is more likely than not that the benefit from certain deferred tax assets will not be realized. In recognition of this risk, the Company has recorded a valuation allowance of $2.2 billion against those deferred tax assets as of August 31, 2018 . Income taxes paid, net of refunds were $0.6 billion , $1.1 billion and $1.1 billion for fiscal years 2018 , 2017 and 2016 , respectively. ASC Topic 740, Income Taxes, provides guidance regarding the recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure in the financial statement of tax positions taken or expected to be taken on a tax return, including the decision whether to file in a particular jurisdiction. As of August 31, 2018 , unrecognized tax benefits of $482 million were reported as long-term liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets while $61 million were reported as current tax liabilities. Both of these amounts include interest and penalties, when applicable. The following table provides a reconciliation of the total amounts of unrecognized tax benefits (in millions): ##TABLE_START     Balance at beginning of year  $  $  $ Gross increases related to tax positions in a prior period    Gross decreases related to tax positions in a prior period  (15 )  (36 )  (47 ) Gross increases related to tax positions in the current period    Settlements with taxing authorities  (87 )  (2 )  (17 ) Currency    (1 )  (11 ) Lapse of statute of limitations  (3 )  (5 )  (6 ) Balance at end of year  $  $  $ ##TABLE_END- 87 - At August 31, 2018 , 2017 and 2016 , $331 million , $286 million and $237 million , respectively, of unrecognized tax benefits would favorably impact the effective tax rate if recognized. During the next twelve months, based on current knowledge, it is reasonably possible the amount of unrecognized tax benefits could decrease by up to $24 million due to anticipated tax audit settlements and the expirations of statutes of limitations associated with tax positions related to multiple tax jurisdictions. The Company recognizes interest and penalties in the income tax provision in its Consolidated Statements of Earnings. At August 31, 2018 and August 31, 2017 , the Company had accrued interest and penalties of $87 million and $43 million , respectively. For the year ended August 31, 2018 , the amount reported in income tax expense related to interest and penalties was $44 million .  The Company files a consolidated U.S. federal income tax return as well as income tax returns in various states and multiple foreign jurisdictions. It is generally no longer under audit examinations for U.S. federal income tax purposes for any years prior to fiscal 2014. With few exceptions, it is no longer subject to state and local income tax examinations by tax authorities for years before fiscal 2007. In foreign tax jurisdictions, the Company is generally no longer subject to examination by the tax authorities in Luxembourg prior to 2013, in Germany prior to 2014, in France prior to 2008 and in Turkey prior to 2014. With respect to the United Kingdom, a number of specific issues remain open to examination by the tax authorities back to 2000.  The Company has received tax holidays from Swiss cantonal income taxes relative to certain of its Swiss operations. The income tax holidays are expected to extend through September 2022. The holidays had a beneficial impact of $127 million and $142 million during fiscal 2018 and 2017 , respectively. This benefit is primarily included as part of the foreign income taxed at non-U.S. rates line in the effective tax rate reconciliation table above. At August 31, 2018 , it is not practicable for the Company to determine the amount of the unrecognized deferred tax liability it has with respect to temporary differences related to investments in foreign subsidiaries and foreign corporate joint ventures that are essentially permanent in duration. Note 12 . Stock compensation plans The Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. Omnibus Incentive Plan (the Omnibus Plan) which became effective in fiscal 2013, provides for incentive compensation to the Companys non-employee directors, officers and employees and consolidates several previously existing equity compensation plans into a single plan. The Company grants stock options, performance shares and restricted units under the Omnibus Plan. Performance shares issued under the Omnibus Plan offer performance-based incentive awards and equity-based awards to key employees. The fair value of each performance share granted assumes that performance goals will be achieved at 100 percent . If such goals are not met, no compensation expense is recognized and any recognized compensation expense is reversed. Restricted stock units are also equity-based awards with performance requirements that are granted to key employees. The performance shares and restricted stock unit awards are both subject to restrictions as to continuous employment except in the case of death, normal retirement or total and permanent disability.  Total stock-based compensation expense for fiscal 2018 , 2017 and 2016 was $130 million , $91 million and $115 million , respectively. The recognized tax benefit was $43 million , $78 million and $21 million for fiscal 2018 , 2017 and 2016 , respectively. Unrecognized compensation cost related to non-vested awards at August 31, 2018 was $147 million , which will be recognized over three years . Note 13 . Retirement benefits The Company sponsors several retirement plans, including defined benefit plans, defined contribution plans and a postretirement health plan. Defined benefit pension plans (non-U.S. plans) The Company has various defined benefit pension plans outside the United States. The principal defined benefit pension plan is the Boots Pension Plan (the Boots Plan), which covers certain employees in the United Kingdom. The Boots Plan is a funded final salary defined benefit plan providing pensions and death benefits to members. The Boots Plan was closed to future accrual effective July 1, 2010, with pensions calculated based on salaries up until that date. The Boots Plan is governed by a trustee board, which is independent of the Company. The plan is subject to a full funding actuarial valuation on a triennial basis. The investment strategy of the principal defined benefit pension plan is to hold approximately 85% of its assets in a diverse portfolio which aims to broadly match the characteristics of the plans liabilities by investing in bonds, derivatives and other fixed income assets, with the remainder invested in predominantly return-seeking assets. Interest rate and inflation rate swaps are also employed to complement the role of fixed and index-linked bond holdings in liability risk management. - 88 - The following tables present classes of defined benefit pension plan assets by fair value hierarchy (in millions): ##TABLE_START   August 31, 2018  Level 1  Level 2  Level 3 Equity securities :         Equity securities 1  $ 1,030  $   $ 1,030  $           Debt securities:         Fixed interest government bonds 2       Index linked government bonds 2  2,880    2,880   Corporate bonds 3  2,542    2,536           Real estate:         Real estate 4                Other :         Other investments 5              Total  $ 8,676  $  $ 7,878  $ ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START   August 31, 2017  Level 1  Level 2  Level 3 Equity securities :         Equity securities 1  $  $   $  $           Debt securities:         Fixed interest government bonds 2       Index linked government bonds 2  3,354    3,354   Corporate bonds 3  3,251    3,251            Real estate:         Real estate 4                Other :         Other investments 5              Total  $ 8,980  $  $ 8,361  $ ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START 1  Equity securities, which mainly comprise investments in commingled funds, are valued based on quoted prices and are primarily exchange-traded. Securities for which official close or last trade pricing on an active exchange is available are classified as Level 1 investments. If closing prices are not available, or the investments are in a commingled fund, ##TABLE_END securities are valued at the last quoted bid price and typically are categorized as Level 2 investments. ##TABLE_START 2  Debt securities: government bonds comprise fixed interest and index linked bonds issued by central governments and are valued based on quotes received from independent pricing services or from dealers who make markets in such securities. Pricing services utilize pricing which considers readily available inputs such as the yield or price of bonds of comparable quality, coupon, maturity and type, as well as dealer-supplied prices. Government bonds are classified as Level 2 investments. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START 3  Debt securities: corporate bonds comprise bonds issued by corporations in both segregated and commingled funds ##TABLE_END and are valued using recently executed transactions, or quoted market prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets, or for identical assets and liabilities in markets that are not active. If there have been no market transactions in a particular fixed income security, its fair value is calculated by pricing models that benchmark the security against other securities with actual market prices. Corporate bonds are categorized as Level 2 investments. ##TABLE_START 4  Real estate comprises investments in certain property funds which are valued based on the underlying properties. These properties are valued using a number of standard industry techniques such as cost, discounted cash flows, independent appraisals and market based comparable data. Real estate investments are categorized as Level 3 investments. Changes in ##TABLE_END- 89 - Level 3 investments during fiscal 2018 were driven by actual return on plan assets still held at August 31, 2018 and purchases during the year. ##TABLE_START 5  Other investments mainly comprise cash and cash equivalents, derivatives and direct private placements. Cash is categorized as a Level 1 investment and cash in commingled funds is categorized as Level 2 investments. Cash equivalents are valued using observable yield curves, discounting and interest rates and are categorized as Level 2 investments. Derivatives which are exchange-traded and for which market quotations are readily available are valued at the last reported sale price or official closing price as reported by an independent pricing service on the primary market, or exchange on which they are traded, and are categorized as Level 1 investments. Over-the-counter derivatives typically are valued by independent pricing services and are categorized as Level 2 investments. Direct private placements are typically bonds valued by reference to comparable bonds and are categorized as Level 3 investments. Changes in Level 3 investments during fiscal 2018 were primarily driven by purchases during the year. ##TABLE_END Components of net periodic pension costs for the defined benefit pension plans (in millions): ##TABLE_START   Boots and other pension plans     Service costs  $  $  $ Interest costs    Expected returns on plan assets/other  (209 )  (146 )  (249 ) Total net periodic pension (income) cost  $ (11 )  $  $ ##TABLE_ENDChange in benefit obligations for the defined benefit pension plans (in millions): ##TABLE_START    Benefit obligation at beginning of year  $ 8,880  $ 9,463 Service costs   Interest costs   Amendments/other  (4 )  (11 ) Net actuarial gain  (466 )  (295 ) Benefits paid  (398 )  (298 ) Currency translation adjustments   (158 ) Benefit obligation at end of year  $ 8,293  $ 8,880 ##TABLE_ENDChange in plan assets for the defined benefit pension plans (in millions): ##TABLE_START    Plan assets at fair value at beginning of year  $ 8,980  $ 9,428 Employer contributions   Benefits paid  (398 )  (298 ) Return on assets/other  (55 )  (52 ) Currency translation adjustments   (168 ) Plan assets at fair value at end of year  $ 8,676  $ 8,980 ##TABLE_END Amounts recognized in the Consolidated Balance Sheets (in millions): ##TABLE_START    Other non-current assets  $  $ Accrued expenses and other liabilities  (7 )  (7 ) Other non-current liabilities  (164 )  (171 ) Net asset (liability) recognized at end of year  $  $ ##TABLE_END Cumulative pre-tax amounts recognized in accumulated other comprehensive (income) loss (in millions): - 90 - ##TABLE_START    Net actuarial (gain) loss  $ (27 )  $ ##TABLE_END The projected benefit obligation, accumulated benefit obligation and fair value of plan assets for all pension plans, including accumulated benefit obligations in excess of plan assets, at August 31 were as follows (in millions): ##TABLE_START    Projected benefit obligation  $ 8,293  $ 8,880 Accumulated benefit obligation  8,285  8,861 Fair value of plan assets  8,676  8,980 ##TABLE_ENDEstimated future benefit payments for the next 10 years from defined benefit pension plans to participants are as follows (in millions): ##TABLE_START  Estimated future benefit payments $ 2020 2021 2022 2023 2024-2028 1,699 ##TABLE_END The assumptions used in accounting for the defined benefit pension plans were as follows: ##TABLE_START    Weighted-average assumptions used to determine benefit obligations     Discount rate  2.67 %  2.41 % Rate of compensation increase  2.68 %  2.83 %      Weighted-average assumptions used to determine net periodic benefit cost     Discount rate  2.12 %  2.16 % Expected long-term return on plan assets  2.27 %  1.69 % Rate of compensation increase  2.64 %  2.44 % ##TABLE_ENDBased on current actuarial estimates, the Company plans to make contributions of $29 million to its defined benefit pension plans in fiscal 2019 and expects to make contributions beyond 2019 , which will vary based upon many factors, including the performance of the defined benefit pension plan assets. Defined contribution plans The principal retirement plan for U.S. employees is the Walgreen Profit-Sharing Retirement Trust, to which both the Company and participating employees contribute. The Companys contribution is in the form of a guaranteed match which is approved annually by the Walgreen Co. Board of Directors and reviewed by the Compensation Committee and Finance Committee of the Walgreens Boots Alliance Board of Directors. The profit-sharing provision was an expense of $217 million , $221 million and $226 million in fiscal 2018 , 2017 and 2016 , respectively. The Companys contributions were $366 million , $ 220 million and $ 225 million in fiscal 2018 , 2017 and 2016 , respectively. The Company also has certain contract based defined contribution arrangements. The principal one is the Alliance Healthcare  Boots Retirement Savings Plan, which is United Kingdom based and to which both the Company and participating employees contribute. The cost recognized in the Consolidated Statement of Earnings was $142 million in fiscal 2018 , $112 million in fiscal 2017 and $130 million in fiscal 2016 .  Postretirement healthcare plan - 91 - The Company provides certain health insurance benefits to retired U.S. employees who meet eligibility requirements, including age, years of service and date of hire. The costs of these benefits are accrued over the service life of the employee. An amendment to this plan during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018 resulted in a reduction in the benefit plan obligation of $201 million and the recognition of a curtailment gain of $112 million . An amendment during the third quarter of fiscal 2017 resulted in the recognition of a curtailment gain of $109 million . The Companys postretirement health benefit plan obligation was $146 million and $361 million in fiscal 2018 and 2017 respectively and is not funded. The expected benefit to be paid net of the estimated federal subsidy during fiscal year 2019 is $11 million . Note 14 . Capital stock In connection with the Companys capital policy, the Board of Directors has authorized share repurchase programs. In April 2017, Walgreens Boots Alliance authorized a stock repurchase program (the April 2017 stock repurchase program), which authorized the repurchase of up to $1.0 billion of Walgreens Boots Alliance common stock prior to the programs expiration on December 31, 2017. In May 2017, the Company completed the April 2017 stock repurchase program, purchasing 11.8 million shares. In June 2017, Walgreens Boots Alliance authorized a new stock repurchase program, which authorized the repurchase of up to $5.0 billion of Walgreens Boots Alliance common stock prior to the programs expiration on August 31, 2018, which authorization was increased by an additional $1.0 billion in October 2017 (as expanded, the June 2017 stock repurchase program). The June 2017 stock repurchase program was completed in October 2017. In June 2018, Walgreens Boots Alliance authorized a new stock repurchase program, which authorized the repurchase of up to $10.0 billion of Walgreens Boots Alliance common stock, which program has no specified expiration date. The Company purchased 72 million and 59 million shares under stock repurchase programs in fiscal 2018 and 2017 at a cost of $4.9 billion and $4.8 billion , respectively. The Company determines the timing and amount of repurchases based on its assessment of various factors including prevailing market conditions, alternate uses of capital, liquidity, the economic environment and other factors. The timing and amount of these purchases may change at any time and from time to time. The Company has repurchased, and may from time to time in the future repurchase, shares on the open market through Rule 10b5-1 plans, which enable a company to repurchase shares at times when it otherwise might be precluded from doing so under insider trading laws. In addition, the Company continued to repurchase shares to support the needs of the employee stock plans. Shares totaling $289 million were purchased to support the needs of the employee stock plans during fiscal 2018 as compared to $457 million and $1 billion in fiscal 2017 and fiscal 2016 , respectively. At August 31, 2018 , 33 million shares of common stock were reserved for future issuances under the Companys various employee benefit plans. - 92 - Note 15 .

See note 13 , retirement benefits . ##TABLE_END Note 16 . Segment reporting The Company has aligned its operations into three reportable segments: Retail Pharmacy USA, Retail Pharmacy International and Pharmaceutical Wholesale. The operating segments have been identified based on the financial data utilized by the Companys Chief Executive Officer (the chief operating decision maker) to assess segment performance and allocate resources among the Companys operating segments. The chief operating decision maker uses adjusted operating income to assess segment profitability. The chief operating decision maker does not use total assets by segment to make decisions regarding resources, therefore the total asset disclosure by segment has not been included. ##TABLE_START  The Retail Pharmacy USA segment consists of the Walgreens business, which includes the operation of retail drugstores, convenient care clinics and mail and central specialty pharmacy services. Sales for the segment are principally derived from the sale of prescription drugs and a wide assortment of retail products, including health and wellness, beauty and personal care and consumables and general merchandise. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  The Retail Pharmacy International segment consists of pharmacy-led health and beauty retail businesses and optical practices. These businesses include Boots branded stores in the United Kingdom, Thailand, Norway, the Republic of Ireland and the Netherlands, Benavides in Mexico and Ahumada in Chile. Sales for the segment are principally derived from the sale of prescription drugs and health and wellness, beauty and personal care and other consumer products. ##TABLE_END- 93 - ##TABLE_START  The Pharmaceutical Wholesale segment consists of the Alliance Healthcare pharmaceutical wholesaling and distribution businesses and an equity method investment in AmerisourceBergen. Wholesale operations are located in the United Kingdom, Germany, France, Turkey, Spain, the Netherlands, Egypt, Norway, Romania, Czech Republic and Lithuania. Sales for the segment are principally derived from the wholesaling and distribution of a comprehensive offering of brand-name pharmaceuticals (including specialty pharmaceutical products) and generic pharmaceuticals, health and beauty products, home healthcare supplies and equipment and related services to pharmacies and other healthcare providers. ##TABLE_END The results of operations for each reportable segment includes procurement benefits and an allocation of corporate-related overhead costs. The Eliminations column contains items not allocable to the reportable segments, as the information is not utilized by the chief operating decision maker to assess segment performance and allocate resources.

Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the framework in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). As permitted by the SEC, our assessment of internal controls over financial reporting excludes internal control over financial reporting of equity method investees. However, our assessment of internal control over financial reporting with respect to equity method investees did include controls over the recording of amounts related to our investment that are recorded in the Consolidated Financial Statements, including controls over the selection of accounting methods for our investments, the recognition of equity method earnings and losses and the determination, valuation and recording of our investment account balances. Additionally, the scope of managements evaluation of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting did not include the internal control over financial reporting of the acquisition of certain Rite Aid assets (Rite Aid) as described in note 2 , acquisitions , to the Consolidated Financial Statements. This exclusion is in accordance with the SEC Staffs general guidance that an assessment of a business may be omitted from managements report on internal control over financial reporting for one year following the acquisition. The recognition of goodwill and intangible assets, however, is covered by our internal controls over mergers and acquisitions, which were included in management's assessment of the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of August 31, 2018. The acquisition of certain Rite Aid assets represented approximately 4% of the Companys total assets as of August 31, 2018 after excluding goodwill and intangible assets recorded and 4% of the Companys net sales for the year ended August 31, 2018. Based on our evaluation, management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of August 31, 2018 . Deloitte  Touche LLP, the Companys independent registered public accounting firm, has audited our internal control over financial reporting, as stated in its report which is included herein.  ##TABLE_START /s/ Stefano Pessina  /s/ James Kehoe   Stefano Pessina   James Kehoe   Executive Vice Chairman and Chief Executive Officer   Executive Vice President and Global Chief Financial Officer  ##TABLE_ENDOctober 11, 2018 - 98 - REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc.

In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of August 31, 2018 and 2017, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended August 31, 2018, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of August 31, 2018, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated October 11, 2018, expressed an unqualified opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting. Basis for Opinion These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. /s/ DELOITTE  TOUCHE LLP Chicago, Illinois October 11, 2018  We have served as the Company's auditor since 2002. - 99 - REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM  To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. Opinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting We have audited the internal control over financial reporting of Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. and subsidiaries (the Company) as of August 31, 2018, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of August 31, 2018, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by COSO. We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended August 31, 2018, of the Company and our report dated October 11, 2018, expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements. As described in Managements Report on Internal Control, management excluded from its assessment the internal control over financial reporting of certain assets acquired from Rite Aid Corporation (Rite Aid) which were acquired during the year ended August 31, 2018. The certain assets acquired from Rite Aid represented approximately 4% of the Companys total assets as of August 31, 2018 after excluding goodwill and intangible assets recorded and 4% of the Companys net sales for the year ended August 31, 2018. Accordingly, our audit did not include the internal control over financial reporting for the certain assets acquired from Rite Aid. Basis for Opinion The Companys management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Managements Report on Internal Control. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Companys internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting A companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. /s/ DELOITTE  TOUCHE LLP Chicago, Illinois October 11, 2018 - 100 - ", "9A": " Item 9A. Controls and procedures Evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures Management conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this Form 10-K. The controls evaluation was conducted under the supervision and with the participation of the Companys management, including its Chief Executive Officer (CEO) and Chief Financial Officer (CFO). As of the end of the period covered by this report, the Company had acquired 1,932 stores from Rite Aid. The scope of management's assessment of the effectiveness of the Company's disclosure controls and procedures did not include the internal controls over financial reporting of the acquired Rite Aid stores. This exclusion is in accordance with the SEC staff's general guidance that an assessment of a recently acquired business may be omitted from the scope of management's assessment for one year following the acquisition. The recognition of goodwill and intangible assets, however, is covered by our internal controls over mergers and acquisitions, which were included in management's assessment of the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of August 31, 2018. Based upon the controls evaluation, our CEO and CFO have concluded that, as of the end of the period covered by this report, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in our Exchange Act reports is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified by the SEC, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to management, including the CEO and CFO, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.

Changes in internal control over financial reporting In connection with the evaluation pursuant to Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(d) of the Companys internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f)) by the Companys management, including its CEO and CFO, no changes during the quarter ended August 31, 2018 were identified that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Companys internal control over financial reporting. As a result of the acquisition of Rite Aid stores, the Company has incorporated internal controls over significant processes specific to the acquisition that it believes to be appropriate and necessary in consideration of the level of related integration. As the post-closing integration continues, the Company will continue to review such internal controls and processes and may take further steps to integrate such controls and processes with those of the Company. Inherent limitations on effectiveness of controls Our management, including the CEO and CFO, do not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent or detect all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the control systems objectives will be met. The design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Further, because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that misstatements due to error or fraud will not occur or that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the Company have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake. Controls can also be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people, or by management override of the controls. The design of any system of controls is based in part on certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. Projections of any evaluation of controls effectiveness to future periods are subject to risks. Over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or deterioration in the degree of compliance with policies or procedures. ", "9B": " Item 9B.

These strategic partnerships, initiatives and alliances are designed to complement and enhance our customer offerings. On September 19, 2017, the Company announced that it had secured regulatory clearance for an amended and restated asset purchase agreement to purchase 1,932 stores, three distribution centers and related inventory from Rite Aid Corporation (Rite Aid) for $4.375 billion in cash and other consideration. Consideration included cash of $4,157 million and the fair value of the option granted to Rite Aid to become a member of the Companys group purchasing organization, Walgreens Boots Alliance Development GmbH. The purchases of these stores occurred in waves during fiscal 2018 and have been accounted for as business combinations. The transition of the first distribution center and related inventory occurred in September 2018 and the transition of the remaining two distribution centers and related inventory remains subject to closing conditions set forth in the amended and restated asset purchase agreement. Previously, on June 28, 2017, Walgreens Boots Alliance and Rite Aid had terminated an amended agreement and plan of merger pursuant to which the Company had agreed to acquire Rite Aid. Pursuant to such termination, the Company paid Rite Aid a termination fee of $325 million. The Company also reimbursed $25 million of transaction costs of Freds, Inc. in connection with the termination of an asset purchase agreement among the Company, Rite Aid and Freds, Inc. that was subject to the completion of the acquisition of Rite Aid by the Company. The option granted to Rite Aid to become a member of the Companys group purchasing organization was terminated during fiscal 2019, resulting in recognition of a gain in other income (expense). On March 31, 2017, Walgreens Boots Alliance and pharmacy benefit manager Prime Therapeutics LLC closed a transaction to form a combined central specialty pharmacy and mail services company, AllianceRx Walgreens Prime, as part of a strategic alliance. AllianceRx Walgreens Prime is consolidated by Walgreens Boots Alliance and reported within the Retail Pharmacy USA division in its financial statements. See note 2 , acquisitions , to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information. In addition, the Company has completed additional acquisitions, divestitures and strategic initiatives in recent years designed to grow its businesses and enhance its competitive position.

Relationship with AmerisourceBergen In March 2013, Walgreens, Alliance Boots GmbH (Alliance Boots) and AmerisourceBergen Corporation (AmerisourceBergen) announced various agreements and arrangements, including a ten-year pharmaceutical distribution agreement between Walgreens and AmerisourceBergen pursuant to which the Company sources branded and generic pharmaceutical products from AmerisourceBergen in the United States and an agreement which provides AmerisourceBergen the ability to access generic pharmaceutical products through the Companys global sourcing enterprise, Walgreens Boots Alliance Development GmbH. In May 2016, certain of these agreements were extended for three years and are now expected to expire in 2026. In addition, in March 2013, Walgreens, Alliance Boots and AmerisourceBergen entered into agreements and arrangements pursuant to which the Company has the right, but not the obligation, to purchase a minority equity position in AmerisourceBergen over time through open market purchases and pursuant to warrants to acquire AmerisourceBergen common stock and gain associated representation on AmerisourceBergens Board of Directors in certain circumstances. Please refer to the Companys Form 8-K filed on March 20, 2013 for more detailed information regarding these agreements and arrangements.

For more information, see managements discussion and analysis in part II, item 7 and note 5, equity method investments and note 18, related parties to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in part II, item 8, below for additional information. Industry overview The retail pharmacy and pharmaceutical wholesale industries across the globe are highly competitive and dynamic and have experienced consolidation and an evolving competitive landscape in recent years. Prescription drugs play a significant role in healthcare and constitute a first line of treatment for many medical conditions. The Company believes the long-term outlook for prescription drug utilization is strong due, in part, to aging populations, increases in life expectancy, increases in the availability of generic drugs, the continued development of innovative drugs that improve quality of life and control healthcare costs and increases in the number of persons with insurance coverage for prescription drugs, including, in the United States, baby boomers increasingly becoming eligible for the federally funded Medicare Part D prescription program. Pharmaceutical wholesalers act as a vital link between drug manufacturers and pharmacies and healthcare providers in supplying pharmaceuticals to patients. The retail pharmacy industry across the globe relies significantly on private and governmental third-party payers. Many private organizations throughout the healthcare industry, including pharmacy benefit management (PBM) companies and health insurance companies, have consolidated in recent years to create larger healthcare enterprises with greater bargaining power. Third-party payers, including the Medicare Part D plans and the state-sponsored Medicaid and related managed care Medicaid agencies in the United States, can change eligibility requirements or reduce certain reimbursement rates. In addition, in many European countries, the government provides or subsidizes healthcare to consumers and regulates pharmaceutical prices, patient eligibility and reimbursement levels to control costs for the government-sponsored healthcare system. Changes in law or regulation also can impact reimbursement rates and terms. For example, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (the ACA) was enacted to help control federal healthcare spending, including for prescription drugs, in the United States. These changes generally are expected to reduce Medicaid reimbursements in the United States. State Medicaid programs are also expected to continue to seek reductions in reimbursements. When third-party payers or governmental authorities take actions that restrict eligibility or reduce prices or reimbursement rates, sales and margins in the retail pharmacy industry could be reduced, which would adversely affect industry profitability. In some cases, these possible adverse effects may be partially or entirely offset by controlling inventory costs and other expenses, dispensing more higher margin generics, finding new revenue streams through pharmacy services or other offerings and/or dispensing a greater volume of prescriptions. These industry dynamics and challenges are continuous and have intensified in recent years. Since the completion of the strategic combination with Alliance Boots in December 2014, the Company has had a continuous focus on operational efficiencies and cost reduction. Generic prescription drugs have continued to help lower overall costs for customers and third-party payers. The Company expects the utilization of generic pharmaceuticals to continue to increase. In general, in the United States, generic versions of drugs generate lower sales dollars per prescription, but higher gross profit dollars, as compared with patent-protected brand name drugs. The impact on retail pharmacy gross profit dollars can be significant in the first several months after a generic version of a drug is first allowed to compete with the branded version, which is generally referred to as a generic conversion. In any given year, the number of major brand name drugs that undergo a conversion from branded to generic status can vary and the timing of generic conversions can be difficult to predict, which can have a significant impact on retail pharmacy sales and gross profit dollars. In general, in the United States, specialty prescription business is also growing and generates higher sales dollars per prescription, but lower gross margin, as compared to generic prescription drugs. The Company expects that market demand, government regulation, third-party reimbursement policies, government contracting requirements and other pressures will continue to cause the industries in which the Company competes to evolve. Pharmacists are on the frontlines of the healthcare delivery system, and the Company believes rising healthcare costs and the limited supply of primary care physicians present opportunities for pharmacists and retail pharmacies to play an even greater role in driving positive outcomes for patients and payers through expanded service offerings such as immunizations and other preventive care, healthcare clinics, pharmacist-led medication therapy management and chronic condition management. Segments Our operations are organized into three divisions, which are also our reportable segments:  ##TABLE_START  Retail Pharmacy USA; ##TABLE_END- 3 - ##TABLE_START  Retail Pharmacy International; and ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Pharmaceutical Wholesale. ##TABLE_END For fiscal 2019 , our segment sales were: Retail Pharmacy USA, $104.5 billion ; Retail Pharmacy International, $11.5 billion ; and Pharmaceutical Wholesale, $23.1 billion . Additional information relating to our segments is included in managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in part II, item 7 below and in note 16 , segment reporting and note 17 , sales , to our Consolidated Financial Statements included in part II, item 8 below, which information is incorporated herein by reference. Retail Pharmacy USA The Retail Pharmacy USA division (excluding equity method investments) has pharmacy-led health and beauty retail offerings in 50 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands, each focused on helping people feel happy and healthy. The Company operated 9,277 retail stores in the division as of August 31, 2019 . The principal retail pharmacy brands in the division are Walgreens and Duane Reade. The Company is a market leader in the United States and, as of August 31, 2019 , approximately 78% of the population of the United States lived within five miles of a Walgreens, Duane Reade or acquired Rite Aid retail pharmacy. The Company is focused on creating a neighborhood health destination and a more modern pharmacy aligned to a wider range of healthcare services. The Companys services help improve health outcomes for patients and manage costs for payers, including employers, managed care organizations, health systems, PBM companies and the public sector. The Company utilizes its retail network as a channel to provide health and wellness services to its customers and patients, as illustrated by the Companys ability to play a significant role in providing flu vaccines and other immunizations. Additionally, through our strategic partnership strategy, our key collaborations aim to develop new health care delivery models and to improve access to advanced healthcare technologies and solutions. We have taken further steps to develop our neighborhood health destinations, working with our strategic partners. The Company also provides specialty pharmacy and mail services and offers in-store clinics and other healthcare services throughout the United States, most of which are operated by our healthcare strategic partners. The Company has more than 88,000 healthcare service providers, including pharmacists, pharmacy technicians, nurse practitioners and other health related professionals. The division provides customers with convenient, omni-channel access to consumer goods and services, including own branded general merchandise, such as Well at Walgreens, NICE!, No7, and Soap  Glory, as well as pharmacy and health and wellness services in communities across the United States. Integrated with the Companys e-commerce platform, the Walgreens mobile application allows customers to refill prescriptions through scan technology, receive notifications when a refill is due and engage with retail functionality, such as photo and shopping features. The division is also implementing new approaches to promotions, product selection and other areas to deliver greater value to its customers in its stores, including through an enhanced beauty offering. The components of the divisions sales are Pharmacy (the sale of prescription drugs and provision of pharmacy-related services) and Retail (the sale of healthcare and retail products including non-prescription drugs, beauty, toiletries and general merchandise). The divisions sales are subject to the influence of seasonality, particularly the winter holiday and cough, cold and flu seasons. This seasonality also can affect the divisions proportion of sales between Retail and Pharmacy during certain periods. The components of the divisions fiscal year sales were as follows: ##TABLE_START   Fiscal 2019  Fiscal 2018  Fiscal 2017 Pharmacy  %  %  % Retail  %  %  % Total  %  %  % ##TABLE_ENDThe Company filled 843.7 million prescriptions (including immunizations) in the division in fiscal 2019 . Adjusted to 30-day equivalents, prescriptions filled were 1.2 billion in fiscal 2019 . Sales where reimbursement is received from managed care organizations, governmental agencies, PBM companies and private insurance were approximately 97% of the divisions fiscal 2019 Pharmacy sales. The Company fills prescriptions for many state Medicaid public assistance programs. Sales from all such Medicaid plans were approximately 4% of the divisions fiscal 2019 sales. Sales from Medicare Part D plans were approximately 20% of the divisions fiscal 2019 sales. - 4 - The Companys U.S. loyalty program, Balance Rewards, is designed to reward its most valuable customers and encourage shopping in stores and online. Balance Rewards members receive special pricing on select products and earn everyday rewards points for purchasing most merchandise that can be instantly redeemed in store or through walgreens.com. As of August 31, 2019 , the number of active Balance Rewards members totaled approximately 90 million . For this purpose, an active member is defined here as someone who has used their card in the last six months. AmerisourceBergen supplies and distributes a significant amount of generic and branded pharmaceutical products to the divisions pharmacies. The Company purchases its non-pharmaceutical merchandise from numerous manufacturers and wholesalers. The divisions sales, gross profit margin and gross profit are impacted by, among other things, both the percentage of prescriptions filled that are generic and the rate at which new generic drugs are introduced to the market. Because any number of factors outside of the Companys control can affect timing for a generic conversion, the Company faces substantial uncertainty in predicting when such conversions will occur and what effect they will have on particular future periods. The current environment of the Companys pharmacy business also includes ongoing reimbursement pressure and a shift in pharmacy mix towards 90-day at retail (one prescription that is the equivalent of three 30-day prescriptions) and Medicare Part D prescriptions. Further consolidation among generic manufacturers coupled with changes in the number of major brand name drugs anticipated to undergo a conversion from branded to generic status may also result in gross margin pressures within the industry. The Company continuously faces reimbursement pressure from PBM companies, health maintenance organizations, managed care organizations and other commercial third-party payers; agreements with these payers are regularly subject to expiration, termination or renegotiation. In addition, plan changes with rate adjustments often occur in January and the Companys reimbursement arrangements may provide for rate adjustments at prescribed intervals during their term. The Company experienced lower reimbursement rates in fiscal 2019 as compared to the same period in the prior year. The Company expects these pressures to continue. The Company has also worked to develop and expand its relationships with commercial third-party payers to enable new and/or improved market access via participation in pharmacy provider networks they offer. The prescription volume impact of new agreements and relationships typically is incremental over time. The Companys 90-day at retail prescription drug offering is typically at a lower margin than comparable 30-day prescriptions, but provides the Company with the opportunity to increase business with patients with chronic prescription needs while offering increased convenience, helping facilitate improved prescription adherence and resulting in a lower cost to fill the 90-day prescription. Similarly, the growing specialty prescription business, which generates higher sales dollars per prescription, may result in gross margin pressures within the industry, as compared to generic prescription drugs. Retail Pharmacy International The Retail Pharmacy International division (excluding equity method investments) has pharmacy-led health and beauty retail businesses in eight countries, each focused on helping people look and feel their best. The Company operated 4,605 retail stores in the division as of August 31, 2019 (see properties in part I, item 2 below for information regarding geographic coverage) and has grown its omni-channel platform, including its online presence, in recent years. The Companys principal retail pharmacy brands are Boots in the United Kingdom, Thailand, Norway, the Republic of Ireland and The Netherlands, Benavides in Mexico and Ahumada in Chile. In Europe, the Company is a market leader and its retail stores are conveniently located and its pharmacists are well placed to provide a significant role in the provision of healthcare services, working closely with other primary healthcare providers in the communities the Company serves. The Boots omni-channel offering is differentiated from that of competitors due to the product brands the Company owns, such as No7, Boots Pharmaceuticals, Liz Earle, Soap  Glory, Sleek MakeUp, Botanics and only at Boots exclusive products, together with its long established reputation for trust and customer care. The Companys brands portfolio is enhanced by its in-house product research and development capabilities. The Company has recently introduced new beauty brands and beauty halls in key locations. Certain of the product brands of the Company are also sold by third-party retailers. The Companys retail store networks are typically complemented by online platforms. In the United Kingdom, through the boots.com website and integrated mobile application, the order and collect service allows customers to order from a range of over 33,000 products by 8:00 p.m. and collect from noon the following day from approximately 97% of the United Kingdoms retail stores as of August 31, 2019 . - 5 - The Boots Advantage Card loyalty program, where customers earn points on purchases for redemption at a later date, continues to be a key element of the Boots offering. As of August 31, 2019 , the number of active Boots Advantage Card members totaled approximately 15 million . For this purpose, an active member is defined as someone who has used their card in the last six months. In addition, Boots in the United Kingdom is one of the leaders in the optical market with 606 practices, of which 165 operated on a franchise basis as of August 31, 2019 . Approximately 30% of these optical practices are located in Boots stores with the balance being standalone optical practices. The components of the divisions sales are Pharmacy (typically the sale of prescription drugs and provision of pharmacy-related services, subject to variation in particular jurisdictions depending upon regulatory and other factors) and Retail (primarily the sale of health and beauty products including beauty, toiletries and lifestyle merchandising, non-prescription drugs and, in the United Kingdom, the provision of optical services). The divisions sales are subject to the influence of seasonality, with the second fiscal quarter typically the strongest as a result of the winter holiday period. This seasonality affects the divisions proportion of sales between Retail and Pharmacy during certain periods. The components of the divisions fiscal year sales were as follows: ##TABLE_START   Fiscal 2019  Fiscal 2018  Fiscal 2017 Pharmacy  %  %  % Retail  %  %  % Total  %  %  % ##TABLE_ENDThe divisions Retail sales, gross profit margin and gross profit dollars are impacted by, among other things, the highly competitive nature of the health and beauty category, specifically the Company and its competitors pricing actions, promotional offers and events and the customers desire for value and convenience. The divisions Pharmacy sales, gross margin and gross profit dollars are impacted by governmental agencies and other third-party payers seeking to minimize increases in the costs of healthcare, including pharmaceutical drug reimbursement rates. In the United Kingdom, which is the divisions largest market for Pharmacy sales, the amount of government funding available for pharmacy services is typically reviewed and agreed with the pharmacy industry on an annual basis. In addition, performance as measured in U.S. dollars is impacted by the exchange rates used to translate these amounts into U.S. dollars, the exchange rate of British pound sterling being the most significant. The divisions performance and relevant exchange rates are also impacted by the current geopolitical environment, including the political uncertainty in the United Kingdom surrounding Brexit. For more information relating to this topic, see Risk Factors - Our substantial international business operations subject us to a number of operating, economic, political, regulatory and other international business risks. Pharmaceutical Wholesale The Pharmaceutical Wholesale division consists of the Alliance Healthcare pharmaceutical wholesaling and distribution businesses and an equity method investment in AmerisourceBergen. The Pharmaceutical Wholesale division (excluding equity method investments), which mainly operates under the Alliance Healthcare brand, supplies medicines, other healthcare products and related services to more than 115,000 pharmacies, doctors, health centers and hospitals each year from 300 distribution centers in 11 countries, primarily in Europe, as of August 31,  2019 . The distribution of prescription medicines to pharmacists comprises the vast majority of the divisions sales. The wholesale businesses seek to provide high core service levels to pharmacists in terms of frequency of delivery, product availability, delivery accuracy, timeliness and reliability at competitive prices. The Company also offers customers innovative added-value services to help pharmacists develop their own businesses. This includes membership of Alphega Pharmacy, the Companys pan-European network for independent pharmacies, which, as of August 31, 2019 , had over 6,800 members. In addition to the wholesale of medicines and other healthcare products, the divisions businesses provide services to pharmaceutical manufacturers which are increasingly seeking to gain greater control over their product distribution, while at the same time outsourcing non-core activities. These services include pre-wholesale and contract logistics (mainly under the - 6 - Alloga brand), direct deliveries to pharmacies and innovative and specialized healthcare services, covering clinical homecare, medicine support, dispensing services, medicine preparation and clinical trial support (mainly under the Alcura brand). Combined with local engagement, scale is important in pharmaceutical wholesaling. Walgreens Boots Alliance is one of the largest pharmaceutical wholesalers and distributors in Europe, and it ranks as one of the top three in market share in many of the individual countries in which it operates. The divisions sales, gross profit margin and gross profit dollars are impacted by, among other things, government actions, which typically seek to reduce the growth in prescription drug consumption, reduce reimbursement rates and increase generic drug utilization. A greater proportion of generic drugs, whether as a result of government actions, generic conversions or other factors, typically has an adverse effect on the Companys revenues. However, in the wholesale division, the Company typically earns equal or better gross margins on generic drugs than on branded drugs, although there are exceptions. Changes in manufacturers product distribution business models can also impact the divisions sales and gross margin. For example, when pharmaceutical drug manufacturers introduce fee-for-service contracts, the Companys sales are reduced even if it is successful in winning these contracts, as the Company only recognizes sales for the amount of the fees charged. Other manufacturer services, including pre-wholesale and contract logistics operations, are typically on a fee-for-service basis. In addition, performance as measured in U.S. dollars is impacted by the exchange rates used to translate these amounts into U.S. dollars, the exchange rate of British pound sterling and the Euro being the most significant. The divisions sales are subject to less seasonality than the Companys other divisions. The divisions performance and relevant exchange rates are also impacted by the current geopolitical environment, including the political uncertainty in the United Kingdom surrounding Brexit. For more information relating to this topic, see Risk Factors - Our substantial international business operations subject us to a number of operating, economic, political, regulatory and other international business risks. Intellectual property and licenses The Company markets products and services under various trademarks, trade dress and trade names and relies on a combination of patent, copyright, trademark, service mark and trade secret laws, as well as contractual restrictions to establish and protect its proprietary rights. The Company owns numerous domain names, holds numerous patents, has registered numerous trademarks and has filed applications for the registration of a number of other trademarks and service marks in various jurisdictions. The Company holds assorted business licenses (such as pharmacy, occupational, liquor and cigarette) having various lives within multiple legal jurisdictions, which are necessary for the normal operation of the business. Seasonal variations in business The Companys business is affected by a number of factors including, among others, its sales performance during holiday periods (including particularly the winter holiday season) and during the cough, cold and flu season (the timing and severity of which is difficult to predict), significant weather conditions, the timing of its own or competitor discount programs and pricing actions and the timing of changes in levels of reimbursement from governmental agencies and other third-party payers. See the summary of quarterly results (unaudited) in note 19 , supplementary financial information , to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in part II, item 8 below. Sources and availability of raw materials Inventories are purchased from numerous domestic and foreign suppliers. The Company does not believe that the loss of any one supplier or group of suppliers under common control would have a material adverse effect on its business or that of any of its divisions. Working capital practices Effective inventory management is important to the Companys operations. The Company uses various inventory management techniques, including demand forecasting and planning and various forms of replenishment management. Its working capital needs typically are greater in the months leading up to the winter holiday season. The Company generally finances its inventory and expansion needs with internally-generated funds and short-term debt. For additional information, see the liquidity and capital resources section in managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in part II, item 7, below. Customers The Company sells to numerous retail and wholesale customers. No single customer accounted for more than 10% of the Companys consolidated sales for any of the periods presented. In fiscal 2019 , substantially all of our retail pharmacy sales - 7 - were to customers covered by third-party payers (e.g., pharmacy benefit managers, insurance companies and governmental agencies) that agree to pay for all or a portion of a customer's eligible prescription purchases. Two third-party payers, in the Retail Pharmacy USA division, in the aggregate accounted for approximately 22% of the Companys consolidated sales in fiscal 2019 . See note 16 , segment reporting , to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Regulation In the countries in which the Company does business, the Company is subject to national, state and local laws, regulations and administrative practices concerning retail and wholesale pharmacy operations, including regulations relating to the Companys participation in Medicare, Medicaid and other publicly financed health benefit plans; regulations prohibiting kickbacks, beneficiary inducement and the submission of false claims; the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA); the ACA; licensure and registration requirements concerning the operation of pharmacies and the practice of pharmacy; and regulations of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, the U.S. Federal Trade Commission, the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration and the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission, as well as regulations promulgated by comparable foreign, state and local governmental authorities concerning the operation of the Companys businesses. The Company is also subject to laws and regulations relating to licensing, tax, foreign trade, intellectual property, privacy and data protection, currency, political and other business restrictions. The Company is also governed by national, state and local laws of general applicability in the countries in which it does business, including laws regulating matters of working conditions, health and safety and equal employment opportunity. In connection with the operation of its businesses, the Company is subject to laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment and health and safety matters, including those governing exposure to, and the management and disposal of, hazardous substances. Environmental protection requirements did not have a material effect on the results of operations or capital expenditures of the Company in fiscal 2019 . Competitive conditions The industries in which the Company operates are highly competitive. As a leader in the retail pharmacy industry and as a retailer of general merchandise, the Company competes with various local, regional, national and global retailers, including chain and independent pharmacies, mail order prescription providers, grocery stores, convenience stores, mass merchants, online and omni-channel pharmacies and retailers, warehouse clubs, dollar stores and other discount merchandisers. The Companys pharmaceutical wholesale businesses compete with other pharmaceutical wholesalers as well as alternative supply sources such as importers and manufacturers who supply directly to pharmacies. The Company competes primarily on the basis of service, convenience, variety and price. Its geographic dispersion helps mitigate the impact of temporary, localized economic and competitive conditions in individual markets. See properties in part I, item 2, below for further information regarding the Companys geographic dispersion. Employees As of August 31, 2019 , the Company employed approximately 342,000 persons, approximately 110,000 of whom were part-time employees working less than 30 hours per week. The foregoing does not include employees of equity method investments.  Available information The Company files with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC) its Annual Report on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K and any amendments to those reports, as well as proxy statements and registration statements. In addition, the SEC maintains a website at http://www.sec.gov that contains reports, proxy and information statements and other information regarding issuers, including the Company, that file electronically. The Company makes available free of charge on or through its website at http://investor.walgreensbootsalliance.com its Annual Reports on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K and amendments to these reports filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act), as soon as reasonably practicable after the Company files or furnishes them to the SEC. The contents of the website are not, however, a part of this Form 10-K or the Companys other SEC filings. ", "1A": " Item 1A. Risk factors In addition to the other information in this report and our other filings with the SEC, you should carefully consider the risks described below, which could materially and adversely affect our business operations, financial condition and results of operations. These risks are not the only risks that we face. Our business operations could also be affected by additional factors that are not presently known to us or that we currently consider to be immaterial. - 8 - Reductions in third-party reimbursement levels, from private or governmental agency plans, and potential changes in industry pricing benchmarks for prescription drugs could materially and adversely affect our results of operations. The substantial majority of the prescriptions we fill are reimbursed by third-party payers, including private and governmental agency payers. The continued efforts of health maintenance organizations, managed care organizations, PBM companies, governmental agencies, and other third-party payers to reduce prescription drug costs and pharmacy reimbursement rates, as well as litigation and other legal proceedings relating to how drugs are priced, may adversely impact our results of operations. In the United States, plan changes with rate adjustments often occur in January and our reimbursement arrangements may provide for rate adjustments at prescribed intervals during their term. In addition, in an environment where some PBM clients utilize narrow or restricted pharmacy provider networks, some of these entities may offer pricing terms that we may not be willing to accept or otherwise restrict our participation in their networks of pharmacy providers. Changes in political, economic and regulatory influences also may significantly affect healthcare financing and prescription drug reimbursement practices. In the United States, for example, there have been multiple attempts through executive action, legislative action and legal challenges to modify or repeal the ACA, along with additional initiatives focused on increasing transparency and reducing costs in the U.S. healthcare system. We cannot predict whether current or future efforts to modify or repeal these laws will be successful, nor can we predict the impact that such a modification or repeal and any subsequent legislation would have on our business and reimbursement levels. There have also been a number of other proposals and enactments by the federal government and various states to reduce Medicare Part D and Medicaid reimbursement levels in response to budget deficits, and we expect additional proposals in the future. In the event that a third-party payers budgetary or financial condition deteriorates, they may not be able to pay timely, or may delay payment of, amounts owed to us. There can be no assurance that recent or future changes in prescription drug reimbursement policies and practices will not materially and adversely affect our results of operations. In many countries where we have operations, the government provides or subsidizes healthcare to consumers and regulates pharmaceutical prices, patient eligibility and reimbursement levels to control costs for the government-sponsored healthcare system. Efforts to control healthcare costs, including prescription drug costs, are continuous and reductions in third-party reimbursement levels could materially and adversely affect our results of operations. In addition, many payers in the United States are increasingly considering new metrics as the basis for reimbursement rates. It is possible that the pharmaceutical industry or regulators may evaluate and/or develop an alternative pricing reference to replace average wholesale price, which is the pricing reference used for many of our contracts. In addition, many state Medicaid fee-for-service programs have established pharmacy network payments on the basis of actual acquisition cost, which could have an impact on reimbursement practices in other commercial and governmental arrangements. Future changes to the pricing benchmarks used to establish pharmaceutical pricing, including changes in the basis for calculating reimbursement by third-party payers, could adversely affect us. A shift in pharmacy mix toward lower margin plans, products, and programs could adversely affect our results of operations. Our Retail Pharmacy USA division seeks to grow prescription volume while operating in a marketplace with continuous reimbursement pressure. A shift in the mix of pharmacy prescription volume towards programs offering lower reimbursement rates could adversely affect our results of operations. For example, our Retail Pharmacy USA division has experienced a shift in pharmacy mix towards 90-day at retail in recent years, and specialty pharmacy represents a significant and growing proportion of prescription drug spending in the United States and a correspondingly larger proportion of our revenues. Our 90-day at retail offering for patients with chronic prescription needs typically is at a lower margin than comparable 30-day prescriptions, and specialty pharmacy sales are generally also lower margin. Our Retail Pharmacy USA division also has experienced a shift in pharmacy mix towards Medicare Part D prescriptions in recent years, and that trend may continue. Preferred Medicare Part D networks have increased in number in recent years; however, we do not participate in all such networks. We have accepted lower reimbursement rates in order to secure preferred relationships with Medicare Part D plans serving senior patients with significant pharmacy needs. We also have worked to develop and expand our relationships with commercial third-party payers to enable new and/or improved market access via participation in the pharmacy provider networks they offer. If we are not able to generate additional prescription volume and other business from patients participating in these programs that is sufficient to offset the impact of lower reimbursement, or if the degree or terms of our participation in such preferred networks declines from current levels in future years, our results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. We derive a significant portion of our sales in the United States from prescription drug sales reimbursed by a limited number of pharmacy benefit management companies. - 9 - We derive a significant portion of our sales in the United States from prescription drug sales reimbursed through prescription drug plans administered by a limited number of PBM companies. PBM companies typically administer multiple prescription drug plans that expire at various times and provide for varying reimbursement rates, and often limit coverage to specific drug products on an approved list, known as a formulary, which might not include all of the approved drugs for a particular indication. Contracts with certain PBM companies that we have historically done substantial business with are due for renewal in fiscal 2020. There can be no assurance that we will continue to participate in any particular PBM companys pharmacy provider network in any particular future time period or on terms reasonably acceptable to us. If our participation in the pharmacy provider network for a prescription drug plan administered by one or more of the large PBM companies is restricted or terminated, we expect that our sales would be adversely affected, at least in the short-term. If we are unable to replace any such lost sales, either through an increase in other sales or through a resumption of participation in those plans, our operating results could be materially and adversely affected. If we exit a pharmacy provider network and later resume participation, there can be no assurance that we will achieve any particular level of business on any particular pace, or that all clients of the PBM company will choose to include us again in the pharmacy network for their plans, initially or at all. In addition, in such circumstances we may incur increased marketing and other costs in connection with initiatives to regain former patients and attract new patients covered by such plans. We could be adversely affected by a decrease in the introduction of new brand name and generic prescription drugs as well as increases in the cost to procure prescription drugs. The profitability of our pharmacy businesses depends upon the utilization of prescription drugs. Utilization trends are affected by, among other factors, the introduction of new and successful prescription drugs as well as lower-priced generic alternatives to existing brand name drugs. Inflation in the price of drugs also can adversely affect utilization, particularly given the increased prevalence of high-deductible health insurance plans and related plan design changes. New brand name drugs can result in increased drug utilization and associated sales, while the introduction of lower priced generic alternatives typically results in relatively lower sales, but relatively higher gross profit margins. Accordingly, a decrease in the number or magnitude of significant new brand name drugs or generics successfully introduced, delays in their introduction, or a decrease in the utilization of previously introduced prescription drugs, could materially and adversely affect our results of operations. In addition, if we experience an increase in the amounts we pay to procure pharmaceutical drugs, including generic drugs, it could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. Our gross profit margins would be adversely affected to the extent we are not able to offset such cost increases. Any failure to fully offset any such increased prices and costs or to modify our activities to mitigate the impact could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. Additionally, any future changes in drug prices could be significantly different than our expectations. Consolidation and strategic alliances in the healthcare industry could adversely affect our business operations, competitive positioning, financial condition and results of operations. Many organizations in the healthcare industry, including PBM companies, have consolidated in recent years to create larger healthcare enterprises with greater bargaining power, which has resulted in greater pricing pressures. If this consolidation trend continues, it could give the resulting enterprises even greater bargaining power, which may lead to further pressure on the prices for our products and services. If these pressures result in reductions in our prices, our businesses would become less profitable unless we are able to achieve corresponding reductions in costs or develop profitable new revenue streams. New and proposed acquisitions, partnerships and strategic alliances in the healthcare industry also can alter market dynamics and impact our businesses and competitive positioning. For example, in November 2018, CVS Health Corporation, an integrated pharmacy health care company that operates one of the largest retail drugstore chains and PBM companies in the United States, acquired Aetna, Inc., one of the largest diversified health care benefits companies. Changes in the participants in global sourcing enterprises relating to drug procurement, whether as a result of mergers, acquisitions or other transactions, can also have a similar effect on market dynamics and our business. In addition, further consolidation among generic drug manufacturers could lead to generic drug inflation in the future. We expect that market demand, government regulation, third-party reimbursement policies, government contracting requirements, and other pressures will continue to cause the healthcare industry to evolve, potentially resulting in further business consolidations and alliances and increased vertical integration among the industry participants we engage with, and which could, if we are not able to successfully anticipate and respond to evolving industry conditions in a timely and effective manner, materially and adversely impact our business operations, financial condition and results of operations. Our growth strategy is partially dependent upon our ability to identify and successfully complete acquisitions, joint ventures and other strategic partnerships and alliances. - 10 - A significant element of our growth strategy is to identify, pursue and successfully complete and integrate acquisitions, joint ventures and other strategic partnerships and alliances that either expand or complement our existing operations. We have grown significantly through acquisitions in recent years and expect to continue to acquire, partner with or invest in businesses that build on or are deemed complementary to our existing businesses or further our strategic objectives. Due in part to consolidation in the industries in which we compete, there is significant competition for attractive targets and opportunities when available. There can be no assurance that attractive acquisition or other strategic relationship opportunities will be available, that we will be successful in identifying, negotiating and consummating favorable transaction opportunities, or that any such transactions we complete will be successful and justify our investment of financial and other resources. Acquisitions and other strategic transactions involve numerous risks, including difficulties in successfully integrating the operations and personnel, navigating the necessary regulatory approval requirements, distraction of management from overseeing, and disruption of, our existing operations, difficulties in entering markets or lines of business in which we have no or limited direct prior experience, the possible loss of key employees and customers, and difficulties in achieving the synergies we anticipated. Any failure to select suitable opportunities at fair prices, conduct appropriate due diligence and successfully integrate the acquired company, including particularly when acquired businesses operate in new geographic markets or areas of business, could materially and adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations. These transactions may also cause us to significantly increase our interest expense, leverage and debt service requirements if we incur additional debt to pay for an acquisition or investment, issue common stock that would dilute our current stockholders percentage ownership, or incur asset write-offs and restructuring costs and other related expenses that could have a material adverse impact on our operating results. Acquisitions, joint ventures and strategic investments also involve numerous other risks, including potential exposure to assumed litigation and unknown environmental and other liabilities, as well as undetected internal control, regulatory or other issues, or additional costs not anticipated at the time the transaction was completed. No assurance can be given that our acquisitions, joint ventures and other strategic partnerships and alliances will be successful and will not materially adversely affect our business operations, financial condition or results of operations. If we are unable to successfully identify, complete and integrate acquisitions, joint ventures and strategic investments in a timely and effective manner, our business operations and growth strategies could be negatively affected. Our strategic relationships include outsourcing and similar relationships. We outsource certain business and administrative functions and rely on third parties to perform certain services on our behalf. We rely on these third parties to meet our quality and performance requirements and to timely perform as expected. We periodically negotiate provisions and renewals of these relationships, and there can be no assurance that such terms will remain acceptable to us or such third parties. If our continuing relationship with certain third-party providers is interrupted, or if such third-party providers experience disruptions or do not perform as anticipated, or we experience problems with any transition, we may experience operational difficulties, reputational harm, and increased costs that could materially and adversely affect our business operations and results of operations. We are exposed to risks related to litigation and other legal proceedings. We operate in a highly regulated and litigious environment. We are involved in legal proceedings, including litigation, arbitration and other claims, and investigations, inspections, audits, claims, inquiries and similar actions by pharmacy, healthcare, tax and other governmental authorities, including those contained in note 10, commitments and contingencies, to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in part II, item 8 of this Form 10-K. For example, in January 2019, Walgreen Co., on behalf of itself, its subsidiaries and certain identified affiliates, resolved matters regarding certain dispensing practices by entering into, among other things, a Corporate Integrity Agreement with the Office of Inspector General of the United States Department of Health and Human Services. The Corporate Integrity Agreement has a five-year term and provides that Walgreen Co. shall, among other things, continue the compliance program it created to address compliance with federal health care program requirements, provide annual certifications of compliance and provide training and education for certain covered employees. Failure to meet the Corporate Integrity Agreement obligations could have material adverse consequences for us, including reputational harm and monetary penalties for each instance of non-compliance. In addition, in the event of a breach or deliberate violation of the Corporate Integrity Agreement, we could be excluded from participation in federal healthcare programs, or subjected to other significant penalties, which could seriously harm our results of operations, liquidity and financial results. Legal proceedings, in general, and securities, derivative action and class action and multi-district litigation, in particular, can be expensive and disruptive. Some of these suits may purport or may be determined to be class actions and/or involve parties seeking large and/or indeterminate amounts, including punitive or exemplary damages, and may remain unresolved for several years. For example, we are a defendant in numerous litigation proceedings relating to opioids. From time to time, the Company is also involved in legal proceedings as a plaintiff involving antitrust, tax, contract, intellectual property and other matters. See note 10, commitments and contingencies, for more information. - 11 - The Companys financial results may also be adversely affected by the litigation and other legal proceedings of companies in which it has an equity method investment. Any unfavorable outcome or settlement related to these proceedings could have a material adverse effect on the Companys financial results. Like other companies in the retail pharmacy and pharmaceutical wholesale industries, the Company is subject to extensive regulation by national, state and local government agencies in the United States and other countries in which it operates. There continues to be a heightened level of review and/or audit by regulatory authorities of, and increased litigation regarding, the Companys and the rest of the health care and related industrys business, compliance and reporting practices. As a result, the Company regularly is the subject of government actions of the types described above. In addition, under the qui tam or whistleblower provisions of the federal and various state false claims acts, persons may bring lawsuits alleging that a violation of the federal anti-kickback statute or similar laws has resulted in the submission of false claims to federal and/or state healthcare programs, including Medicare and Medicaid. After a private party has filed a qui tam action, the government must investigate the private party's claim and determine whether to intervene in and take control over the litigation. These actions may remain under seal while the government makes this determination. We cannot predict with certainty the outcomes of these legal proceedings and other contingencies, and the costs incurred in litigation can be substantial, regardless of the outcome. Substantial unanticipated verdicts, fines and rulings do sometimes occur. As a result, we could from time to time incur judgments, enter into settlements or revise our expectations regarding the outcome of certain matters, and such developments could harm our reputation and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in the period in which the amounts are accrued and/or our cash flows in the period in which the amounts are paid. In addition, as a result of governmental investigations or proceedings, the Company may be subject to damages, civil or criminal fines or penalties, or other sanctions, including the possible suspension or loss of licensure and/or suspension or exclusion from participation in government programs. The outcome of some of these legal proceedings and other contingencies could require us to take, or refrain from taking, actions which could negatively affect our operations. Additionally, defending against these lawsuits and proceedings may involve significant expense and diversion of managements attention and resources. Our business results depend on our ability to successfully manage ongoing organizational change and business transformation and achieve cost savings and operating efficiency initiatives. Our Board of Directors approved the plans to implement the Transformational Cost Management Program and the Store Optimization Program each as described in managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in part II, item 7 below as part of an initiative to reduce costs and increase operating efficiencies. There can be no assurance that we will realize, in full or in part, the anticipated benefits of these programs. Our financial goals assume a level of productivity improvement, including those reflected in the Transformational Cost Management Program, the Store Optimization Program and other business optimization initiatives. If we are unable to deliver these expected productivity improvements, while continuing to invest in business growth, or if the volume and nature of change overwhelms available resources, our business operations and financial results could be materially and adversely impacted. Our ability to successfully manage and execute these initiatives and realize expected savings and benefits in the amounts and at the times anticipated is important to our business success. Any failure to do so, which could result from our inability to successfully execute organizational change and business transformation plans, changes in global or regional economic conditions, competition, changes in the industries in which we compete, unanticipated costs or charges, loss of key personnel and other factors described herein, could have a material adverse effect on our businesses, financial condition and results of operations. The industries in which we operate are highly competitive and constantly evolving. New entrants to the market, existing competitor actions or other changes in market dynamics could adversely impact us. The level of competition in the retail pharmacy and pharmaceutical wholesale industries is high. Changes in market dynamics or actions of competitors or manufacturers, including industry consolidation and the emergence of new competitors and strategic alliances, could materially and adversely impact us. Disruptive innovation, or the perception of potentially disruptive innovation, by existing or new competitors could alter the competitive landscape in the future and require us to accurately identify and assess such changes and if required make timely and effective changes to our strategies and business model to compete effectively. For example, in September 2018, online retailer Amazon.com, Inc. acquired PillPack, an online pharmacy with licenses throughout the United States. Some industry analysts have speculated that the PillPack acquisition could provide a platform for Amazon to significantly expand into the market for prescription drugs. Our retail pharmacy businesses face intense competition from local, regional, national and global companies, including other drugstore and pharmacy chains, independent drugstores and pharmacies, mail-order pharmacies and various other retailers such as grocery stores, convenience stores, mass merchants, online and omni-channel pharmacies and retailers, warehouse clubs, dollar stores and other discount merchandisers, some of which are aggressively expanding in markets we serve. Businesses in our Pharmaceutical Wholesale division face intense competition from direct competitors, including national and regional cooperative wholesalers, and - 12 - alternative supply sources such as importers and manufacturers who supply directly to pharmacies. Competition may also come from other sources in the future. As competition increases in the markets in which we operate, a significant increase in general pricing pressures could occur, including pressure on the convenience premium of our retail pricing model, which could require us to reevaluate our pricing structures to remain competitive. For example, if we are not able to anticipate and successfully respond to changes in market conditions in our Pharmaceutical Wholesale division, including changes driven by competitors, suppliers or manufacturers and increased competition from national and regional cooperative wholesalers, it could result in a loss of customers or renewal of contracts or arrangements on less favorable terms. We also could be adversely affected if we fail to identify or effectively respond to changes in market dynamics. As technology, consumer behavior, omni-channel and differential retail models, and market conditions continue to evolve in the United States, it is important that we maintain the relevance of our brand and product and service offerings to customers and patients. In recent years, we announced that we are testing a number of concepts and initiatives designed to position our stores in the United States as convenient neighborhood health destinations for healthcare and retail products and services. The concepts being tested include new approaches to pricing and promotions, product selection, in-store and digital experience, and strategic partnerships that bring new products and services to our customers. We plan to use these pilots to listen to customers, learn and adjust based on feedback, with decisions on the nature and extent of further roll-outs made over time as we gain experience. If our customers are not receptive to these changes, if we are unable to expand successful programs in a timely manner, or we otherwise do not effectively respond to changes in market dynamics, our businesses and financial performance could be materially and adversely affected. Additionally, specialty pharmacy represents a significant and growing proportion of prescription drug spending in the United States, a significant portion of which is dispensed outside of traditional retail pharmacies. Because our specialty pharmacy business focuses on complex and high-cost medications, many of which are made available by manufacturers to a limited number of pharmacies (so-called limited distribution drugs), that serve a relatively limited universe of patients, the future growth of this business depends to a significant extent upon expanding our ability to access key drugs and successfully penetrate key treatment categories. Accordingly, it is important that we and our affiliates compete effectively in this evolving market, or our business operations, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. To better serve this evolving market, in March 2017, we and Prime Therapeutics LLC, a PBM, closed a transaction to form a combined central specialty pharmacy and mail services company, AllianceRx Walgreens Prime, using an innovative model that seeks to align pharmacy, PBM and health plans to coordinate patient care, improve health outcomes and deliver cost of care opportunities. If this joint venture is not able to compete effectively in this evolving market and successfully adapt to changing market conditions, our business operations, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. Our substantial international business operations subject us to a number of operating, economic, political, regulatory and other international business risks. Our substantial international business operations are important to our growth and prospects, including particularly those of our Retail Pharmacy International and Pharmaceutical Wholesale divisions, and are subject to a number of risks, including: ##TABLE_START  compliance with a wide variety of foreign laws and regulations, including retail and wholesale pharmacy, licensing, tax, foreign trade, intellectual property, privacy and data protection, immigration, currency, political and other business restrictions and requirements and local laws and regulations, whose interpretation and enforcement vary significantly among jurisdictions and can change significantly over time; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  additional U.S. and other regulation of non-domestic operations, including regulation under the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the UK Bribery Act and other anti-corruption laws; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  potential difficulties in managing foreign operations, mitigating credit risks in foreign markets, enforcing agreements and collecting receivables through foreign legal systems; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  price controls imposed by foreign countries, tariffs, duties or other restrictions on foreign currencies or trade sanctions and other trade barriers imposed by foreign countries that restrict or prohibit business transactions in certain markets, or fluctuations in currency rates; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  impact of recessions and economic slowdowns in economies outside the United States, including foreign currency devaluation, higher interest rates, inflation, and increased government regulation or ownership of traditional private businesses; ##TABLE_END - 13 - ##TABLE_START  the instability of foreign economies, governments and currencies and unexpected regulatory, economic or political changes in foreign markets; and ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  developing and emerging markets may be especially vulnerable to periods of instability and unexpected changes, and consumers in those markets may have relatively limited resources to spend on products and services. ##TABLE_END These factors can also adversely affect our payers, vendors and customers in international markets, which in turn can negatively impact our businesses. We cannot assure you that one or more of these factors will not have a material adverse effect on our business operations, results of operation and financial condition. Many of these factors are subject to change based on changes in political, economic and regulatory influences. For example: ##TABLE_START  Our Retail Pharmacy International and Pharmaceutical Wholesale divisions have substantial operations in the United Kingdom and other member countries of the European Union. In June 2016, voters in the United Kingdom approved an advisory referendum to withdraw from the European Union, which proposed exit (and the political, economic and other uncertainties it has raised), commonly referred to as Brexit, has exacerbated and may further exacerbate many of the risks and uncertainties described above. An original exit date was set for March 29, 2019, but following the UK parliaments rejection of a negotiated outcome, the leaders of the member countries of the European Union have agreed to multiple extensions of the deadline for Brexit. Given the complexity and uncertainty surrounding the potential withdrawal and negotiations, including with respect to terms of trade and customs, there can be no assurance regarding the terms, timing or consummation of any such arrangements, and whether there will be an orderly withdrawal from the European Union or a so-called hard Brexit with no continuing UK participation in the EUs Single Market or the EU Customs Union. The proposed withdrawal could, among other potential outcomes, adversely affect the tax, tax treaty, currency, operational, legal and regulatory regimes to which our businesses in the region are subject. The withdrawal could also, among other potential outcomes, disrupt the free movement of goods, services and people between the United Kingdom and the European Union and significantly disrupt trade between the United Kingdom and the European Union and other parties. Further, uncertainty around and developments regarding these and related issues has contributed to deteriorating market conditions and could further adversely impact consumer and investor confidence and the economy of the United Kingdom and the economies of other countries in which we operate and cause significant volatility in currency exchange rates. In the event of a hard Brexit, the related risks and uncertainties could be further exacerbated; and ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  Many of the products we sell are manufactured in whole or in part outside of the United States. In some cases, these products are imported by others and sold to us. In the United States, the Presidential Administration has discussed, and in some cases implemented, changes with respect to certain tax and trade policies, tariffs and other government regulations affecting trade between the United States and other countries. For example, concerns regarding trade relations between the United States and China have escalated during fiscal 2019 and discussions have continued through the date of this report, as both countries imposed significant tariffs on the importation of certain product categories. As a significant portion of our retail products are sourced from China, the imposition on the United States of these and any additional new tariffs on certain goods imported from China have adversely affected costs and could impact the profitability of retail product sales in our Retail Pharmacy USA division. While it is not possible to predict whether or when any additional changes will occur or what form they may take, significant changes in tax or trade policies, tariffs or trade relations between the United States and other countries could result in significant increases in our costs, restrict our access to certain suppliers and adversely impact economic activity. In addition, other countries may change their business and trade policies in anticipation of or in response to increased import tariffs and other changes in United States trade policy and regulations. ##TABLE_END  There can be no assurance that any or all of these developments will not have a material adverse effect on our business operations, results of operations and financial condition. We are exposed to risks associated with foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. We operate in 25  countries across the globe, and our  significant operations outside of the United States expose us to currency exchange rate fluctuations and related risks, including transaction currency exposures relating to the import and export of goods in currencies other than businesses functional currencies as well as currency translation exposures relating to profits and net assets denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. We present our financial statements in U.S. dollars and have a significant proportion of net assets and income in non-U.S. dollar currencies, primarily the British pound sterling and the Euro, as well as a range of other foreign currencies. Our results of operations and capital ratios can therefore be sensitive to movements in foreign exchange rates. Due to the constantly changing currency exposures to which we are subject and the - 14 - volatility of currency exchange rates, we cannot predict the effect of exchange rate fluctuations upon our future results of operations. In addition, fluctuations in currencies relative to the U.S. dollar may make it more difficult to perform period-to-period comparisons of our reported results of operations. A depreciation of non-U.S. dollar currencies relative to the U.S. dollar could have a significant adverse impact on our results of operations. We may from time to time, in some instances, enter into foreign currency contracts or other derivative instruments intended to hedge a portion of our foreign currency fluctuation risks, which subjects us to additional risks, such as the risk that counterparties may fail to honor their obligations to us, that could materially and adversely affect us. Additionally, we may (and currently do) use foreign currency debt to hedge some of our foreign currency fluctuation risks. The periodic use of such hedging activities may not offset any or more than a portion of the adverse financial effects of unfavorable movements in foreign exchange rates over the limited time the hedges are in place. We cannot assure you that fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, including particularly the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against major currencies or the currencies of large developing countries, will not materially affect our consolidated financial results. We may experience a significant disruption in our information technology and computer systems. We rely extensively on our computer systems to manage our ordering, pricing, point-of-sale, pharmacy fulfillment, inventory replenishment, customer loyalty programs, finance and other processes. Our systems are subject to damage or interruption from power outages, facility damage, computer and telecommunications failures, computer viruses, security breaches including credit card or personally identifiable information breaches, vandalism, natural disasters, catastrophic events, human error and potential cyber threats, including malicious codes, worms, phishing attacks, denial of service attacks, ransomware and other sophisticated cyber attacks, and our disaster recovery planning cannot account for all eventualities. If any of our systems are damaged, fail to function properly or otherwise become unavailable, we may incur substantial costs to repair or replace them, and may experience loss or corruption of critical data and interruptions or disruptions and delays in our ability to perform critical functions, which could materially and adversely affect our businesses and results of operations. In addition, we are currently making, and expect to continue to make, substantial investments in our information technology systems and infrastructure, some of which are significant. Upgrades involve replacing existing systems with successor systems, outsourcing critical information technology to third parties, making changes to existing systems, including the migration of applications to the cloud, or cost-effectively acquiring new systems with new functionality. Implementing new systems carries significant potential risks, including failure to operate as designed, potential loss or corruption of data or information, changes in security processes, cost overruns, implementation delays, disruption of operations, and the potential inability to meet business and reporting requirements. We rely on strategic partners and other service providers to help us with certain significant information technology projects and services. Information technology projects or services frequently are long-term in nature and may take longer to complete and cost more than we expect and may not deliver the benefits we project once they are complete. There can be no assurance that we and our strategic partners and service providers will be able to deliver the required functionality of our information technology projects or services within the required timeframe and budget. Furthermore, pursuing multiple initiatives simultaneously could make implementation significantly more challenging. We are aware of inherent risks associated with replacing these systems and outsourcing critical information technology functions and there can be no assurance that we will not experience significant issues with our existing systems prior to implementation, that our technology initiatives will be successfully deployed as planned or that they will be timely implemented without significant disruption to our operations. We also could be adversely affected by any significant disruption in the systems of third parties we interact with, including key payers and vendors. Any system implementation and transition difficulty may result in operational challenges, reputational harm, and increased costs that could materially and adversely affect our business operations and results of operations. If we or the businesses we interact with do not maintain the privacy and security of sensitive customer and business information, it could damage our reputation and we could suffer a loss of revenue, incur substantial additional costs and become subject to litigation and regulatory scrutiny. The protection of customer, employee, and company data is critical to our businesses. Cybersecurity and other information technology security risks, such as a significant breach of customer, employee, or company data, could create significant workflow disruption, attract a substantial amount of media attention, damage our customer relationships, reputation and brand, and result in lost sales, fines or lawsuits. Throughout our operations, we receive, retain and transmit certain personal information that our customers and others provide to purchase products or services, fill prescriptions, enroll in promotional programs, participate in our customer loyalty programs, register on our websites, or otherwise communicate and interact with us. In addition, aspects of our operations depend upon the secure transmission of confidential information over public networks. Like other global companies, we and businesses we interact with have experienced threats to data and systems, including by perpetrators of random or targeted malicious cyber-attacks, computer viruses, worms, bot attacks or other - 15 - destructive or disruptive software and attempts to misappropriate customer information, including credit card information, and cause system failures and disruptions. Any compromise of our data security systems or of those of businesses with whom we interact, which results in confidential information being accessed, obtained, damaged or used by unauthorized or improper persons, could harm our reputation and expose us to regulatory actions, customer attrition, remediation expenses, and claims from customers, financial institutions, payment card associations and other persons, any of which could materially and adversely affect our business operations, financial condition and results of operations. Because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access, disable or degrade service, or sabotage systems change frequently and may not immediately produce signs of intrusion, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures. In addition, a security breach could require that we expend substantial additional resources related to the security of information systems and disrupt our businesses. We depend on and interact with the information technology networks and systems of third-parties for many aspects of our business operations, including payers, strategic partners and cloud service providers. These third parties may have access to information we maintain about our company, operations, customers, employees and vendors, or operating systems that are critical to or can significantly impact our business operations. Like us, these third-parties are subject to risks imposed by data breaches and cyber-attacks and other events or actions that could damage, disrupt or close down their networks or systems. Any expansion of information technology outsourcing, including through arrangements with our strategic partners, may increase vulnerabilities and weaknesses relating to cybersecurity and data management. Security processes, protocols and standards that we have implemented and contractual provisions requiring security measures that we may have sought to impose on such third-parties may not be sufficient or effective at preventing such events, which could result in unauthorized access to, or disruptions or denials of access to, or misuse of, information or systems that are important to our business, including proprietary information, sensitive or confidential data, and other information about our operations, customers, employees and suppliers, including personal information. The regulatory environment surrounding data security and privacy is increasingly demanding, with the frequent imposition of new and changing requirements across businesses and geographic areas. We are required to comply with increasingly complex and changing data security and privacy regulations in the United States and in other jurisdictions in which we operate that regulate the collection, use and transfer of personal data, including the transfer of personal data between or among countries. In the United States, for example, HIPAA imposes extensive privacy and security requirements governing the transmission, use and disclosure of health information by covered entities in the health care industry, including health care providers such as pharmacies. In addition, the California Consumer Privacy Act, which goes into effect on January 1, 2020, imposes stringent requirements on the use and treatment of personal information of California residents, which term is broadly defined to include, among other things, information that identifies, relates to, describes, is capable of being associated with, or could reasonably be linked to a consumer or household. Other U.S. states have enacted, or are proposing similar laws related to the protection of personal data. In addition, the U.S. federal government is considering federal privacy legislation. Outside the United States, many of our business units operate in countries with stringent data protection regulations, and these laws continue to change. For example, the European Unions General Data Protection Regulation, which became effective in May 2018, greatly increased the jurisdictional reach of European Union data protection laws and added a broad array of requirements for handling personal data, including the public disclosure of significant data breaches, and provides for greater penalties for noncompliance. Other countries have enacted or are considering enacting data localization laws that require certain data to stay within their borders. Complying with changing regulatory requirements requires us to incur substantial costs and may require changes to our business practices in certain jurisdictions, any of which could materially and adversely affect our business operations and operating results. We may also face audits or investigations by one or more domestic or foreign government agencies relating to our compliance with these regulations. Compliance with changes in privacy and information security laws and standards may result in significant expense due to increased investment in technology and the development of new operational processes. If we or those with whom we share information fail to comply with these laws and regulations or experience a data security breach, our reputation could be damaged and we could be subject to additional litigation and regulatory risks, particularly to the extent the breach relates to sensitive data. Our security measures may be undermined due to the actions of outside parties, employee error, malfeasance, or otherwise, and, as a result, an unauthorized party may obtain access to our data systems and misappropriate business and personal information. Any such breach or unauthorized access could result in significant legal and financial exposure, damage to our reputation and credibility, and potentially have a material adverse effect on our business operations, financial condition and results of operations. A significant change in, or noncompliance with, governmental regulations and other legal requirements could have a material adverse effect on our reputation and profitability. We operate in complex, highly regulated environments around the world and could be materially and adversely affected by changes to applicable legal requirements including the related interpretations and enforcement practices, new legal requirements and/or any failure to comply with applicable regulations. Businesses in our Pharmaceutical Wholesale division - 16 - are subject to a range of regulations relating to such things as product margins, product traceability and the conditions under which products must be stored. Our retail pharmacy and health and wellness services businesses are subject to numerous country, state and local regulations including licensing, billing practices, utilization and other requirements for pharmacies and reimbursement arrangements. The regulations to which we are subject include, but are not limited to: country and state registration and regulation of pharmacies and drug discount card programs; dispensing and sale of controlled substances and products containing pseudoephedrine; applicable governmental payer regulations including Medicare and Medicaid; data privacy and security laws and regulations including HIPAA; the ACA or any successor thereto; laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment and health and safety matters, each of which continues to evolve, including those governing exposure to, and the management and disposal of, hazardous substances; regulations regarding food and drug safety including those of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), trade regulations including those of the U.S. Federal Trade Commission, and consumer protection and safety regulations including those of the Consumer Product Safety Commission, as well as state regulatory authorities, governing the availability, sale, advertisement and promotion of products we sell as well as our loyalty and drug discount card programs; anti-kickback laws; false claims laws; laws against the corporate practice of medicine; and foreign, national and state laws governing health care fraud and abuse and the practice of the profession of pharmacy. For example, in the United States, the DEA, FDA and various other regulatory authorities regulate the distribution and dispensing of pharmaceuticals and controlled substances. We are required to hold valid DEA and state-level licenses, meet various security and operating standards and comply with the federal and various state controlled substance acts and related regulations governing the sale, dispensing, disposal, holding and distribution of controlled substances. The DEA, FDA and state regulatory authorities have broad enforcement powers, including the ability to seize or recall products and impose significant criminal, civil and administrative sanctions for violations of these laws and regulations. We are also governed by foreign, national and state laws of general applicability, including laws regulating matters of working conditions, health and safety and equal employment opportunity and other labor and employment matters as well as employee benefit, competition and antitrust matters. In addition, we could have significant exposure if we are found to have infringed another partys intellectual property rights. Changes in laws, regulations and policies and the related interpretations and enforcement practices may alter the landscape in which we do business and may significantly affect our cost of doing business. The impact of new laws, regulations and policies and the related interpretations and enforcement practices generally cannot be predicted, and changes in applicable laws, regulations and policies and the related interpretations and enforcement practices may require extensive system and operational changes, be difficult to implement, increase our operating costs and require significant capital expenditures. Untimely compliance or noncompliance with applicable laws and regulations could result in the imposition of civil and criminal penalties that could adversely affect the continued operation of our businesses, including: suspension of payments from government programs; loss of required government certifications; loss of authorizations to participate in or exclusion from government programs, including the Medicare and Medicaid programs in the United States and the National Health Service in the United Kingdom; loss of licenses; and significant fines or monetary penalties. Any failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements in the United States or in any of the countries in which we operate could result in significant legal and financial exposure, damage to our reputation and brand, and have a material adverse effect on our business operations, financial condition and results of operations. We could be adversely affected by violations of anti-bribery, anti-corruption and/or international trade laws. We are subject to laws concerning our business operations and marketing activities in foreign countries where we conduct business. For example, we are subject to the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (the FCPA), U.S. export control, anti-money laundering and economic and trade sanction laws, and similar anti-corruption and international trade laws in certain foreign countries, such as the UK Bribery Act, any violation of which could create substantial liability for us and also harm our reputation. The FCPA generally prohibits U.S. companies and their officers, directors, employees, and intermediaries from making improper payments to foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business abroad or otherwise obtaining favorable treatment. The FCPA also requires that U.S. public companies maintain books and records that fairly and accurately reflect transactions and maintain an adequate system of internal accounting controls. If we are found to have violated the FCPA, U.S. export control, economic and trade sanctions, or anti-money laundering laws or any other anti-bribery, anti-corruption or international trade laws or to have otherwise conducted business activities inappropriately or unethically, including through acts of bribery, corruption, conflicts of interest, fraud, manipulation of records or dealings with inappropriate business counterparties or partners, we may face penalties, sanctions including civil and criminal fines, disgorgement of profits, and suspension or debarment of our ability to contract with governmental agencies or receive export licenses. In addition, new initiatives may be proposed from time to time that impact the trading conditions in certain countries or regions, and may include retaliatory duties or trade sanctions which, if enacted, could adversely impact our trading relationships with vendors or other parties in such locations and have a material adverse effect on our operations. From time to time, we may face audits or investigations by one or more domestic or foreign governmental agencies relating to our international business activities, compliance with which could be costly and time-consuming, and could divert our management and key personnel from our - 17 - business operations. An adverse outcome under any such investigation or audit could damage our reputation and subject us to fines or other penalties, which could materially and adversely affect our business operations, financial condition, and results of operations. Disruption in our global supply chain could negatively impact our businesses. The products we sell are sourced from a wide variety of domestic and international vendors, and any future disruption in our supply chain or inability to find qualified vendors and access products that meet requisite quality and safety standards in a timely and efficient manner could adversely impact our businesses. The loss or disruption of such supply arrangements for any reason, including for issues such as labor disputes, loss or impairment of key manufacturing sites, inability to procure sufficient raw materials, quality control issues, ethical sourcing issues, a suppliers financial distress, natural disasters, civil unrest or acts of war or terrorism, trade sanctions or other external factors over which we have no control, could interrupt product supply and, if not effectively managed and remedied, have a material adverse impact on our business operations, financial condition and results of operations. We use a single wholesaler of branded and generic pharmaceutical drugs as our primary source of such products for our Retail Pharmacy USA division. In March 2013, Walgreens, Alliance Boots and AmerisourceBergen announced various agreements and arrangements, including a ten-year pharmaceutical distribution agreement between Walgreens and AmerisourceBergen pursuant to which we source branded and generic pharmaceutical products from AmerisourceBergen in the United States and an agreement which provides AmerisourceBergen the ability to access generic pharmaceutical products through our global sourcing enterprise. In May 2016, certain of these agreements were extended for three years to now expire in 2026. In addition, in March 2013, Walgreens, Alliance Boots and AmerisourceBergen entered into agreements and arrangements pursuant to which we have the right, but not the obligation, to purchase a minority equity position in AmerisourceBergen and gain associated representation on AmerisourceBergens board of directors in certain circumstances. As of the date of this report, AmerisourceBergen distributes for our Retail Pharmacy USA division substantially all branded and generic pharmaceutical products. Consequently, our business in the United States may be adversely affected by any operational, financial or regulatory difficulties that AmerisourceBergen experiences. For example, if AmerisourceBergens operations are seriously disrupted for any reason, whether due to a natural disaster, labor disruption, regulatory action, computer or operational systems or otherwise, it could adversely affect our business in the United States and our results of operations. Our distribution agreement with AmerisourceBergen is subject to early termination in certain circumstances and, upon the expiration or termination of the agreement, there can be no assurance that we or AmerisourceBergen will be willing to renew the agreement or enter into a new agreement, on terms favorable to us or at all. If such expiration or termination occurred, we believe that alternative sources of supply for most generic and brand-name pharmaceuticals are readily available and that we could obtain and qualify alternative sources, which may include self-distribution in some cases, for substantially all of the prescription drugs we sell on an acceptable basis, such that the impact of any such expiration or termination would be temporary. However, there can be no assurance we would be able to engage alternative supply sources or implement self-distribution processes on a timely basis or on terms favorable to us, or effectively manage these transitions, any of which could adversely affect our business operations, financial condition and results of operations. The anticipated strategic and financial benefits of our relationship with AmerisourceBergen may not be realized. As of August 31, 2019 , we beneficially owned approximately 27% of the outstanding AmerisourceBergen common stock and had designated one member of AmerisourceBergens board of directors. In addition, we have the right, but not the obligation, under the transactions contemplated by the Framework Agreement dated as of March 18, 2013 by and among the Company, Alliance Boots and AmerisourceBergen (the Framework Agreement) to acquire up to an additional 8,398,752 AmerisourceBergen shares in the open market and thereafter designate another member of AmerisourceBergens board of directors, subject in each case to applicable legal and contractual requirements. There can be no assurance that we will complete any specific level of such potential equity investments in AmerisourceBergen, or that our existing investment, or any future investment if completed, will ultimately be profitable. The Company accounts for its investment in AmerisourceBergen using the equity method of accounting, subject to a two-month reporting lag, with the net earnings attributable to the investment classified within the operating income of the Companys Pharmaceutical Wholesale segment. The financial performance of AmerisourceBergen, including any charges which may arise relating to its ongoing opioid litigation, will impact the Companys results of operations. Additionally, a substantial and sustained decline in the price of AmerisourceBergens common stock could trigger an impairment evaluation of - 18 - our investment. These considerations may materially and adversely affect the Companys financial condition and results of operations. Further, our ability to transact in AmerisourceBergen securities is subject to certain restrictions set forth in our agreements with AmerisourceBergen and arising under applicable laws and regulations, which in some circumstances could adversely our ability to transact in AmerisourceBergen securities in amounts and at the times desired. We could also encounter unforeseen costs, circumstances or issues existing or arising with respect to the transactions and collaboration resulting from these agreements. Many of these potential circumstances are outside of our control and any of them could result in increased costs, decreased revenue, decreased synergies and the diversion of management time and attention. If we are unable to achieve our objectives within the anticipated time frame, or at all, the expected benefits may not be realized fully or at all, or may take longer to realize than expected, which could have a material adverse impact on our business operations, financial condition and results of operations. We may not realize the anticipated benefits of the acquisition of assets from Rite Aid, which could adversely impact our results of operations. We entered into an agreement to acquire certain Rite Aid stores and distribution centers with the expectation that the transaction will result in various benefits, including, among other things, cost savings and operating efficiencies. The achievement of the anticipated benefits of the transaction is subject to a number of uncertainties, including completion of the pending acquisition of distribution centers and related inventory expected to be completed during fiscal 2020, whether the acquired assets can be integrated into our business in an efficient and effective manner, the possibility of faulty assumptions underlying expectations regarding potential synergies and the integration process, unforeseen expenses or delays, and competitive factors in the marketplace. We can provide no assurance that the anticipated benefits of the transaction, including cost savings and synergies, will be fully realized in the time frame anticipated or at all; the costs or difficulties related to the integration of the acquired assets into our business and operations will not be greater than expected; unanticipated costs, charges and expenses will not result from the transaction; litigation relating to the transaction will not be filed; and the transaction will not cause disruption to the parties business and operations and relationships with employees and suppliers, payers, customers and other third parties. If one or more of these risks are realized, it could have a material adverse impact on our operating results. From time to time, we make investments in companies over which we do not have sole control. Some of these companies may operate in sectors that differ from our current operations and have different risks. From time to time, we make debt or equity investments in companies that we may not control or over which we may not have sole control. For example, while we have a significant equity investment in AmerisourceBergen and have a designee serving on the board of directors of AmerisourceBergen as of the date of this report, we do not have the ability to control day-to-day operations of that company. Some of the businesses in which we have made noncontrolling investments operate in markets or industries that are different from our primary lines of business and/or operate in different geographic markets than we do. For example we have an equity investment in Sinopharm Holding GuoDa Drugstores Co., Ltd., a leading retail pharmacy chain in China. Investments in these businesses, among other risks, subject us to the operating and financial risks of the businesses we invest in and to the risk that we do not have sole control over the operations of these businesses. We rely on the internal controls and financial reporting controls of these entities and their failure to maintain effectiveness or comply with applicable standards may materially and adversely affect us. Investments in entities over which we do not have sole control, including joint ventures and strategic partnerships and alliances, present additional risks such as having differing objectives from our partners or the entities in which we are invested, becoming involved in disputes, or competing with those persons. Changes in economic conditions could adversely affect consumer buying practices. Our performance has been, and may continue to be, adversely impacted by changes in global, national, regional or local economic conditions and consumer confidence. These conditions can also adversely affect our key vendors and customers. External factors that affect consumer confidence and over which we exercise no influence include unemployment rates, inflation, levels of personal disposable income, levels of taxes and interest and global, national, regional or local economic conditions, as well as acts of war or terrorism. Changes in economic conditions and consumer confidence could adversely affect consumer preferences, purchasing power and spending patterns, which could lead to a decrease in overall consumer spending as well as in prescription drug and health services utilization and which could be exacerbated by the increasing prevalence of high-deductible health insurance plans and related plan design changes. Our business operations have been adversely affected by challenging market conditions in our Retail Pharmacy International division, particularly our Boots business in the United Kingdom, on account of the economic environment, including the uncertainty associated with Brexit. - 19 - In addition, reduced or flat consumer spending may drive us and our competitors to offer additional products at promotional prices. All of these factors could materially and adversely impact our business operations, financial condition and results of operations. Economic conditions in Europe and certain emerging market countries, together with austerity measures being taken by certain governments, could adversely affect us. We have significant assets and operations within Europe and certain emerging market countries in our Retail Pharmacy International and Pharmaceutical Wholesale divisions. An economic slowdown within any such markets could adversely affect our businesses in affected regions by reducing the prices our customers may be able or willing to pay for our products and services or by reducing the demand for our products and services, either of which could result in a material adverse impact on our results of operations. In recent years, in response to the economic environment, a number of governments, including the government in the United Kingdom, have announced or implemented austerity measures to reduce healthcare spending for the government-sponsored healthcare systems and constrain overall government expenditures. These measures, which include efforts aimed at reforming healthcare coverage and reducing healthcare costs, continue to exert pressure on the pricing of and reimbursement timelines for pharmaceutical drugs. Any new austerity measures may be similar to or vary in scope and nature from existing austerity measures and could have a material adverse effect on our international business operations and results of operations. If we do not successfully develop and maintain a relevant omni-channel experience for our customers, our businesses and results of operations could be adversely impacted. The portion of total consumer expenditures with retailers occurring online and through mobile applications has continued to increase and the pace of this increase could accelerate in the future. Our business has evolved from an in-store experience to interaction with customers across numerous channels, including in-store, online, mobile and social media, among others. Omni-channel and differentiated retail models are rapidly evolving and we must keep pace with changing customer expectations and new developments by our competitors. Our customers are increasingly using computers, tablets, mobile phones, and other devices to comparison shop, determine product availability and complete purchases, as well as to provide immediate public reactions regarding various facets of our operations. We must compete by offering a consistent and convenient shopping experience for our customers regardless of the ultimate sales channel and by investing in, providing and maintaining digital tools for our customers that have the right features and are reliable and easy to use. If we are unable to make, improve, or develop relevant customer-facing technology in a timely manner that keeps pace with technological developments and dynamic customer expectations, our ability to compete and our results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. In addition, if our online activities or our other customer-facing technology systems do not function as designed, we may experience a loss of customer confidence, data security breaches, lost sales, or be exposed to fraudulent purchases, any of which could materially and adversely affect our business operations, reputation and results of operations. If the merchandise and services that we offer fail to meet customer needs, our sales may be adversely affected. We could be adversely affected by changes in consumer spending levels and shopping habits and preferences, including attitudes towards our retail and product brands. The success of our retail pharmacy businesses depends on our ability to offer a superior shopping experience, engaging customer service and a quality assortment of available merchandise that differentiates us from other retailers, including enhanced health and beauty product offerings. We must identify, obtain supplies of, and offer to our customers attractive, innovative and high-quality merchandise on a continuous basis. Our products and services must satisfy the needs and desires of our customers, whose preferences may change in the future. For example, our proof of concept initiatives that seek to position our stores in the United States as convenient neighborhood health destinations for healthcare and retail products and services reflect the perceived desires and needs of our target market. However, it is difficult to predict consistently and successfully the products and services our customers will demand. If we misjudge either the demand for products and services we sell or our customers purchasing habits and tastes, we may be faced with excess inventories of some products and missed opportunities for products and services we chose not to offer. In addition, our sales may decline or we may be required to sell the merchandise we have obtained at lower prices. Failure to timely identify or effectively respond to changing consumer tastes, preferences and spending patterns and evolving demographic mixes in the markets we serve could negatively affect our relationship with our customers and the demand for our products and services, which could materially and adversely impact our results of operations. Our private brand offerings expose us to various additional risks. In addition to brand name products, we offer our customers private brand products that in many instances, are not available from other retailers. We seek to continue to grow our private brand offerings as part of our growth strategy, including through - 20 - the offering of No7, the introduction of Complete Home and other brands owned or licensed on an exclusive basis, as well as through selective acquisitions. Maintaining consistent product quality, competitive pricing, and availability of our private brand offerings for our customers, as well as the timely development and introduction of new products, is important in differentiating us from other retailers and developing and maintaining customer loyalty. The expansion of our private brand offerings also subjects us to additional risks, such as potential product liability risks and mandatory or voluntary product recalls; our ability to successfully protect our proprietary rights and successfully navigate and avoid claims related to the proprietary rights of third parties; our ability to successfully administer and comply with applicable contractual obligations and regulatory requirements; and other risks generally encountered by entities that source, sell and market exclusive branded offerings for retail. An increase in sales of our private brands may also adversely affect sales of our vendors products, which, in turn, could adversely affect our relationship with certain of our vendors. Any failure to adequately address some or all of these risks could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, business operations, results of operations and financial condition. We face significant competition in attracting and retaining talented employees. Further, managing succession for, and retention of, key executives is critical to our success, and failure to do so could have an adverse impact on our future performance.  Our ability to attract, engage and retain qualified and experienced employees, including in executive and other key strategic positions, is essential to meet current and future goals and objectives and there is no guarantee we will be able to attract and retain such employees by offering market competitive compensation, opportunities, empowerment and resources. There can be no assurance that competition among potential employers will not result in increased salaries or other benefits. An inability to retain existing employees or attract additional employees, or an unexpected loss of leadership or loss of key personnel, could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.  In addition, failure to adequately plan for succession of senior management and other key management roles or the failure of key employees to successfully transition into new roles could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. While we have succession plans in place and employment arrangements with certain key executives, these do not guarantee the services of these executives will continue to be available to us. We are subject to payment-related and other financial services risks that could increase our operating costs, expose us to fraud or theft, subject us to potential liability and potentially disrupt our business operations. We accept payments using a variety of methods, including cash, checks, credit and debit cards, gift cards and mobile payment technologies such as Apple Pay, and we may offer new payment options over time. Acceptance of these payment options subjects us to rules, regulations, contractual obligations and compliance requirements, including payment network rules and operating guidelines, data security standards and certification requirements, and rules governing electronic funds transfers. These requirements and related interpretations may change over time, which could make compliance more difficult or costly. For certain payment methods, including credit and debit cards, we pay interchange and other fees, which could increase over time and raise our operating costs. We rely on third parties to provide payment processing services, including the processing of credit cards, debit cards, and other forms of electronic payment. If these companies become unable to provide these services to us, or if their systems are compromised, it could disrupt our business. The payment methods that we offer also subject us to potential fraud and theft by persons who seek to obtain unauthorized access to or exploit any weaknesses that may exist in the payment systems. If we fail to comply with applicable rules or requirements, or if data is compromised due to a breach or misuse of data relating to our payment systems, we may be liable for costs incurred by payment card issuing banks and other third parties or subject to fines and higher transaction fees, or our ability to accept or facilitate certain types of payments could be impaired. In addition, our reputation could suffer and our customers could lose confidence in certain payment types, which could result in higher costs and/or reduced sales and materially and adversely affect our results of operations. Additionally, we offer money (wire) transfer services and sell prepaid debit, credit and gift cards at certain business units. These products and services require us to comply with global anti-money laundering laws and regulations. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations could result in fines, sanctions, penalties and damage to our reputation. Changes in healthcare regulatory environments may adversely affect our businesses. Political, economic and regulatory influences are subjecting the healthcare industry to significant changes that could adversely affect our results of operations. In recent years, the healthcare industry has undergone significant changes in an effort to reduce costs and government spending. These changes include an increased reliance on managed care; cuts in certain Medicare and Medicaid funding in the United States and the funding of governmental payers in foreign jurisdictions; consolidation of competitors, suppliers and other market participants; and the development of large, sophisticated purchasing groups. We expect the healthcare industry to continue to change significantly in the future. Some of these potential changes, such as a reduction in - 21 - governmental funding for certain healthcare services or adverse changes in legislation or regulations governing prescription drug pricing, healthcare services or mandated benefits, may cause customers to reduce the amount of our products and services they purchase or the price they are willing to pay for our products and services. We expect continued governmental and private payer pressure to reduce pharmaceutical pricing. Changes in pharmaceutical manufacturers pricing or distribution policies could also significantly reduce our profitability. In the United States, electoral results and changes in political leadership have generated uncertainty with respect to, and could result in, significant changes in legislation, regulation and government policy that could significantly impact our businesses and the health care and retail industries. There have been multiple attempts to repeal, modify or otherwise invalidate all, or certain provisions of, the ACA, which was enacted in 2010 to provide health insurance coverage to millions of previously uninsured Americans through a combination of insurance market reforms, an expansion of Medicaid, subsidies and health insurance mandates. We cannot predict whether current or future efforts to modify these laws and/or adopt new healthcare legislation will be successful, nor can we predict the impact that such a development would have on our business and operating results. Future legislation or rulemaking or other regulatory actions or developments under the ACA or otherwise could adversely impact the number of Americans with health insurance and, consequently, prescription drug coverage, increase regulation of pharmacy services, result in changes to pharmacy reimbursement rates, and otherwise change the way we do business. We cannot predict the timing or impact of any future legislative, rulemaking or other regulatory actions, but any such actions could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations. We could be adversely affected by product liability, product recall, personal injury or other health and safety issues. We could be adversely impacted by the supply of defective or expired products, including the infiltration of counterfeit products into the supply chain, errors in re-labeling of products, product tampering, product recall and contamination or product mishandling issues. Through our pharmacies and specialist packaging sites, including through services provided by third-party health care providers, we are also exposed to risks relating to the services we offer. Errors in the dispensing and packaging of pharmaceuticals, including related counseling, and in the provision of other healthcare services could lead to serious injury or death. Product liability or personal injury claims may be asserted against us with respect to any of the products or pharmaceuticals we sell or services we provide. For example, from time to time, the FDA issues statements alerting patients that products in our supply chain may contain impurities or harmful substances, and claims relating to the sale or distribution of such products may be asserted against us or arise from these statements. Our healthcare clinics also increase our exposure to professional liability claims related to medical care. Should a product or other liability issue arise, the coverage limits under our insurance programs and the indemnification amounts available to us may not be adequate to protect us against claims and judgments. We also may not be able to maintain this insurance on acceptable terms in the future. We could suffer significant reputational damage and financial liability if we, or any affiliated entities or third-party healthcare providers that we do business with, experience any of the foregoing health and safety issues or incidents, which could have a material adverse effect on our business operations, financial condition and results of operations. We have significant outstanding debt; our debt and associated payment obligations could significantly increase in the future if we incur additional debt and do not retire existing debt. We have outstanding debt and other financial obligations and significant unused borrowing capacity. As of August 31, 2019 , we had approximately $17 billion of outstanding indebtedness, including short-term debt. Our debt level and related debt service obligations could have negative consequences, including: ##TABLE_START  requiring us to dedicate significant cash flow from operations to the payment of principal, interest and other amounts payable on our debt, which would reduce the funds we have available for other purposes, such as working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, share repurchases and dividends; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  making it more difficult or expensive for us to obtain any necessary future financing for working capital, capital expenditures, debt service requirements, debt refinancing, acquisitions or other purposes; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  reducing our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our industry and market conditions and making us more vulnerable in the event of a downturn in our business operations; and ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  exposing us to interest rate risk given that a portion of our debt obligations is at variable interest rates. ##TABLE_END We may incur or assume significantly more debt in the future, including in connection with acquisitions, strategic investments or joint ventures. If we add new debt and do not retire existing debt, the risks described above could increase. - 22 - We also could be adversely impacted by any failure to renew or replace, on terms acceptable to us or at all, existing funding arrangements when they expire, and any failure to satisfy applicable covenants. Additionally, a portion of our indebtedness bears interest at fluctuating interest rates, some of which is tied to the London interbank offered rate for deposits of U.S. dollars (LIBOR). LIBOR tends to fluctuate based on general interest rates, rates set by the Federal Reserve and other central banks, the supply of and demand for credit in the London interbank market and general economic conditions. In July 2017, the United Kingdom Financial Conduct Authority, which regulates LIBOR, announced that it intends to stop compelling banks to submit rates for the calculation of LIBOR after 2021. The expected phase out of LIBOR could cause market volatility or disruption and may adversely affect our access to the capital markets and cost of funding. Our long-term debt obligations include covenants that may adversely affect our ability, and the ability of certain of our subsidiaries, to incur certain secured indebtedness or engage in certain types of transactions. In addition, our existing credit agreements require us to maintain as of the last day of each fiscal quarter a ratio of consolidated debt to total capitalization not to exceed a certain level. Our ability to comply with these restrictions and covenants may be affected by events beyond our control. If we breach any of these restrictions or covenants and do not obtain a waiver from the lenders, then, subject to applicable cure periods, our outstanding indebtedness could be declared immediately due and payable. This could have a material adverse effect on our business operations and financial condition. We could be adversely affected by downgrades to our credit ratings or disruptions in our ability to access well-functioning capital markets. Historically, we have relied on the public debt capital markets to fund portions of our capital investments and access to the commercial paper market and bank credit facilities as part of our working capital management strategy. Our continued access to these markets, and the terms of such access, depend on multiple factors including the condition of debt capital markets, our operating performance, and our credit ratings. The major credit rating agencies have assigned us and our corporate debt investment grade credit ratings. These ratings are based on a number of factors, which include their assessment of our financial strength and financial policies. We benefit from investment grade ratings as they serve to lower our borrowing costs and facilitate our access to a variety of lenders and other creditors, including landlords for our leased stores, on terms that we consider advantageous to our businesses. However, there can be no assurance that any particular rating assigned to us will remain in effect for any given period of time or that a rating will not be changed or withdrawn by a rating agency, if in that rating agencys judgment, future circumstances relating to the basis of the rating so warrant. For more information on our ratings, see Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Liquidity and Capital Resources - Credit Ratings. Incurrence of additional debt by us and our operating performance could adversely affect our credit ratings. We depend on banks and other financial institutions to provide credit to our business and perform under our agreements with them. Defaults by one or more of these counterparties on their obligations to us could materially and adversely affect us. Any disruptions or turmoil in the capital markets or any downgrade of our credit ratings could adversely affect our cost of funds, liquidity, competitive position and access to capital markets and increase the cost of and counterparty risks associated with existing facilities, which could materially and adversely affect our business operations, financial condition, and results of operations. We may be unable to keep existing store locations or open new locations in desirable places on favorable terms, which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations. We compete with other retailers and businesses for suitable locations for our stores. Local land use and zoning regulations, environmental regulations and other regulatory requirements may impact our ability to find suitable locations and influence the cost of constructing, renovating and operating our stores. In addition, real estate, zoning, construction and other delays may adversely affect store openings and renovations and increase our costs. Further, changing local demographics at existing store locations may adversely affect revenue and profitability levels at those stores. The termination or expiration of leases at existing store locations may adversely affect us if the renewal terms of those leases are unacceptable to us and we are forced to close or relocate stores. For example, in fiscal 2019, we announced the closure of approximately 200 locations in the United States and approximately 200 stores in the United Kingdom, respectively, under our Transformational Cost Management Program. If we determine to close or relocate a store subject to a lease, we may remain obligated under the applicable lease for the balance of the lease term. If we are unable to maintain our existing store locations or open new locations in desirable places and on favorable terms, our results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. As a holding company, Walgreens Boots Alliance is dependent on funding from its operating subsidiaries to pay dividends and other obligations. - 23 - Walgreens Boots Alliance is a holding company with no business operations of its own. Its assets primarily consist of direct and indirect ownership interests in, and its business is conducted through, subsidiaries which are separate legal entities. As a result, it is dependent on funding from its subsidiaries, including Walgreens and Alliance Boots, to meet its obligations. Additionally, Walgreens Boots Alliances subsidiaries may be restricted in their ability to pay cash dividends or to make other distributions to Walgreens Boots Alliance, which may limit the payment of cash dividends or other distributions to the holders of Walgreens Boots Alliance common stock. Credit facilities and other debt obligations of Walgreens Boots Alliance, as well as statutory provisions, may further limit the ability of Walgreens Boots Alliance and its subsidiaries to pay dividends. Payments to Walgreens Boots Alliance by its subsidiaries are also contingent upon its subsidiaries earnings and business considerations. Future Walgreens Boots Alliance dividends will be determined based on earnings, capital requirements, financial condition and other factors considered relevant by its Board of Directors. Our quarterly results may fluctuate significantly. Our operating results have historically varied on a quarterly basis, including increased variability in the second quarter of fiscal 2019, and may continue to fluctuate significantly in the future. Factors that may affect our quarterly operating results, some of which are beyond the control of management, include, but are not limited to the timing of the introduction of new generic and brand name prescription drugs; inflation, including with respect to generic drug procurement costs; seasonality, including the timing and severity of the cough, cold and flu season; changes or rates of change in payer reimbursement rates and terms; fluctuations in inventory, energy, transportation, labor, healthcare and other costs; significant acquisitions, dispositions, joint ventures and other strategic initiatives; asset impairment charges, including the performance of and impairment charges related to our equity method investments; the relative magnitude of our LIFO provision in any particular quarter; foreign currency fluctuations; market conditions, including any impact relating to Brexit; prolonged severe weather in key markets; and many of the other risk factors discussed herein. Accordingly, we believe that quarter-to-quarter comparisons of our operating results are not necessarily meaningful and investors should not place undue reliance on the results of any particular quarter as an indication of our future performance. Our businesses are seasonal in nature, and adverse events during the holiday and cough, cold and flu seasons could adversely impact our operating results. Our businesses are seasonal in nature, with the second fiscal quarter (December, January and February) typically generating a higher proportion of retail sales and earnings than other fiscal quarters. We purchase significant amounts of seasonal inventory in anticipation of the holiday season. Adverse events, such as deteriorating economic conditions, higher unemployment, higher gas prices, public transportation disruptions, or unanticipated adverse weather, could result in lower-than-planned sales during key selling seasons. For example, frequent or unusually heavy snowfall, ice storms, rainstorms, windstorms or other extreme weather conditions over a prolonged period could make it difficult for our customers to travel to our stores and increase our snow removal and other costs. This could lead to lower sales or to unanticipated markdowns, negatively impacting our financial condition and results of operations. In addition, both prescription and non-prescription drug sales are affected by the timing and severity of the cough, cold and flu season, which can vary considerably from year to year. We could be adversely impacted by changes in accounting standards and subjective assumptions, estimates and judgments by management related to complex accounting matters. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) and related accounting pronouncements, implementation guidelines and interpretations with regard to a wide range of matters that are relevant to our businesses, including, but not limited to, revenue recognition, asset impairment, impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets, inventories, equity method investments, vendor rebates and other vendor consideration, lease obligations, self-insurance liabilities, pension and postretirement benefits, tax matters, unclaimed property laws and litigation and other contingent liabilities are highly complex and involve many subjective assumptions, estimates and judgments. Changes in these rules or their interpretation or changes in underlying assumptions, estimates or judgments could significantly change our reported or expected financial performance or financial condition. For example, changes in accounting standards and the application of existing accounting standards particularly related to the measurement of fair value as compared to carrying value for the Companys reporting units, including goodwill, intangible assets and investments in equity interests, may have an adverse effect on the Companys financial condition and results of operations. Factors that could lead to impairment of goodwill and intangible assets include significant adverse changes in the business climate and declines in the financial condition of a reporting unit. Factors that could lead to impairment of investments in equity interests of the companies in which we invested include a prolonged period of decline in their operating performance or adverse changes in the economic, regulatory and legal environments of the countries in which they operate. - 24 - New accounting guidance also may require changes to our processes, accounting systems and internal controls that could increase our operating costs and/or significantly change our financial statements. For example, in February 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842), which supersedes Topic 840, Leases. This ASU, which became effective for us beginning on September 1, 2019 (fiscal 2020), seeks to increase the transparency and comparability of organizations by recognizing operating lease assets and operating lease liabilities on the balance sheet and disclosing key information about leasing arrangements. The adoption approach for these accounting standards affect the comparability of our consolidated financial statements. Implementing new accounting guidance may require us to make significant changes to and investments in our accounting systems and processes, which could result in significant adverse changes to our financial statements. See, new accounting pronouncements, within note 1 , summary of major accounting policies , to the Consolidated Financial Statements. We have a substantial amount of goodwill and other intangible assets which could, in the future, become impaired and result in material non-cash charges to our results of operations. As of August 31, 2019 , we had $27.4 billion of goodwill and other intangible assets on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. We evaluate this goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment annually during the fourth quarter, or more frequently if an event occurs or circumstances change that could more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit or indefinite-lived intangible asset below its carrying value. As part of this impairment analysis, we determine fair value for each reporting unit using both the income and market approaches. We determine fair value of indefinite-lived intangible assets using the relief from royalty method and excess earnings method of the income approach. Definite-lived intangible assets are evaluated for impairment if an event occurs or circumstances change that indicate the carrying amount may not be recoverable. Estimated fair values could change if, for example, there are changes in the business climate, changes in the competitive environment, adverse legal or regulatory actions or developments, changes in capital structure, cost of debt and equity, capital expenditure levels, operating cash flows, or market capitalization. For example, during the three months ended August 31, 2019, we completed quantitative impairment analysis for goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets as of a June 1, 2019 valuation date. Based on this analysis, the fair value of the Boots reporting unit, within the Retail Pharmacy International segment, is in excess of its carrying value by approximately 9% . As at August 31, 2019 , the carrying value of the goodwill of the Boots reporting unit is $2.6 billion . The fair values of certain indefinite-lived intangibles within the Boots reporting unit exceeded their carrying amounts ranging from approximately 3% to approximately 29% , except for the pharmacy licenses. As at August 31, 2019 , the carrying value of these indefinite-lived intangibles within Boots reporting unit is $6.9 billion . As a result of an annual evaluation, during the three months ended August 31, 2019 , the Company recorded an impairment of $73 million on its pharmacy licenses in the Boots reporting unit. Because of the significance of our goodwill and intangible assets, any future impairment of these assets could result in material non-cash charges to our results of operations, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. We could be subject to adverse changes in tax laws, regulations and interpretations or challenges to our tax positions. We are a large corporation with operations in the United States and numerous other jurisdictions around the world. As such, we are subject to tax laws and regulations of the U.S. federal, state and local governments as well as various foreign jurisdictions. We compute our income tax provision based on enacted tax rates in the jurisdictions in which we operate. As the tax rates vary among jurisdictions, a change in earnings attributable to the various jurisdictions in which we operate could result in an unfavorable change in our overall tax provision. From time to time, changes in tax laws or regulations may be proposed or enacted that could adversely affect our overall tax liability. For example, the U.S. tax legislation enacted on December 22, 2017 represented a significant overhaul of the U.S. federal tax code that impacted our U.S. federal income tax position. There can be no assurance that changes in tax laws or regulations, both within the United States and the other jurisdictions in which we operate, will not materially and adversely affect our effective tax rate, tax payments, financial condition and results of operations. Similarly, changes in tax laws and regulations that impact our customers and counterparties or the economy generally may also impact our financial condition and results of operations. Tax laws and regulations are complex and subject to varying interpretations, and we are subject to regular review and audit by both domestic and foreign tax authorities. Any adverse outcome of such a review or audit could have a negative impact on our effective tax rate, tax payments, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, the determination of our income tax provision and other tax liabilities requires significant judgment, and there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. The ultimate tax determination may differ from the amounts recorded in our financial statements and may materially affect our results of operations in the period or periods for which such determination is made. Any significant failure to comply with applicable tax laws and regulations in all relevant jurisdictions could give rise to substantial penalties and liabilities. Any changes in enacted tax laws (such as the recent U.S. tax legislation), rules or regulatory - 25 - or judicial interpretations; or any change in the pronouncements relating to accounting for income taxes could materially and adversely impact our effective tax rate, tax payments, financial condition and results of operations. Our insurance strategies may expose us to unexpected costs. We use a combination of insurance and self-insurance to provide for potential liability for workers compensation; automobile and general liability; property, director and officers liability; and employee healthcare benefits. Provisions for losses related to self-insured risks generally are based upon actuarially determined estimates. Any actuarial projection of losses is subject to a high degree of variability. Substantial, unanticipated losses or liabilities, including those due to natural disasters or otherwise, as well as changes in legal claims, trends and interpretations, variability in inflation rates, changes in the nature and method of claims settlement, benefit level changes due to changes in applicable laws, insolvency of insurance carriers, and changes in discount rates could all materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. We could be adversely impacted by changes in assumptions used in calculating pension assets and liabilities. We operate certain defined benefit pension plans in the United Kingdom, which were closed to new entrants in 2010, as well as smaller plans in other jurisdictions. The valuation of the pension plans assets and liabilities depends in part on assumptions, which are primarily based on the financial markets as well as longevity and employee retention rates. This valuation is particularly sensitive to material changes in the value of equity, bond and other investments held by the pension plans, changes in the corporate bond yields which are used in the measurement of the liabilities, changes in market expectations for long-term price inflation, and new evidence on projected longevity rates. Funding requirements and the impact on the statement of earnings relating to these pension plans are also influenced by these factors. Adverse changes in the assumptions used to calculate the value of pension assets and liabilities, including lower than expected pension fund investment returns and/or increased life expectancy of plan participants, or regulatory change could require us to increase the funding of its defined benefit pension plans or incur higher expenses, which would adversely impact our results of operations and financial position. Certain stockholders may have significant voting influence over matters requiring stockholder approval. As of September 30, 2019, affiliates of Stefano Pessina, our Executive Vice Chairman and Chief Executive Officer (the SP Investors), had sole or shared voting power, directly or indirectly, over an aggregate of approximately 16.2% of our outstanding common stock. The SP Investors have agreed to, for so long as they have the right to designate a nominee for election to the Board, to vote all of their shares of common stock in accordance with the Boards recommendation on matters submitted to a vote of the Companys stockholders (including with respect to the election of directors). The SP Investors significant interest in our common stock potentially could determine the outcome of matters submitted to a vote by our stockholders. The influence of the SP Investors could result in the Company taking actions that other stockholders do not support or failing to take actions that other stockholders support. As a result, the market price of our common stock could be adversely affected. Conflicts of interest, or the appearance of conflicts of interest, may arise because certain of our directors and officers are also owners or directors of companies we may have dealings with. Conflicts of interest, or the appearance of conflicts of interest, could arise between our interests and the interests of the other entities and business activities in which our directors or officers are involved. For example, potential conflicts of interest could arise if a dispute were to arise between the Company and other parties to the Company Shareholders Agreement (as defined herein), including the SP Investors. Mr. Pessina, our Executive Vice Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, indirectly controls Alliance Sant Participations S.A. (ASP), a privately-held company which is a party to the Company Shareholders Agreement, and he and his partner Ornella Barra, our Co-Chief Operating Officer, serve as directors of ASP. There are other arrangements between affiliates of Mr. Pessina and the Company, with required disclosures included in the Companys annual proxy statement, including with respect to Alliance Healthcare Italia SpA, which is an entity indirectly owned and controlled by Mr. Pessina and in which the Company has an indirect 9% interest, which operates Boots branded stores in Italy. Conflicts of interest, or the appearance of conflicts of interest, or similar issues could arise in connection with these or other transactions in the future. While our contractual arrangements place restrictions on the parties conduct in certain situations, and related party transactions are subject to independent review and approval in accordance with our related party transaction approval procedures and applicable law, the potential for a conflict of interest exists and such persons may have conflicts of interest, or the appearance of conflicts of interest, with respect to matters involving or affecting both companies. Our certificate of incorporation and bylaws, Delaware law and/or our agreements with certain stockholders may impede the ability of our stockholders to make changes to our Board or impede a takeover. - 26 - Certain provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws, as well as provisions of the Delaware General Corporation Law (the DGCL), could make it difficult for stockholders to change the composition of the Board or discourage, delay, or prevent a merger, consolidation, or acquisitions that stockholders may otherwise consider favorable. These provisions include the authorization of the issuance of blank check preferred stock that could be issued by the Board, limitations on the ability of stockholders to call special meetings, and advance notice requirements for nomination for election to the Board or for proposing matters that can be acted upon by stockholders at stockholder meetings. We are also subject to the provisions of Section 203 of the DGCL, which prohibits us, except under specified circumstances, from engaging in any mergers, significant sales of stock or assets, or business combinations with any stockholder or group of stockholders who own 15% or more of our common stock. Under the Company Shareholders Agreement, the SP Investors are entitled to designate one nominee to the Board (currently Stefano Pessina) for so long as the SP Investors continue to meet certain beneficial ownership thresholds and subject to certain other conditions. Pursuant to the Company Shareholders Agreement, the SP Investors have agreed that, for so long as they have the right to designate a nominee to the Board, they will vote all of their shares of common stock in accordance with the Boards recommendation on matters submitted to a vote of our stockholders (including with respect to the election of directors). While these provisions do not make us immune from takeovers or changes in the composition of the Board, and are intended to protect our stockholders from, among other things, coercive or otherwise unfair tactics, these provisions could have the effect of making it difficult for stockholders to change the composition of the Board or discouraging, delaying, or preventing a merger, consolidation, or acquisitions that stockholders may otherwise consider favorable. We cannot guarantee that our stock repurchase program will be fully implemented or that it will enhance long-term stockholder value. In June 2018, our Board of Directors approved a new stock repurchase program authorizing the repurchase of up to $10 billion of our common stock. The repurchase program does not have an expiration date and we are not obligated to repurchase a specified number or dollar value of shares, on any particular timetable or at all. There can be no assurance that we will repurchase stock at favorable prices. The repurchase program may be suspended or terminated at any time and, even if fully implemented, may not enhance long-term stockholder value. The market price of our common stock may be volatile. The market price of shares of our common stock may be volatile. Broad general economic, political, market and industry factors may adversely affect the market price of the shares, regardless of our actual operating performance. In addition to the other risk factors identified in this Item 1A, factors that could cause fluctuations in the price of the shares include: ##TABLE_START  actual or anticipated variations in quarterly operating results and the results of competitors; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  changes in financial estimates by us or by any securities analysts that might cover us; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  conditions or trends in the industry, including regulatory changes or changes in the securities marketplace; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  announcements by us or our competitors of significant acquisitions, strategic partnerships or divestitures; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  announcements of investigations or regulatory scrutiny of our operations or lawsuits filed against us; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  additions or departures of key personnel; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  issuances or sales of our common stock (or the exercise of related registration rights), including sales of shares by our directors and officers or key investors, including the SP Investors and certain other former Alliance Boots stockholders, subject to restrictions in the case of shares held by persons deemed to be our affiliates and to certain obligations pursuant to a shareholders agreement (as amended, the Company Shareholders Agreement) with certain of the SP Investors; and ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  various other market factors or perceived market factors, including rumors or speculation, whether or not correct, involving or affecting us or our industries, vendors, customers, strategic partners or competitors. ##TABLE_END There are a number of additional business risks that could materially and adversely affect our businesses and financial results. - 27 - Many other factors could materially and adversely affect our businesses and financial results, including: ##TABLE_START  our ability to establish effective advertising, marketing and promotional programs; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  inflation, new or increased taxes, adverse fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, changes in market conditions or otherwise; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  natural disasters, civil unrest, severe weather conditions, terrorist activities, global political and economic developments, war, health epidemics or pandemics or the prospect of these events; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  liabilities or expense relating to the protection of the environment, related health and safety matters, environmental remediation or compliance with environmental laws and regulations, including those governing exposure to, and the management and disposal of, hazardous substances; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  the long-term effects of climate change on general economic conditions and the pharmacy industry in particular, along with changes in the supply, demand or available sources of energy and the regulatory and other costs associated with energy production and delivery; ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  adverse publicity and potential losses, liabilities and reputational harm stemming from any public incident (whether occurring online, in social media, in our stores or other company facilities, or elsewhere) involving our company, our personnel or our brands, including any such public incident involving our customers, products, services, stores or other property, or those of any of our vendors or other parties with which we do business; and ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START  negative publicity, even if unwarranted, related to safety or quality, human and workplace rights, or other issues damaging our brand image and corporate reputation, or that of any of our vendors or strategic allies. ##TABLE_END ", "1B": " Item 1B.

The impact on our previously reported net periodic costs as a result of the retrospective adoption of this standard results in a reclassification from selling, general and administrative expenses to other income (expense) of $125 million , $73 million , $(69) million and $(51) million for the fiscal years ended August 31, 2018, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START 2  Effective March 18, 2016, the Company began accounting for its investment in AmerisourceBergen using the equity method of accounting, subject to a two-month reporting lag. Due to the March 18, 2016 effective date and the two-month reporting lag, the Companys results for the 12 month period ended August 31, 2016 include approximately three and a half months of equity method income relating to its investment in AmerisourceBergen. Similarly, results for the 12 month period ended August 31, 2017 include approximately ten and a half months of equity income reflecting the Companys increased ownership following the exercise on August 25, 2016 of the second tranche of warrants. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START 3  On August 2, 2012, the Company completed the acquisition of 45% of the issued and outstanding share capital of Alliance Boots in exchange for cash and Company shares. The Company accounted for this investment under the equity method until it completed the acquisition of the remaining 55% of Alliance Boots on December 31, 2014. As a result, fiscal 2015 includes the results of Alliance Boots for eight months (January through August 2015) on a fully consolidated basis and four months (September through December 2014) as equity earnings in Alliance Boots reflecting Walgreens pre-merger 45% interest. ##TABLE_END- 33 - ##TABLE_START 4  In fiscal 2015, as a result of acquiring the remaining 55% interest in Alliance Boots, the Companys previously held 45% interest was remeasured to fair value, resulting in a gain of $563 million. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START 5  Fiscal 2019 primarily reflects gain recognition resulting from the termination of the option granted to Rite Aid to become a member of the Companys group purchasing organization. Fiscal 2018 includes the gain on sale of the Companys equity interest in Premise Health Holding Corp., partially offset by the impairment of the Companys equity method investment in Guangzhou Pharmaceuticals Corporation. In fiscal 2016 and 2015, the Company recorded other income (expense) of $(517) million and $779 million, respectively, from fair value adjustments of the AmerisourceBergen warrants and the amortization of the deferred credit associated with the initial value of the warrants. Fiscal 2016 also includes income of $268 million related to the change in accounting method for the Companys investment in AmerisourceBergen. Fiscal 2015 also includes a $94 million loss on derivative contracts that were not designated as accounting hedges. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START 6  To improve comparability, certain classification changes were made to prior period sales, cost of sales and selling, general and administrative expenses. These changes had no impact on operating income. The reclassifications were made in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016. ##TABLE_END- 34 - ", "7": " Item 7. Managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations The following discussion and analysis of the Companys financial condition and results of operations should be read together with the financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere herein and the description of the Companys business and reportable segments in item 1 above. This discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results may differ materially from those discussed in forward-looking statements. Factors that might cause a difference include, but are not limited to, those discussed under cautionary note regarding forward-looking statements below and in risk factors in part I, item 1A of this Form 10-K. References herein to the Company, we, us, or our refer to Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. and its subsidiaries, and in each case do not include unconsolidated partially-owned entities, except as otherwise indicated or the context otherwise requires. Certain amounts in the Consolidated Financial Statements and associated notes may not add due to rounding. All percentages have been calculated using unrounded amounts for fiscal 2019. INTRODUCTION AND SEGMENTS Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. (Walgreens Boots Alliance) and its subsidiaries are a global leader in retail and wholesale pharmacy . Its operations are conducted through three reportable segments: ##TABLE_START  Retail Pharmacy USA; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Retail Pharmacy International; and ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Pharmaceutical Wholesale ##TABLE_END See note 16 , segment reporting and note 17 , sales further information. FACTORS AFFECTING OUR RESULTS AND COMPARABILITY The Company has been, and we expect it to continue to be, affected by a number of factors that may cause actual results to differ from our current expectations. These factors include: financial performance of our equity method investees, including AmerisourceBergen; the influence of certain holidays; seasonality; foreign currency rates; changes in vendor, payer and customer relationships and terms and associated reimbursement pressure; strategic transactions and acquisitions, including the acquisition of stores and other assets from Rite Aid; joint ventures and other strategic collaborations; changes in laws, including the U.S. tax law changes; changes in trade, tariffs, including trade relations between the United States and China, and international relations, including the UK's proposed withdrawal from the European Union and its impact on our operations and prospects and those of our customers and counterparties; the timing and magnitude of cost reduction initiatives, including under our Transformational Cost Management Program (as defined below); fluctuations in variable costs; and general economic conditions in the markets in which the Company operates. These and other factors can affect the Companys operations and net earnings for any period and may cause such results not to be comparable to the same period in previous years. The results presented in this report are not necessarily indicative of future operating results. TRANSFORMATIONAL COST MANAGEMENT PROGRAM On December 20, 2018, the Company announced a transformational cost management program that is expected to deliver in excess of $1.5 billion of annual cost savings by fiscal 2022 (the Transformational Cost Management Program). As of the date of this report, the Company now expects to deliver in excess of $1.8 billion of annual cost savings by fiscal 2022 . The Transformational Cost Management Program, which is multi-faceted and includes divisional optimization initiatives, global smart spending, global smart organization and the transformation of the Companys information technology (IT) capabilities, is designed to help the Company achieve increased cost efficiencies. To date, the Company has taken initial actions across all aspects of the Transformational Cost Management Program. The actions under the Transformational Cost Management Program focus on all reportable segments and the Companys global functions. Divisional optimization within each of the Companys segments includes activities such as optimization of stores which includes plans to close approximately 200 stores in the United Kingdom and approximately 200 locations in the United States. The Company currently estimates that the Transformational Cost Management Program will result in cumulative pre-tax charges to its GAAP financial results of approximately $1.9 billion to $2.4 billion , of which $1.6 billion to $2.0 billion are expected to be recorded as exit and disposal activities. The Company estimates that approximately 80% of the cumulative pre-tax charges relating to the Transformational Cost Management Program will result in future cash expenditures, primarily related to lease and other real estate payments, employee severance and technology costs related to the Companys IT transformation. The Company currently estimates that it will recognize aggregate pre-tax charges to its GAAP financial results related to Transformational Cost Management Program as follows: - 35 - ##TABLE_START Transformational Cost Program Activities Range of Charges Lease obligations and other real estate costs $200 to 300 million Asset impairments 1 $400 to 500 million Employee severance and business transition costs $600 to 700 million Information technology transformation and other exit costs $400 to 500 million Total cumulative pre-tax exit and disposal charges $1.6 to 2.0 billion Other IT transformation costs $300 to 400 million Total estimated pre-tax charges $1.9 to 2.4 billion ##TABLE_END1 Primarily related to asset write-offs from store closures, information technology and other asset write-offs. In addition to the impacts discussed above, as a result of the actions related to store closures taken under the Transformational Cost Management Program, the Company expects to record $508 million of transition adjustments to decrease retained earnings due to the adoption of the new lease accounting standard (Topic 842) that became effective on September 1, 2019. See note 1, summary of major accounting policies, for additional information. Since the approval of the Transformational Cost Management Program, the Company has recognized aggregate cumulative pre-tax charges to its financial results in accordance with GAAP of $477 million , of which $432 million are recorded as exit and disposal activities. See note 3, exit and disposal activities, for additional information. Costs under the Transformational Cost Management Program, which were primarily recorded in selling, general and administrative expenses and included in the fiscal year ended August 31, 2019 were as follows (in millions): ##TABLE_START Twelve Months Ended August 31, 2019 Retail Pharmacy USA  Retail Pharmacy International  Pharmaceutical Wholesale  Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. Lease obligations and other real estate costs $  $  $  $ Asset impairments 1    Employee severance and business transition costs    Information technology transformation and other exit costs    Total pre-tax exit and disposal charges $  $  $  $ Other IT transformation costs    Total pre-tax charges $  $  $  $ ##TABLE_END1 Primarily includes write down of leasehold improvements, certain software and inventory. Transformational Cost Management Program charges are recognized as the costs are incurred over time in accordance with GAAP. The Company treats charges related to the Transformational Cost Management Program as special items impacting comparability of results in its earnings disclosures. The amounts and timing of all estimates are subject to change until finalized. The actual amounts and timing may vary materially based on various factors. See cautionary note regarding forward-looking statements below. ACQUISITION OF CERTAIN RITE AID ASSETS On September 19, 2017, the Company announced it had secured regulatory clearance for an amended and restated asset purchase agreement to purchase 1,932 stores, three distribution centers and related inventory from Rite Aid for $4.375 billion in cash and other consideration. The Company has completed the acquisition of all 1,932 Rite Aid stores and the first distribution center and related inventory, while the transition of the remaining two distribution centers and related inventory remains subject to closing conditions set forth in the amended and restated asset purchase agreement. The Company expects to complete integration of the acquired stores and related assets by the end of fiscal 2020, at an estimated total cost of approximately $850 million, which is reported as acquisition-related costs. The Company has recognized cumulative pre-tax charges for the fiscal year 2019 and 2018 of $295 million and $221 million, respectively, related to integration of the acquired stores and related assets. In addition, the Company expects to spend approximately $500 million on store conversions and related activities. The Company expects annual synergies from the transaction of more than $325 million, - 36 - which are expected to be fully realized within four years of the initial closing of this transaction and derived primarily from procurement, cost savings and other operational matters. The amounts and timing of all estimates are subject to change until finalized. The actual amounts and timing may vary materially based on various factors. See cautionary note regarding forward-looking statements below. STORE OPTIMIZATION PROGRAM On October 24, 2017, the Companys Board of Directors approved a plan to implement a program (the Store Optimization Program) to optimize store locations through the planned closure of approximately 600 stores and related assets within the Companys Retail Pharmacy USA segment upon completion of the acquisition of certain stores and related assets from Rite Aid. As of the date of this report, the Company expects to close approximately 750 stores, of which the majority have been closed as part of this program. The actions under the Store Optimization Program commenced in March 2018 and are expected to be complete by the end of fiscal 2020 . The Store Optimization Program is expected to result in cost savings of approximately $350 million per year to be fully delivered by the end of fiscal 2020 . The Company currently estimates that it will recognize cumulative pre-tax charges to its GAAP financial results of approximately $350 million , including costs associated with lease obligations and other real estate costs and employee severance and other exit costs. The Company expects to incur pre-tax charges of approximately $160 million for lease obligations and other real estate costs and approximately $190 million for employee severance and other exit costs. The Company estimates that substantially all of these cumulative pre-tax charges will result in cash expenditures. Since approval of the Store Optimization Program, the Company has recognized cumulative pre-tax charges to its GAAP financial results of $296 million , including $100 million for fiscal 2018 and $196 million for fiscal 2019 , which were primarily recorded within selling, general and administrative expenses. Cumulative pre-tax charges included $138 million related to lease obligations and other real estate costs and $158 million in employee severance and other exit costs. Store Optimization Program charges are recognized as the costs are incurred over time in accordance with GAAP. The Company treats charges related to the Store Optimization Program as special items impacting comparability of results in its earnings disclosures. The amounts and timing of all estimates are subject to change until finalized. The actual amounts and timing may vary materially based on various factors. See cautionary note regarding forward-looking statements below. U.S. TAX LAW CHANGES In connection with the U.S. tax law changes enacted in December 2017 and in accordance with SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin 118, the Company completed its analysis of the income tax effects of the U.S. tax law changes during the three months ended February 28, 2019. The incremental net tax benefit recorded upon completion of the analysis of the income tax effects of the U.S. tax law changes was not material to our Consolidated Financial Statements. While the Company completed its analysis of the income tax effects of the U.S. tax law changes, the final impact of the U.S. tax law changes may differ from this analysis, due to, among other things, technical clarifications from the U.S. Department of the Treasury and the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), interpretations of the U.S. tax law changes and actions the Company may take. The Company will continue to evaluate the impact of any future authoritative guidance with respect to the U.S. tax law changes. During 2019, the U.S. Treasury Department issued regulations to apply retroactively covering certain components of the 2017 U.S. tax law changes. Certain guidance included in these regulations is inconsistent with the Companys interpretation that led to the recognition of $247 million of tax benefits in prior periods. Despite this new guidance, the Company remains confident in its interpretation of the U.S. tax law changes and intends to defend this position through litigation, if necessary. However, if the Company is ultimately unsuccessful in defending its position, it may be required to reverse all or a portion of the benefits previously recorded. As the Company repatriates the undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries for use in the United States, the earnings from our foreign subsidiaries will generally not be subject to U.S. federal tax. The Company continuously evaluates the amount of foreign earnings that are not necessary to be permanently reinvested in our foreign subsidiaries. INVESTMENT IN AMERISOURCEBERGEN - 37 - As of August 31, 2019 , the Company owned 56,854,867 shares of AmerisourceBergen common stock (representing approximately 27% of its outstanding common stock) and may, subject to certain conditions, acquire up to an additional 8,398,752 AmerisourceBergen shares in the open market. The Company accounts for its investment in AmerisourceBergen using the equity method of accounting, subject to a two-month reporting lag, with the net earnings attributable to the investment classified within the operating income of the Companys Pharmaceutical Wholesale segment. The financial performance of AmerisourceBergen, including any charges which may arise relating to its ongoing opioid litigation, will impact the Companys results of operations. Additionally, a substantial and sustained decline in the price of AmerisourceBergens common stock could trigger an impairment evaluation of our investment. These considerations may materially and adversely affect the Companys financial condition and results of operations. For more information, see Business - Relationship with AmerisourceBergen and note 5 , equity method investments to the Consolidated Financial Statements. THE IMPACT OF BREXIT In June 2016, voters in the United Kingdom approved an advisory referendum to withdraw from the European Union, which proposed exit (and the political, economic and other uncertainties it has raised) is commonly referred to as Brexit. Since the Brexit vote in June 2016, there has been significant volatility in the global stock markets and currency exchange rates, as well as challenging market conditions in the United Kingdom. In March 2017, the United Kingdom formally started the process to leave the European Union. An original exit date was set for March 29, 2019 but following the UK parliaments rejection of a negotiated outcome, the leaders of the member countries of the European Union have agreed to multiple extensions of the deadline for Brexit and there can be no assurance regarding the terms, timing or consummation of any such arrangements. Although we continue to actively monitor the ongoing potential impacts of Brexit and will seek to minimize its impact on our business, if the UKs membership in the European Union terminates without an agreement, these conditions could continue and there could be increased costs from tariffs on trade between the United Kingdom and European Union and disruptions to the free movement of goods, services and people between the United Kingdom and the European union and other parties. Further, uncertainty around and developments regarding these and related issues has contributed to deteriorating market conditions and could further adversely impact consumer and investor confidence and the economy of the United Kingdom and the economies of other countries in which we operate and cause significant volatility in currency exchange rates. Given the lack of comparable precedent, it is unclear what financial, trade, regulatory and legal implications the withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union will have on our business, particularly European operations; however, Brexit and its related effects could have a material impact on the Companys consolidated financial position or operating results. For more information relating to this topic, see Risk Factors-Our substantial international business operations subject us to a number of operating, economic, political, regulatory and other international business risks.

For discussion related to the results of operations by segment for fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017, refer to Part II, Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in our fiscal 2018 Form 10-K, which was filed with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission on October 11, 2018. Fiscal 2019 compared to fiscal 2018  Fiscal 2019 net earnings attributable to Walgreens Boots Alliance decrease d 20.7 percent to $4.0 billion , while diluted net earnings per share decrease d 14.6 percent to $4.31 compared with the prior year. The decrease primarily reflects operating performance, including costs related to the Companys Transformational Cost Management Program, partially offset by certain legal and regulatory accruals in the prior year. Diluted net earnings per share was positively affected by a lower number of shares outstanding compared with the prior year. Net earnings and diluted earnings per share were negatively by 0.8 percentage points and 0.9 percentage points, respectively, as a result of currency translation. Other income for fiscal 2019 was $233 million compared to $302 million for fiscal 2018 . Other income for fiscal 2019 primarily reflects gains resulting from the termination of the option granted to Rite Aid to become a member of the Companys group purchasing organization. Results for fiscal 2018 primarily reflect the gain on sale of the Companys equity interest in Premise Health Holding Corp, partially offset by the impairment of the Company's equity method investment in Guangzhou Pharmaceuticals Corporation in the prior year period.  Interest was a net expense of $704 million and $616 million in fiscal 2019 and 2018 , respectively. The effective tax rate for fiscal 2019 and 2018 was 13.0% and 16.7% , respectively. The net decrease in the effective tax rate was primarily attributable to the reduced U.S. statutory tax rate as a result of the U.S tax law changes. Adjusted diluted net earnings per share (Non-GAAP measure) fiscal 2019 compared to fiscal 2018  - 39 - Adjusted net earnings attributable to Walgreens Boots Alliance in fiscal 2019  decrease d 7.6 percent to $5.5 billion compared with the prior year. Adjusted diluted net earnings per share in fiscal 2019  decrease d 0.5 percent to $5.99 compared with the prior year. Adjusted net earnings and adjusted diluted earnings per share were negatively impacted by 0.9 percentage points and 1.0 percentage points, respectively, as a result of currency translation. Excluding the impact of currency translation, the decrease in adjusted net earnings for fiscal 2019 primarily reflects a decrease in operating performance, partly offset by a decrease in the adjusted effective tax rate. Adjusted diluted net earnings per share was positively affected by a lower number of shares outstanding compared with the prior year. See --Non-GAAP Measures below for a reconciliation to the most directly comparable financial measure calculated in accordance with GAAP and related disclosures.

This adjustment reflects that these prescriptions include approximately three times the amount of product days supplied compared to a normal prescription. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START 5  Comparable stores are defined as those that have been open for at least twelve consecutive months without closure for seven or more consecutive days and without a major remodel or being subject to a natural disaster in the past twelve months. Relocated stores are not included as comparable stores for the first twelve months after the relocation. Acquired stores are not included as comparable stores for the first twelve months after acquisition or conversion, when applicable, whichever is later.

Sales in comparable stores increased by 2.0% in fiscal 2019 . The Company operated 9,285 locations ( 9,277  retail stores ) as of August 31,  2019 , compared to 9,569 locations ( 9,560  retail stores ) a year earlier. Pharmacy sales increase d by 8.6% in fiscal 2019 and represented 73.8% of the divisions sales. The increase in fiscal 2019 is due to higher brand inflation and growth in central specialty and reflects the impact of the acquired Rite Aid stores. In fiscal 2018 , pharmacy sales increased 17.2% and represented 72.2% of the divisions sales. Comparable pharmacy sales increase d 4.0% in fiscal 2019 compared to an increase of 3.4% in fiscal 2018 . The effect of generic drugs, which have a lower retail price, replacing brand name drugs reduced prescription sales by 1.2% in fiscal 2019 compared to a reduction of 1.4% in fiscal 2018 . The effect of generics on division sales was a reduction of 0.8% in fiscal 2019 compared to a reduction of 0.9% for fiscal 2018 . Third-party sales, where reimbursement is received from managed care organizations, governmental agencies, employers or private insurers, were 97.1% of prescription sales for fiscal 2019 compared to 98.3% for fiscal 2018 . The total number of prescriptions (including immunizations) filled in fiscal 2019 was 843.7 million compared to 823.1 million in fiscal 2018 .

Retail sales were flat in fiscal 2019 and were 26.2% of the divisions sales. In comparison, fiscal 2018 retail sales increase d 2.4% and comprised 27.8% of the divisions sales. Comparable retail sales decrease d 2.4% in each of fiscal 2019 and fiscal 2018 . The decrease in comparable retail sales in fiscal 2019 was primarily due to the continued de-emphasis of tobacco. Operating income fiscal 2019 compared to fiscal 2018  Retail Pharmacy USA divisions operating income for fiscal 2019  decrease d 14.6% to $4.1 billion . The decrease was primarily due to lower gross margin partially offset by a reduction in selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales. Gross margin was 22.5% in fiscal 2019 compared to 24.1% in fiscal 2018 . Gross margin was negatively impacted in the current fiscal year by pharmacy margins, which were negatively impacted by reimbursement pressure. The decrease in pharmacy margins was partially offset by the favorable impact of procurement efficiencies. Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales were 18.6% in fiscal 2019 compared to 19.3% in fiscal 2018 . As a percentage of sales, expenses in the current fiscal year were lower primarily due to a higher mix of specialty sales and lower expenses related to certain legal and regulatory accruals in the prior year. Adjusted operating income (Non-GAAP measure) fiscal 2019 compared to fiscal 2018  Retail Pharmacy USA divisions adjusted operating income for fiscal 2019  decrease d 9.6% to $5.3 billion .

These adjustments include acquisition-related amortization and acquisition-related costs and were immaterial for the prior periods presented. Although the Company may have shareholder rights and board representation commensurate with its ownership interests in these equity method investees, adjustments relating to equity method investments are not intended to imply that the Company has direct control over their operations and resulting revenue and expenses. Moreover, these non-GAAP financial measures have limitations in that they do not reflect all revenue and expenses of these equity method investees. ##TABLE_END LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Cash and cash equivalents were $1.0 billion (including $0.4 billion in non-U.S. jurisdictions) as of August 31, 2019 , compared to $0.8 billion (including $0.2 billion in non-U.S. jurisdictions) at August 31, 2018 . Short-term investment objectives are primarily to minimize risk and maintain liquidity. To attain these objectives, investment limits are placed on the amount, type and issuer of securities. Investments are principally in U.S. Treasury money market funds and AAA-rated money market funds. The Companys long-term capital policy is to maintain a strong balance sheet and financial flexibility, reinvest in its core strategies, invest in strategic opportunities that reinforce its core strategies and meet return requirements and return surplus cash flow to stockholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases over the long term. In July 2019, the Companys Board of Directors reviewed and refined the Companys dividend policy to set forth the Companys current intention to increase its dividend each year. Cash provided by operations and the incurrence of debt are the principal sources of funds for expansion, investments, acquisitions, remodeling programs, dividends to stockholders and stock repurchases. Net cash provided by operating activities was $5.6 billion in fiscal 2019 compared to $8.3 billion in fiscal 2018 and $7.3 billion in fiscal 2017 . The $2.7 billion  decrease in cash provided by operating activities includes cash outflows relating to the integration of Rite Aid stores, timing of certain legal and regulatory settlements and higher income taxes paid. Changes in income taxes paid are mainly due to the impact of U.S. tax law changes. Changes in accrued expenses and other liabilities, trade accounts payable and trade accounts receivables include cash outflows relating to the integration of Rite Aid stores. Changes in accrued expenses and other liabilities also include the impact of certain legal and regulatory settlements. Net cash used for investing activities was $2.3 billion in fiscal 2019 compared to $5.5 billion in fiscal 2018 and $0.8 billion in fiscal 2017 .

See note 5 , equity method investments , to the Consolidated Financial Statements included herein for further information. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES The information set forth in note 10 , commitments and contingencies , to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in part II, item 8 of this Form 10-K is incorporated herein by reference. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES The Consolidated Financial Statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America and include amounts based on managements prudent judgments and estimates. Actual results may differ from these estimates. Management believes that any reasonable deviation from those judgments and estimates would not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations. To the extent that the estimates used differ from actual results, however, adjustments to the Consolidated Statements of Earnings and corresponding Consolidated Balance Sheets accounts would be necessary. These adjustments would be made in future periods. Some of the more significant estimates include business combinations, goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment, cost of sales and inventory, equity method investments, pension and postretirement benefits and income taxes. The Company uses the following methods to determine its estimates:  Business combinations   The Company accounts for business combinations using the acquisition method of accounting, which requires that once control is obtained, all the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, including amounts attributable to noncontrolling interests, be recorded at their respective fair values at the date of acquisition. The determination of fair values of assets and liabilities acquired requires estimates and the use of valuation techniques when market value is not readily available. For intangible assets, the Company generally uses the income approach to determine fair value. The income approach requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions. These estimates and assumptions primarily include, but are not limited to: discount rates, terminal growth rates, royalty rates, forecasts of revenue, operating income, depreciation, amortization and capital expenditures. The discount rates applied to the projections reflect the risk factors associated with those projections. Although the Company believes its estimates of fair value are reasonable, actual financial results could differ from those estimates due to the inherent uncertainty involved in making such estimates. Changes in assumptions concerning future financial results or other underlying assumptions could have a significant impact on the determination of the fair value of the intangible assets acquired. Judgment is also required in determining the intangible assets useful life. Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment  Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are evaluated for impairment annually during the fourth quarter, or more frequently if an event occurs or circumstances change that could more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit or intangible asset below its carrying value. As part of the Companys impairment analysis, fair value of a reporting unit is determined using both the income and market approaches. The income approach requires management to estimate a number of factors for each reporting unit, including projected future operating results, economic projections, anticipated future cash flows and discount rates. The market approach estimates fair value using comparable marketplace fair value data from within a comparable industry grouping. The determination of the fair value of the reporting units requires the Company to make significant estimates and assumptions. These estimates and assumptions primarily include, but are not limited to: the selection of appropriate peer group companies, control premiums appropriate for acquisitions in the industries in which we compete, discount rates, terminal growth rates, forecasts of revenue, operating income, depreciation, amortization and capital expenditures. Although we believe our estimates of fair value are reasonable, actual financial results could differ from those estimates due to the inherent uncertainty involved in making such estimates. Changes in assumptions concerning future financial results or other underlying assumptions could have a significant impact on either the fair value of the reporting units, the amount of any goodwill impairment charge, or both. The Company also compares the sum of estimated fair values of reporting units to the Companys fair value as implied by the market value of its equity securities. This comparison provides an indication that, in total, assumptions and estimates are reasonable. Future declines in the overall market value of the Companys equity securities may provide an indication that the fair value of one or more reporting units has declined below its carrying value. - 52 - The fair values of the Companys reporting units exceeded their carrying amounts ranging from approximately 9% to approximately 269% as of June 1, 2019 valuation date. The fair value of the Boots reporting unit, in the Retail Pharmacy International division, is in excess of its carrying value by approximately 9% . As at August 31, 2019 , the carrying value of the goodwill of the Boots reporting unit is $2.6 billion . The Company continues to closely monitor industry and market trends and the impact it may have on the Boots reporting unit and indefinite-lived intangibles as the challenging market conditions in the UK continued to impact the operating performance of the Boots reporting unit during the three months ended August 31, 2019 .  Indefinite-lived intangible assets are tested by comparing the estimated fair value of the asset to its carrying value. If the carrying value of the asset exceeds its estimated fair value, an impairment loss is recognized and the asset is written down to its estimated fair value. Indefinite-lived intangible assets fair values are estimated using the relief from royalty method and excess earnings method of the income approach. These estimates can be affected by a number of factors including, but not limited to, general economic conditions, availability of market information as well as our profitability. The fair values of indefinite-lived intangibles within the Boots reporting unit exceeded their carrying value amounts ranging from approximately 3% to approximately 29%, except for the pharmacy licenses. As at August 31, 2019 , the carrying value of these indefinite-lived intangibles within the Boots reporting unit is $6.9 billion . During the fiscal year ended August 31, 2019, the Company recorded an impairment of $73 million on its pharmacy licenses in the Boots reporting unit, which was included in selling, general, and administrative expenses in the Consolidated Statement of Earnings. See note 6 , goodwill and other intangible assets , to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Cost of sales and inventory  Cost of sales includes the purchase price of goods and cost of services rendered, store and warehouse inventory loss, inventory obsolescence and supplier rebates. In addition to product costs, cost of sales includes warehousing costs for retail operations, purchasing costs, freight costs, cash discounts and vendor allowances. Cost of sales for our Retail Pharmacy USA segment is derived based upon point-of-sale scanning information with an estimate for shrinkage and is adjusted based on periodic inventory counts. Inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market determined by the last-in, first-out (LIFO) method for the Retail Pharmacy USA segment and primarily on a first-in first-out (FIFO) basis for inventory in the Retail Pharmacy International and Pharmaceutical Wholesale segments.  Equity method investments   The Company uses the equity method of accounting for equity investments in companies if the investment provides the ability to exercise significant influence, but not control, over operating and financial policies of the investee. The Companys proportionate share of the net income or loss of these companies is included in consolidated net earnings. Judgment regarding the level of influence over each equity method investment includes considering key factors such as the Companys ownership interest, legal form of the investee (e.g. limited liability partnership), representation on the board of directors, participation in policy-making decisions and material intra-entity transactions The Company evaluates equity method investments for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the investment might not be recoverable. Factors considered by the Company when reviewing an equity method investment for impairment include the length of time (duration) and the extent (severity) to which the fair value of the equity method investment has been less than cost, the investees financial condition and near-term prospects and the intent and ability to hold the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for anticipated recovery. An impairment that is other-than-temporary is recognized in the period identified.  Pension and postretirement benefits  The Company has various defined benefit pension plans that cover some of its non-U.S. employees. The Company also has a postretirement healthcare plan that covers qualifying U.S. employees. Eligibility and the level of benefits for these plans vary depending on participants status, date of hire and or length of service. Pension and postretirement plan expenses and valuations are dependent on assumptions used by third-party actuaries in calculating those amounts. These assumptions include discount rates, healthcare cost trends, long-term return on plan assets, retirement rates, mortality rates and other factors.  In determining long-term rate of return on plan assets assumption, the Company considers both the historical performance of the investment portfolio as well as the long-term market return expectations based on the investment mix of the portfolio. A change in any of these assumptions would have an effect on its pension expense. A 25 basis point increase in the discount rate would result in a decline of $368.1 million to the Companys pension benefit obligation. A 25 basis point decrease on the expected return on plan assets assumption would increase the Companys pension expense by $19.1 million. - 53 - The Company funds its pension plans in accordance with applicable regulations. The postretirement healthcare plan is not funded.  Income taxes  The Company is subject to routine income tax audits that occur periodically in the normal course of business. U.S. federal, state, local and foreign tax authorities raise questions regarding the Companys tax filing positions, including the timing and amount of deductions and the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions. In evaluating the tax benefits associated with the various tax filing positions, the Company records a tax benefit for uncertain tax positions using the highest cumulative tax benefit that is more likely than not to be realized. Adjustments are made to the liability for unrecognized tax benefits in the period in which the Company determines the issue is effectively settled with the tax authorities, the statute of limitations expires for the return containing the tax position or when more information becomes available. The liability for unrecognized tax benefits, including accrued penalties and interest, is primarily included in other non-current liabilities and current income taxes on the Companys Consolidated Balance Sheets and in income tax provision in its Consolidated Statements of Earnings.  In determining its provision for income taxes, the Company uses income, permanent differences between book and tax income and enacted statutory income tax rates. The provision for income taxes rate also reflects its assessment of the ultimate outcome of tax audits in addition to any foreign-based income deemed to be taxable in the United States. Discrete events such as audit settlements or changes in tax laws are recognized in the period in which they occur. - 54 - CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS AND COMMITMENTS The following table lists the Companys contractual obligations and commitments at August 31, 2019 (in millions): ##TABLE_START   Payments due by period   Total  Less than 1 year  1-3 years  3-5 years  Over 5 years Operating leases 1  $ 32,268  $ 3,484  $ 6,447  $ 5,714  $ 16,623 Purchase obligations:  3,231  2,359    Open inventory purchase orders  1,708  1,707      Real estate development         Other obligations  1,344     Short-term debt and long-term debt*  16,916  5,752  1,741  1,200  8,223 Interest payment on short-term debt and long-term debt  4,704     2,878 Retirement benefit obligations      Closed location obligations 1  1,613     Capital lease obligations* 1  1,093     Finance lease obligations      Other liabilities reflected on the balance sheet* 2  1,216     Total  $ 62,047 $ 12,480  $ 10,302  $ 8,358  $ 30,908 ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START * Recorded on balance sheet. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START 1  Amounts do not include certain operating expenses under these leases such as common area maintenance, insurance and real estate taxes, where appropriate.

Quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk Interest rate risk The Company is exposed to interest rate volatility with regard to existing variable-rate debt instruments and future incurrences of fixed or variable-rate debt, which exposure primarily relates to movements in various interest rates, such as U.S treasury rates and commercial paper rates. From time to time, the Company uses interest rate swaps and forward-starting interest rate swaps to hedge its exposure to the impact of interest rate changes on existing debt and future debt issuances respectively, to reduce the volatility of financing costs and, based on current and projected market conditions, achieve a desired proportion of fixed-rate versus floating-rate debt. Generally under these swaps, the Company agrees with a counterparty to exchange the difference between fixed-rate and floating-rate interest amounts based on an agreed upon notional principal amount. Information regarding the Companys transactions are set forth in note 8 , financial instruments , to the Consolidated Financial Statements. These financial instruments are sensitive to changes in interest rates. On August 31, 2019 , the Company had no material long-term debt obligations that had floating interest rates. The amounts exclude the impact of any associated derivative contracts. Foreign currency exchange rate risk The Company is exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, primarily with respect to the British pound sterling and Euro,  and certain other foreign currencies, which may affect its net investment in foreign subsidiaries and may cause fluctuations in cash flows related to foreign denominated transactions. The Company is also exposed to the translation of foreign currency earnings to the U.S. dollar. The Company enters into foreign currency forward contracts to hedge against the effect of exchange rate fluctuations on non-functional currency cash flows. These transactions are almost exclusively less than 12 months in maturity. In addition, the Company enters into foreign currency forward contracts that are not designated in hedging relationships to offset, in part, the impacts of certain intercompany activities (primarily associated with intercompany financing transactions). Under certain market conditions, the Company may seek to protect against possible declines in the reported net investments of our foreign subsidiaries by using foreign currency cross-currency swaps, foreign currency forward-exchange contracts or foreign currency debt. The Companys foreign currency derivative instruments are sensitive to changes in exchange rates. A hypothetical 1% change in foreign currency exchange rates versus the U.S. dollar would change the fair value of the foreign currency derivatives held as of August 31, 2019 , by approximately $22 million. The foreign currency derivatives are intended to partially hedge anticipated transactions, foreign currency trade payables and receivables and net investments in foreign subsidiaries. Equity price risk Changes in AmerisourceBergen common stock price may have a significant impact on the fair value of the equity investment in AmerisourceBergen described in note 5 , equity method investments , to the Consolidated Financial Statements. See --Investment in AmerisourceBergen above. - 57 - ", "8": " Item 8. Financial statements and supplementary data WALGREENS BOOTS ALLIANCE, INC.

AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Note 1 . Summary of major accounting policies Organization Walgreens Boots Alliance and its subsidiaries are a global leader in retail and wholesale pharmacy . Its operations are conducted through three reportable segments: Retail Pharmacy USA, Retail Pharmacy International and Pharmaceutical Wholesale. See note 16 , segment reporting and note 17 , sales , for further information. Basis of presentation The Consolidated Financial Statements include all subsidiaries in which the Company holds a controlling interest. The Company uses the equity-method of accounting for equity investments in less than majority-owned companies if the investment provides the ability to exercise significant influence. All intercompany transactions have been eliminated. The preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP) requires management to use judgment in the application of accounting policies, including making estimates and assumptions. The Company bases its estimates on the information available at the time, its experience and various other assumptions believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Adjustments may be made in subsequent periods to reflect more current estimates and assumptions about matters that are inherently uncertain. Actual results may differ. The influence of certain holidays, seasonality, foreign currency rates, changes in vendor, payer and customer relationships and terms, strategic transactions including acquisitions, changes in laws and general economic conditions in the markets in which the Company operates and other factors on the Companys operations and net earnings for any period may not be comparable to the same period in previous years. Certain amounts in the Consolidated Financial Statements and associated notes may not add due to rounding. All percentages have been calculated using unrounded amounts for fiscal 2019.  Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents include cash on hand and highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less. Credit and debit card receivables, which generally settle within two to seven business days, of $90 million and $127 million were included in cash and cash equivalents at August 31, 2019 and 2018 , respectively. Restricted cash The Company is required to maintain cash deposits with certain banks which consist of deposits restricted under contractual agency agreements and cash restricted by law and other obligations. At August 31, 2019 and 2018 , the amount of such restricted cash was $184 million and $190 million , respectively, and is reported in other current assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Accounts receivable Accounts receivable are stated net of allowances for doubtful accounts. Accounts receivable balances primarily consist of trade receivables due from customers, including amounts due from third-party payers (e.g., pharmacy benefit managers, insurance companies and governmental agencies), clients and members. Trade receivables were $6.0 billion and $5.4 billion at August 31, 2019 and August 31, 2018 , respectively. Other accounts receivable balances, which consist primarily of receivables from vendors and manufacturers, including receivables from AmerisourceBergen (see note 18 , related parties ), were $1.2 billion at August 31, 2019 and 2018 . Charges to allowance for doubtful accounts are based on estimates of recoverability using both historical write-offs and specifically identified receivables. The allowance for doubtful accounts for trade receivables at August 31, 2019 and August 31, 2018 was $95 million and $75 million , respectively. Inventories The Company values inventories on a lower of cost and net realizable value or market basis. Inventories include product costs, inbound freight, direct labor, warehousing costs for retail pharmacy operations, overhead costs relating to the manufacture and distribution of products and vendor allowances not classified as a reduction of advertising expense. The Companys Retail Pharmacy USA segment inventory is accounted for using the last-in-first-out (LIFO) method. The total carrying value of the segment inventory accounted for under the LIFO method was $6.6 billion and $6.7 billion at - 63 - August 31, 2019 and 2018 , respectively. At August 31, 2019 and 2018 , Retail Pharmacy USA segment inventory would have been greater by $3.2 billion and $3.0 billion , respectively, if they had been valued on a lower of first-in-first-out (FIFO) cost and net realizable value. The Companys Retail Pharmacy International and Pharmaceutical Wholesale segments inventory is primarily accounted for using the FIFO method. The total carrying value of the inventory for Retail Pharmacy International and Pharmaceutical Wholesale segments was $2.7 billion and $2.8 billion at August 31, 2019 and 2018 , respectively. Property, plant and equipment Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation. Major repairs, which extend the useful life of an asset, are capitalized; routine maintenance and repairs are charged against earnings. Depreciation is provided on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of owned assets. Leasehold improvements, equipment under capital lease and capital lease properties are amortized over their respective estimate of useful life or over the term of the lease, whichever is shorter. The majority of the Companys fixtures and equipment uses the composite method of depreciation. Therefore, gains and losses on retirement or other disposition of such assets are included in earnings only when an operating location is closed, substantially remodeled or impaired. The following table summarizes the Companys property, plant and equipment (in millions) and estimated useful lives (in years): ##TABLE_START   Estimated useful life   Land and land improvements   $ 3,507  $ 3,593 Buildings and building improvements  3 to 50  8,023  7,874 Fixtures and equipment  3 to 20  9,786  9,750 Capitalized system development costs and software  3 to 8  2,770  2,464 Capital lease properties         24,789  24,424 Less: accumulated depreciation and amortization    11,310  10,513 Balance at end of year    $ 13,478  $ 13,911 ##TABLE_ENDThe Company capitalizes application development stage costs for internally developed software. These costs are amortized over a three to eight year period. Amortization expense for capitalized system development costs and software was $273 million in fiscal 2019 , $254 million in fiscal 2018 and $245 million in fiscal 2017 . Unamortized costs were $1.5 billion at August 31, 2019 and 2018 . Depreciation and amortization expense for property, plant and equipment including capitalized system development costs and software was $1.5 billion in fiscal 2019 , $1.4 billion in fiscal 2018 and $1.3 billion in fiscal 2017 . Leases Initial terms for leased premises in the U.S. are typically 15 to 25 years, followed by additional terms containing renewal options at five -year intervals, and may include rent escalation clauses. Non-U.S. leases are typically for shorter terms and may include cancellation clauses or renewal options. The commencement date of all lease terms is the earlier of the date the Company becomes legally obligated to make rent payments or the date the Company has the right to control the property. In addition to minimum fixed rentals, some leases provide for contingent rentals based upon a portion of sales. Capital leases are recognized within property, plant and equipment and as a capital lease liability within accrued expenses and other liabilities and other non-current liabilities. Operating leases are expensed on a straight line basis over the lease term. See note 4 , leases , for further information. Business combinations The Company allocates the fair value of purchase consideration to the tangible and intangible assets purchased and the liabilities assumed on the basis of their fair values at the date of acquisition. The determination of fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed requires estimates and the use of valuation techniques when a market value is not readily available. Any excess of purchase price over the fair value of net tangible and intangible assets acquired is allocated to goodwill. If the Company obtains new information about facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date during the measurement period, which may be up to one year from the acquisition date, the Company may record adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed. - 64 - Goodwill and other intangible assets Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in business combinations. Acquired intangible assets are recorded at fair value. Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are evaluated for impairment annually during the fourth quarter, or more frequently if an event occurs or circumstances change that could more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit or intangible asset below its carrying value. As part of the Companys impairment analysis, fair value of a reporting unit is determined using both the income and market approaches. The income approach requires management to estimate a number of factors for each reporting unit, including projected future operating results, economic projections, anticipated future cash flows and discount rates. The market approach estimates fair value using comparable marketplace fair value data from within a comparable industry grouping.  Finite-lived intangible assets are amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives. See note 6 , goodwill and other intangible assets , for additional disclosure regarding the Companys intangible assets. Equity method investments The Company uses the equity method of accounting for equity investments in companies if the investment provides the ability to exercise significant influence, but not control, over operating and financial policies of the investee. The Companys proportionate share of the net income or loss of these companies is included in consolidated net earnings. Judgment regarding the level of influence over each equity method investment includes considering key factors such as the Companys ownership interest, legal form of the investee (e.g. limited liability partnership), representation on the board of directors, participation in policy-making decisions and material intra-entity transactions . The Company evaluates equity method investments for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the investment might not be recoverable. Factors considered by the Company when reviewing an equity method investment for impairment include the length of time (duration) and the extent (severity) to which the fair value of the equity method investment has been less than cost, the investees financial condition and near-term prospects and the intent and ability to hold the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for anticipated recovery. An impairment that is other-than-temporary is recognized in the period identified.  See note 5 , equity method investments , for further information. Financial instruments The Company uses derivative instruments to hedge its exposure to interest rate and currency risks arising from operating and financing activities. In accordance with its risk management policies, the Company does not hold or issue derivative instruments for trading or speculative purposes. Derivatives are recognized on the Consolidated Balance Sheets at their fair values. When the Company becomes a party to a derivative instrument and intends to apply hedge accounting, it formally documents the hedge relationship and the risk management objective for undertaking the hedge which includes designating the instrument for financial reporting purposes as a fair value hedge, a cash flow hedge, or a net investment hedge. The accounting for changes in fair value of a derivative instrument depends on whether the Company had designated it in a qualifying hedging relationship and on the type of hedging relationship. The Company applies the following accounting policies: ##TABLE_START  Changes in the fair value of a derivative designated as a fair value hedge, along with the gain or loss on the hedged asset or liability attributable to the hedged risk, are recorded in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings in the same line item, generally interest expense, net. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Changes in the fair value of a derivative designated as a cash flow hedge are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income and reclassified into earnings in the period or periods during which the hedged item affects earnings and is presented in the same line item as the earnings effect of the hedged item. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Changes in the fair value of a derivative designated as a hedge of a net investment in a foreign operation are recorded in cumulative translation adjustments within accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income. Recognition in earnings of amounts previously recorded in cumulative translation adjustments is limited to circumstances such as complete or substantially complete liquidation of the net investment in the hedged investments in foreign operations. ##TABLE_END- 65 - ##TABLE_START  Changes in the fair value of a derivative not designated in a hedging relationship are recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings. ##TABLE_END Cash receipts or payments on a settlement of a derivative contract are reported in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows consistent with the nature of the underlying hedged item. For derivative instruments designated as hedges, the Company assesses, both at the hedges inception and on an ongoing basis, whether the derivatives that are used in hedging transactions are highly effective in offsetting changes in fair values or cash flows of hedged items. Highly effective means that cumulative changes in the fair value of the derivative are between 80% and 125% of the cumulative changes in the fair value of the hedged item. In addition, when the Company determines that a derivative is not highly effective as a hedge, hedge accounting is discontinued. When it is probable that a hedged forecasted transaction will not occur, the Company discontinues hedge accounting for the affected portion of the forecasted transaction and reclassifies any gains or losses in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) to earnings in the Consolidated Statement of Earnings. When a derivative in a hedge relationship is terminated or the hedged item is sold, extinguished or terminated, hedge accounting is discontinued prospectively.  Liabilities for facility closings The Company provides for future costs related to closed locations. The liability is based on the present value of future rent obligations and other related costs (net of estimated sublease rent) to the first lease option date. The liability for facility closings, including locations closed under the Companys restructuring actions, was $993 million as of August 31, 2019 and $964 million as of August 31, 2018 . See note 4 , leases , for further information.  Pension and postretirement benefits The Company has various defined benefit pension plans that cover some of its non-U.S. employees. The Company also has a postretirement healthcare plan that covers qualifying U.S. employees. Eligibility and the level of benefits for these plans vary depending on participants status, date of hire and or length of service. Pension and postretirement plan expenses and valuations are dependent on assumptions used by third-party actuaries in calculating those amounts. These assumptions include discount rates, healthcare cost trends, long-term return on plan assets, retirement rates, mortality rates and other factors.  The Company funds its pension plans in accordance with applicable regulations. The Company records the service cost component of net pension cost and net postretirement benefit cost in selling, general and administrative expenses. The Company records all other net cost components of net pension cost and net postretirement benefit cost in other income (expense). The postretirement healthcare plan is not funded.  See note 13 , retirement benefits , for further information. Noncontrolling interests The Company presents noncontrolling interests as a component of equity on its Consolidated Balance Sheets and reports the portion of its earnings or loss for noncontrolling interest as net earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings. Currency Assets and liabilities of non-U.S. dollar functional currency operations are translated into U.S. dollars at end-of-period exchange rates while revenues, expenses and cash flows are translated at average monthly exchange rates over the period. Equity is translated at historical exchange rates and the resulting cumulative translation adjustments are included as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Assets and liabilities not denominated in the functional currency are remeasured into the functional currency at end-of-period exchange rates, except for nonmonetary balance sheet amounts, which are remeasured at historical exchange rates. Revenues and expenses are recorded at average monthly exchange rates over the period, except for those expenses related to nonmonetary balance sheet amounts, which are remeasured at historical exchange rates. Gains or losses from foreign currency remeasurement are generally included in selling, general and administrative expenses within the Consolidated Statements of Earnings. For all periods presented, there were no material operational gains or losses from foreign currency transactions. Commitments and contingencies On a quarterly basis, the Company assesses its liabilities and contingencies for outstanding legal proceedings and reserves are established on a case-by-case basis for those legal claims for which management concludes that it is probable that a loss will be incurred and that the amount of such loss can be reasonably estimated. Substantially all of these contingencies are subject to significant uncertainties and, therefore, determining the likelihood of a loss and/or the measurement of any loss can be - 66 - complex. With respect to litigation and other legal proceedings where the Company has determined that a loss is reasonably possible, the Company may be unable to estimate the amount or range of reasonably possible loss due to the inherent difficulty of predicting the outcome of and uncertainties regarding such litigation and legal proceedings. The Companys assessments are based on estimates and assumptions that have been deemed reasonable by management, but that may prove to be incomplete or inaccurate, and unanticipated events and circumstances may occur that might cause the Company to change those estimates and assumptions. Therefore, it is possible that an unfavorable resolution of one or more pending litigation or other contingencies could have a material adverse effect on the Companys Consolidated Financial Statements in a future fiscal period. Managements assessment of current litigation and other legal proceedings, including the corresponding accruals, could change because of the discovery of facts with respect to legal actions or other proceedings pending against the Company which are not presently known. Adverse rulings or determinations by judges, juries, governmental authorities or other parties could also result in changes to managements assessment of current liabilities and contingencies. Accordingly, the ultimate costs of resolving these claims may be substantially higher or lower than the amounts reserved. See note 10 , commitments and contingencies , for further information. Revenue recognition Sales are recognized at an amount that reflects the consideration to which the Company expects to be entitled in exchange for transferring control of goods or services to the customer. Sales are reported on the gross amount billed to a customer less discounts if it has earned revenue as a principal from the sale of goods and services. Sales are reported on the net amount retained (that is, the amount billed to the customer less the amount paid to a vendor) if it has earned a commission or a fee as an agent. Retail Pharmacy USA and Retail Pharmacy International The Company recognizes revenue, net of taxes and expected returns, at the time it sells merchandise or dispenses prescription drugs to the customer. The Company estimates revenue based on expected reimbursements from third-party payers (e.g., pharmacy benefit managers, insurance companies and governmental agencies) for dispensing prescription drugs. The estimates are based on all available information including historical experience and are updated to actual reimbursement amounts. Pharmaceutical Wholesale Wholesale revenue is recognized, net of taxes and expected returns, upon shipment of goods, which is generally also the day of delivery. Loyalty programs and gift cards The Companys loyalty rewards programs represent a separate performance obligation and are accounted for using the deferred revenue approach. When goods are sold, the transaction price is allocated between goods sold and loyalty points awarded based upon the relative standalone selling price. The revenue allocated to the loyalty points is recognized upon redemption. Loyalty programs breakage is recognized as revenue based on the redemption pattern. Customer purchases of gift cards are not recognized as revenue until the card is redeemed. Gift card breakage (i.e., unused gift card) is recognized as revenue based on the redemption pattern. Cost of sales Cost of sales includes the purchase price of goods and cost of services rendered, store and warehouse inventory loss, inventory obsolescence and supplier rebates. In addition to product costs, cost of sales includes warehousing costs for retail operations, purchasing costs, freight costs, cash discounts and vendor allowances.  Vendor allowances and supplier rebates Vendor allowances are principally received as a result of purchases, sales or promotion of vendors products. Allowances are generally recorded as a reduction of inventory and are recognized as a reduction of cost of sales when the related merchandise is sold. Allowances received for promoting vendors products are offset against advertising expense and result in a reduction of selling, general and administrative expenses to the extent of advertising costs incurred, with the excess treated as a reduction of inventory costs. Rebates or refunds received by the Company from its suppliers, mostly in cash, are considered as an adjustment of the prices of the suppliers products purchased by the Company. Selling, general and administrative expenses Selling, general and administrative expenses mainly consist of salaries and employee costs, occupancy costs, depreciation and amortization, credit and debit card fees and expenses directly related to stores. In addition, other costs included are headquarters expenses, advertising costs (net of vendor advertising allowances), wholesale warehousing costs and insurance. - 67 - Advertising costs Advertising costs, which are reduced by the portion funded by vendors, are expensed as incurred or when services have been received. Net advertising expenses, which are included in selling, general and administrative expenses, were $585 million in fiscal 2019 , $665 million in fiscal 2018 and $571 million in fiscal 2017 . Impairment of long-lived assets The Company tests long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that a certain asset or asset group may be impaired. Once identified, the amount of the impairment is computed by comparing the carrying value of the assets to the fair value, which is primarily based on the discounted estimated future cash flows. Impairment charges included in selling, general and administrative expenses were $260 million in fiscal 2019 . Impairment charges recognized in fiscal 2018 and 2017 were $57 million and $234 million , respectively. Stock compensation plans Stock based compensation is measured at fair value at the grant date. The Company grants stock options, performance shares and restricted units to the Companys non-employee directors, officers and employees. The Company recognizes compensation expense on a straight-line basis over the substantive service period. See note 12 , stock compensation plans , for more information on the Companys stock-based compensation plans. Insurance The Company obtains insurance coverage for catastrophic exposures as well as those risks required by law to be insured. In general, the Companys U.S. subsidiaries retain a significant portion of losses related to workers compensation, property, comprehensive general, pharmacist and vehicle liability, while non-U.S. subsidiaries manage their exposures through insurance coverage with third-party carriers. Management regularly reviews the probable outcome of claims and proceedings, the expenses expected to be incurred, the availability and limits of the insurance coverage and the established accruals for liabilities. Liabilities for losses are recorded based upon the Companys estimates for both claims incurred and claims incurred but not reported. The provisions are estimated in part by considering historical claims experience, demographic factors and other actuarial assumptions. Income taxes The Company accounts for income taxes according to the asset and liability method. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized based upon the estimated future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured pursuant to tax laws using rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rate is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. Valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amounts more likely than not to be realized. In determining the provision for income taxes, the Company uses income, permanent differences between book and tax income, the relative proportion of foreign and domestic income, enacted statutory income tax rates, projections of income subject to Subpart F rules and unrecognized tax benefits related to current year results. Discrete events such as the assessment of the ultimate outcome of tax audits, audit settlements, recognizing previously unrecognized tax benefits due to lapsing of the applicable statute of limitations, recognizing or de-recognizing benefits of deferred tax assets due to future year financial statement projections and changes in tax laws are recognized in the period in which they occur. The Company is subject to routine income tax audits that occur periodically in the normal course of business. U.S. federal, state, local and foreign tax authorities raise questions regarding the Companys tax filing positions, including the timing and amount of deductions and the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions. In evaluating the tax benefits associated with the various tax filing positions, the Company records a tax benefit for uncertain tax positions using the highest cumulative tax benefit that is more likely than not to be realized. Adjustments are made to the liability for unrecognized tax benefits in the period in which the Company determines the issue is effectively settled with the tax authorities, the statute of limitations expires for the return containing the tax position or when more information becomes available.  Earnings per share The dilutive effect of outstanding stock options on earnings per share is calculated using the treasury stock method. Stock options are anti-dilutive and excluded from the earnings per share calculation if the exercise price exceeds the average market price of the common shares. Outstanding options to purchase common shares that were anti-dilutive and excluded from earnings per share totaled 14.9 million , 10.1 million and 3.9 million in fiscal 2019 , 2018 and 2017 , respectively. - 68 - New accounting pronouncements Adoption of new accounting pronouncements Presentation of net periodic pension cost and net periodic postretirement benefit cost In March 2017, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (\"ASU\") 2017-07, Compensation - Retirement Benefits (Topic 715): Improving the Presentation of Net Periodic Pension Cost and Net Periodic Postretirement Benefit Cost. This ASU requires an employer to report the service cost component of net periodic pension cost and net periodic postretirement benefit cost in the same line item in the statement of earnings as other compensation costs arising from services rendered by the related employees during the period. All other net cost components are required to be presented in the statement of earnings separately from the service cost component and outside a subtotal of income from operations. Additionally, the line item used in the statement of earnings to present the other net cost components must be disclosed in the notes to the financial statements. The Company adopted this new accounting guidance as of September 1, 2018 (fiscal 2019) on a retrospective basis and the adoption did not have a material impact on the Company's results of operations, cash flows or financial position. The impact on our previously reported net periodic costs as a result of the retrospective adoption of this standard results in a reclassification from selling, general and administrative expenses to other income (expense) of $125 million and $73 million for the fiscal years ended August 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The following is a reconciliation of the effect of the reclassification of all other net cost components (excluding service cost component) of net pension cost and net postretirement benefit cost from selling, general and administrative expenses to other income (expense) in the Companys Consolidated Statements of Earnings (in millions): ##TABLE_START  As reported  Adjustments  As revised Twelve months ended August 31, 2018      Selling, general and administrative expenses $ 24,569  $  $ 24,694 Operating income 6,414  (125 )  6,289 Other income (expense)   Twelve months ended August 31, 2017      Selling, general and administrative expenses $ 23,740  $  $ 23,813 Operating income 5,557  (73 )  5,484 Other income (expense) (11 )   ##TABLE_ENDRestricted cash In November 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-18, Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Restricted Cash. This ASU requires that a statement of cash flows explain the change during the period in the total of cash, cash equivalents, and amounts generally described as restricted cash or restricted cash equivalents. Therefore, amounts generally described as restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents should be included with cash and cash equivalents when reconciling the beginning-of-period and end-of-period total amounts shown on the Statement of Cash Flows. The Company adopted this new accounting guidance as of September 1, 2018 (fiscal 2019) on a full retrospective basis and the adoption did not have a material impact on the Companys Statement of Cash Flows. The following is a reconciliation of the effect on the relevant line items on the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows for the twelve months ended August 31, 2018 and 2017 as a result of adopting this new accounting guidance (in millions): - 69 - ##TABLE_START  As reported  Adjustments  As revised Twelve months ended August 31, 2018      Trade accounts payable $ 1,323  $  $ 1,352 Accrued expenses and other liabilities   Other non-current assets and liabilities (275 )  (36 )  (311 ) Net cash provided by operating activities 8,265  (2 )  8,263       Effect of exchange rate changes on cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash  (4 )  Net increase (decrease) in cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash (2,516 )  (6 )  (2,522 ) Cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash at beginning of period 3,301   3,496 Cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash at end of period $  $  $ ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  As reported  Adjustments  As revised Twelve months ended August 31, 2017      Trade accounts payable $ 1,690  $ (6 )  $ 1,684 Accrued expenses and other liabilities (128 )    (128 ) Other non-current assets and liabilities   Net cash provided by operating activities 7,251   7,255       Effect of exchange rate changes on cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash   Net increase (decrease) in cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash (6,506 )   (6,496 ) Cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash at beginning of period 9,807   9,992 Cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash at end of period $ 3,301  $  $ 3,496 ##TABLE_ENDTax accounting for intra-entity asset transfers In October 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-16, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Intra-Entity Transfers of Assets Other Than Inventory. This ASU prohibits the recognition of current and deferred income taxes for an intra-entity asset transfer until the asset has been sold to an outside party. In addition, interpretations of this guidance have developed in practice for transfers of certain intangible and tangible assets. This prohibition on recognition is an exception to the principle of comprehensive recognition of current and deferred income taxes. To more faithfully represent the economics of intra-entity asset transfers, the amendments in this ASU require that entities recognize the income tax consequences of an intra-entity transfer of an asset other than inventory when the transfer occurs. This ASU does not change the pre-tax effects of an intra-entity asset transfer under Topic 810, Consolidation, or for an intra-entity transfer of inventory. The Company adopted this new accounting guidance as of September 1, 2018 (fiscal 2019) on a modified retrospective basis and the adoption did not have a material impact on the Company's results of operations. Classification of certain cash receipts and cash payments In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-15, Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments. This ASU addresses the classification of certain specific cash flow issues including debt prepayments or extinguishment costs, settlement of certain debt instruments, contingent consideration payments made after a business combination, proceeds from the settlement of certain insurance claims, and distributions received from equity method investees. The Company adopted this new accounting guidance as of September 1, 2018 (fiscal 2019) and adoption did not have a material impact on the Companys Statement of Cash Flows. Revenue recognition on contracts with customers In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606). Subsequently, the FASB issued additional ASUs, which further clarify this guidance. This ASU provides a single principles-based revenue recognition model with a five-step analysis of transactions to determine when and how revenue is recognized. The core principle is that a company should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects - 70 - the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. The Company adopted this new accounting guidance on September 1, 2018 (fiscal 2019) using the modified retrospective transition approach for all contracts and the adoption did not have a material impact on the Companys results of operations. The adoption mainly resulted in changes to recognition of revenues related to loyalty programs and gift cards breakage. Prior to adoption, the Company used the cost approach to account for loyalty programs. Upon adoption, the Company uses the deferred revenue approach. Prior to adoption, gift card breakage was primarily recognized at point of sale. Upon adoption, all gift card breakage is recognized based on the redemption pattern. The changes in accounting for loyalty programs and gift card breakage resulted in a cumulative transition adjustment of $98 million in retained earnings. See note 17 , sales , for additional disclosures. See the updated accounting policy for revenue recognition and loyalty programs in the revenue recognition section above. Classification and measurement of financial instruments In January 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-01, Financial Instruments - Overall (Subtopic 825-10): Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities. Subsequently, the FASB issued additional ASUs, which further clarify this guidance. This ASU requires equity investments (except those under the equity method of accounting or those that result in the consolidation of an investee) to be measured at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in net income. However, an entity may choose to measure equity investments that do not have readily determinable fair values at cost less impairment, if any, and changes resulting from observable price changes in orderly transactions for the identical or a similar investment of the same issuer. This simplifies the impairment assessment of equity investments previously held at cost. Separate presentation of financial assets and liabilities by measurement category is required. The Company adopted this new accounting guidance as of September 1, 2018 (fiscal 2019) and adoption did not have a material impact on the Companys results of operations, cash flows or financial position. The new guidance was applied on a modified retrospective basis, with the exception of the amendments related to the measurement alternative for equity investments without readily determinable fair values, which was applied on a prospective basis. New accounting pronouncements not yet adopted Investments - equity securities In April 2019, the FASB issued ASU 2019-04, Codification Improvements to Financial Instruments-Credit Losses (Topic 326), Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815), and Financial Instruments (Topic 825). This extensive ASU provides clarifications for three topics related to financial instruments accounting, some of which apply to the Company. For example, this ASU clarifies the disclosure requirements that apply to equity securities without a readily determinable fair value for which the measurement alternative is elected. This ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019 (fiscal 2021). The adoption of this ASU is not expected to have a significant impact on the Company's results of operations, cash flows or financial position. Collaborative arrangements In November 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-18, Collaborative Arrangements (Topic 808). This ASU clarifies the interaction between Topic 808, Collaborative Arrangements, and Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers. This ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019 (fiscal 2021). The adoption of this ASU is not expected to have a significant impact on the Companys results of operations, cash flows or financial position. Financial instruments - hedging and derivatives In October 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-16, Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815): Inclusion of the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR) Overnight Index Swap (OIS) Rate as Benchmark Interest Rate for Hedge Accounting Purposes. This ASU permits use of the OIS rate based on the SOFR as a U.S. benchmark interest rate for hedge accounting purposes. This ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018 (fiscal 2020), and interim periods within those fiscal years, with early adoption permitted. The new guidance must be applied on a prospective basis. The adoption of this ASU is not expected to have a significant impact on the Companys results of operations, cash flows or financial position. Intangibles  goodwill and other  internal-use software In August 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-15, Intangibles-Goodwill and Other- Internal-Use Software (Subtopic 350-40). This ASU addresses customers accounting for implementation costs incurred in a cloud computing arrangement that is a service contract and also adds certain disclosure requirements related to implementation costs incurred for internal-use software and cloud computing arrangements. The amendment aligns the requirements for capitalizing implementation costs incurred in a hosting arrangement that is a service contract with the requirements for capitalizing implementation costs incurred to develop or obtain internal-use software (and hosting arrangements that include an internal-use software license). This ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019 (fiscal 2021), and interim periods within those fiscal years, with early adoption permitted. The amendments in this ASU can be applied either retrospectively or prospectively to all implementation costs incurred after the date of adoption. The Company is evaluating the effect of adopting this new accounting guidance, but does not expect adoption will have a material impact on the Companys financial position or results of operations. - 71 - Compensation  retirement benefits  defined benefit plans In August 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-14, Compensation - Retirement benefits (Topic 715-20). This ASU amends ASC 715 to add, remove and clarify disclosure requirements related to defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans. The ASU eliminates the requirement to disclose the amounts in accumulated other comprehensive income expected to be recognized as part of net periodic benefit cost over the next year. The ASU also removes the disclosure requirements for the effects of a one-percentage-point change on the assumed health care costs and the effect of this change in rates on service cost, interest cost and the benefit obligation for postretirement health care benefits. This ASU is effective for fiscal years ending after December 15, 2020 (fiscal 2022) and must be applied on a retrospective basis. The Company is evaluating the effect of adopting this new accounting guidance, but does not expect adoption will have a material impact on the Company's financial position. Fair value measurement In August 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-13, Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820). The ASU eliminates such disclosures as the amount of and reasons for transfers between Level 1 and Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. The ASU adds new disclosure requirements for Level 3 measurements. This ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019 (fiscal 2021), and interim periods within those fiscal years, with early adoption permitted for any eliminated or modified disclosures. The Company is evaluating the effect of adopting this new accounting guidance, but does not expect adoption will have a material impact on the Company's disclosures. Contributions made In June 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-08, Clarifying the Scope and the Accounting Guidance for Contributions Received and Contributions Made (Topic 958). This ASU clarifies and improves guidance about whether a transfer of assets (or reduction of liabilities) is a contribution or an exchange transaction, and whether a contribution is conditional. The ASU applies to all entities, including business entities, that receive or make contributions of cash or other assets, including promises to give. This ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018 (fiscal 2020) and must be applied on a prospective basis in the period of adoption. The Company is evaluating the effect of adopting this new accounting guidance, but does not expect adoption will have a material impact on the Companys financial position or results of operations. Compensation  stock compensation In June 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-07, Compensation-Stock Compensation (Topic 718). This ASU eliminated most of the differences between accounting guidance for share-based compensation granted to nonemployees and the guidance for share-based compensation granted to employees. The ASU supersedes the guidance for nonemployees and expands the scope of the guidance for employees to include both. This ASU is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2018 (fiscal 2020), and interim periods within those years. The Company is evaluating the effect of adopting this new accounting guidance, but does not expect adoption will have a material impact on the Company's financial position. Accounting for reclassification of certain tax effects from accumulated other comprehensive income In February 2018, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2018-02, Income Statement-Reporting Comprehensive Income (Topic 220): Reclassification of Certain Tax Effects from Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income. This ASU addresses the income tax effects of items in accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI) which were originally recognized in other comprehensive income, rather than in income from continuing operations. Specifically, it permits a reclassification from AOCI to retained earnings for the adjustment of deferred taxes due to the reduction of the historical corporate income tax rate to the newly enacted corporate income tax rate resulting from the U.S. tax law changes enacted in December 2017. It also requires certain disclosures about these reclassifications. This ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018 (fiscal 2020), and interim periods within those fiscal years, with early adoption permitted. The new guidance must be applied either on a prospective basis in the period of adoption or retrospectively to each period (or periods) in which the effect of the change in the U.S. federal corporate income tax rate in the U.S. tax law changes are recognized. The Company does not expect this adoption will have a material impact on the Companys financial position. Financial instruments - credit losses In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13: Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments (Topic 326), which amends the Boards guidance on the impairment of financial instruments. The ASU adds to U.S. GAAP an impairment model that is based on expected losses rather than incurred losses, which is known as the current expected credit loss (CECL) model. The CECL model applies to most debt instruments (other than those measured at fair value), trade and other receivables, financial guarantee contracts, and loan commitments. This ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019 (fiscal 2021), and interim periods within those fiscal years, with early adoption permitted. The Company is evaluating the effect of adopting this new accounting guidance, but does not expect adoption will have a material impact on the Companys financial position or results of operations. - 72 - Leases In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842), which supersedes Topic 840, Leases. Subsequently, the FASB has issued additional ASUs which further clarify this guidance. This ASU increases the transparency and comparability of organizations by requiring the capitalization of substantially all leases on the balance sheet and disclosures of key information about leasing arrangements. Under this new guidance, at the lease commencement date, a lessee recognizes a right- of-use asset and lease liability, which is initially measured at the present value of the future lease payments. For income statement purposes, a dual model was retained for lessees, requiring leases to be classified as either operating or finance leases. Under the operating lease model, lease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Under the finance lease model, interest on the lease liability is recognized separately from amortization of the right-of-use asset. In addition, a new ASU was issued in July 2018, to provide relief to companies from restating the comparative periods. The Company adopted this new accounting standard on September 1, 2019 on a modified retrospective basis and applied the new standard to all leases through a cumulative-effect adjustment to beginning retained earnings. As a result, comparative financial information has not been restated and continues to be reported under the accounting standards in effect for those periods. The Company elected a package of practical expedients permitted under the transition guidance, which among other things, allows the carryforward of historical lease classification. The adoption of this new accounting standard is expected to result in recognition of lease liabilities of approximately $24 billion and recognition of right-of-use assets of approximately $22 billion net of liabilities for facility closing, deferred rent, favorable lease interest intangible asset, unfavorable lease interest liability, lease incentives and prepaid rent as of August 31, 2019. The adoption is also expected to result in a decrease to retained earnings of approximately $0.4 billion due to transition date impairment of right-of-use assets related to previously impaired long-lived assets of approximately $0.8 billion net of tax, partially offset by de-recognition of deferred gains on historical sale and leaseback transactions of approximately $0.4 billion net of tax. Note 2 . Acquisitions Acquisition of certain Rite Aid assets On September 19, 2017, the Company announced that it had secured regulatory clearance for an amended and restated asset purchase agreement to purchase 1,932 stores, three distribution centers and related inventory from Rite Aid for $4.375 billion in cash and other consideration. The purchases of these stores have been accounted for as business combinations and occurred in waves during fiscal 2018. The Company purchased 1,932 stores for total cash consideration of $4.2 billion for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2018 . As of May 31, 2019 , the Company completed the analysis to assign fair values for assets acquired and liabilities assumed for the acquired stores. During the fiscal year ended August 31, 2019 , the Company recorded certain measurement period adjustments based on additional information primarily to other non-current liabilities, intangible assets and deferred income taxes, which did not have a material impact on goodwill. The following table summarizes the consideration paid and the amounts of identified assets acquired and liabilities assumed for purchase of 1,932 stores as of the fiscal year ended August 31, 2019 . ##TABLE_START Consideration $ 4,330   Identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed  Inventories $ 1,171 Property, plant and equipment Intangible assets 2,039 Accrued expenses and other liabilities (55 ) Deferred income taxes Other non-current liabilities (937 ) Total identifiable net assets $ 2,999 Goodwill $ 1,331 ##TABLE_END- 73 - The identified definite-lived intangible assets were as follows: ##TABLE_START Definite-lived intangible assets Weighted-average useful life (in years) Amount (in millions) Customer relationships $ 1,800 Favorable lease interests 219 Trade names 20 Total  $ 2,039 ##TABLE_ENDConsideration includes cash of $4,157 million and the fair value of the option granted to Rite Aid to become a member of the Companys group purchasing organization, Walgreens Boots Alliance Development GmbH. The fair value for this option was determined using the income approach methodology. The fair value estimates are based on the market compensation for such services and appropriate discount rate, as relevant, that market participants would consider when estimating fair values. During fiscal 2019, this option was terminated resulting in recognition of a gain in other income (expense). The goodwill of $1,331 million arising from the business combinations primarily reflects the expected operational synergies and cost savings generated from the Store Optimization Program as well as the expected growth from new customers. See note 3 , exit and disposal activities , for additional information. The goodwill was allocated to the Retail Pharmacy USA segment. Substantially all of the goodwill recognized is expected to be deductible for income tax purposes. The fair value for customer relationships was determined using the multi-period excess earnings method, a form of the income approach. Real property fair values were determined using primarily the income approach and sales comparison approach. The fair value measurements of the intangible assets are based on significant inputs not observable in the market and thus represent Level 3 measurements. The fair value estimates for the intangible assets are based on projected discounted cash flows, historical and projected financial information and attrition rates, as relevant, that market participants would consider when estimating fair values. The following table presents supplemental unaudited pro forma consolidated sales for the fiscal year ended 2018 and 2017 as if all 1,932 stores were acquired on September 1, 2016. Pro forma net earnings of the Company, assuming these purchases had occurred at the beginning of each period presented, would not be materially different from the results reported. See note 3 , exit and disposal activities , for additional information. The unaudited pro forma information has been prepared for comparative purposes only and is not intended to be indicative of what the Companys results would have been had the purchases occurred at the beginning of the periods presented or results which may occur in the future. ##TABLE_START (in millions) 2018 1  Sales $ 135,503  $ 127,893 ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START 1  Impacted by store closures due to the Store Optimization Program. ##TABLE_END Actual sales from acquired Rite Aid stores for the fiscal year ended 2018 included in the Consolidated Statement of Earnings are as follows: ##TABLE_START (in millions) Sales $ 5,112 ##TABLE_ENDThe 1,932 Rite Aid stores acquired did not have a material impact on net earnings of the Company for the fiscal year ended 2018 . The Company acquired the first distribution center and related inventory for cash consideration of $61 million during the twelve months ended  August 31, 2019 . The transition of the remaining two distribution centers and related inventory remains subject to closing conditions set forth in the amended and restated asset purchase agreement. AllianceRx Walgreens Prime On March 31, 2017, Walgreens Boots Alliance and pharmacy benefit manager Prime Therapeutics LLC (Prime) closed a transaction to form a combined central specialty pharmacy and mail services company AllianceRx Walgreens Prime, as part of a strategic alliance. AllianceRx Walgreens Prime is consolidated by Walgreens Boots Alliance and reported within the Retail Pharmacy USA division in its financial statements. The Company accounted for this acquisition of Primes specialty pharmacy - 74 - and mail services business as a business combination involving noncash purchase consideration of $720 million consisting of the issuance of an equity interest in AllianceRx Walgreens Prime. The Company has completed the purchase accounting for the AllianceRx Walgreens Prime transaction. The following table summarizes the consideration for the acquisition and the amounts of identified assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the date of the transaction (in millions). ##TABLE_START Total consideration $   Identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed  Accounts receivable $ Inventories Property, plant and equipment Intangible assets Trade accounts payable (90 ) Accrued expenses and other liabilities (1 ) Total identifiable net assets Goodwill $ ##TABLE_ENDThe identified intangible assets primarily include payer contracts. These contracts are estimated to have a weighted average useful life of 15 years. The goodwill of $103 million arising from the transaction consists of expected purchasing synergies, operating efficiencies by benchmarking performance and applying best practices across the combined company, consolidation of operations, reductions in selling, general and administrative expenses and combining workforces. Substantially all of the goodwill recognized is not expected to be deductible for income tax purposes. In accordance with ASC Topic 810, Consolidation, the noncontrolling interest was recognized based on its proportionate interest in the identifiable net assets of AllianceRx Walgreens Prime. The difference between the carrying amount of the noncontrolling interest and the fair value recognized as consideration in the business combination is recognized as additional paid in capital. Pro forma net earnings and sales of the Company, assuming the acquisition had occurred at the beginning of each period presented, would not be materially different from the results reported. The acquisition did not have a material impact on net earnings or sales of the Company for fiscal 2017. Other acquisitions  The Company acquired certain prescription files and related pharmacy inventory in Retail Pharmacy USA for the aggregate purchase price of $304 million during the twelve months ended August 31, 2019 . Note 3 . Exit and disposal activities Transformational Cost Management Program On December 20, 2018, the Company announced a transformational cost management program that is expected to deliver in excess of $1.5 billion of annual cost savings by fiscal 2022 (the Transformational Cost Management Program). As of the date of this report, the Company now expects to deliver in excess of $1.8 billion of annual cost savings by fiscal 2022 . The Transformational Cost Management Program, which is multi-faceted and includes divisional optimization initiatives, global smart spending, global smart organization and the transformation of the Companys information technology (IT) capabilities, is designed to help the Company achieve increased cost efficiencies. To date, the Company has taken initial actions across all aspects of the Transformational Cost Management Program. The actions under the Transformational Cost Management Program focus on all reportable segments and the Companys global functions. Divisional optimization within each of the Companys segments includes activities such as optimization of stores which includes plans to close approximately 200 stores in the United Kingdom and approximately 200 locations in the United States. The Company currently estimates that the Transformational Cost Management Program will result in cumulative pre-tax charges to its GAAP financial results of approximately $1.9 billion to $2.4 billion , of which $1.6 billion to $2.0 billion are expected to be recorded as exit and disposal activities. - 75 - Costs related to exit and disposal activities under the Transformational Cost Management Program, which were primarily recorded in selling, general and administrative expenses included in the fiscal year ended August 31, 2019 were as follows (in millions): ##TABLE_START Twelve Months Ended August 31, 2019 Retail Pharmacy USA  Retail Pharmacy International  Pharmaceutical Wholesale  Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc.

As of the date of this report, the Company expects to close approximately 750 stores, of which the majority have been closed as part of this program. The actions under the Store Optimization Program commenced in March 2018 and are expected to be complete by end of fiscal 2020. The Company currently estimates that it will recognize cumulative pre-tax charges to its GAAP financial results of approximately $350 million , including costs associated with lease obligations and other real estate costs, employee severance and other exit costs. The Company expects to incur pre-tax charges of approximately $160 million for lease obligations and other real estate costs and approximately $190 million for employee severance and other exit costs. The Company estimates that substantially all of these cumulative pre-tax charges will result in cash expenditures. Since approval of the Store Optimization Program, the Company has recognized cumulative pre-tax charges to its financial results in accordance with GAAP totaling $296 million , which were primarily recorded within selling, general and administrative expenses. These charges included $138 million related to lease obligations and other real estate costs and $158 million employee severance and other exit costs. - 76 - Costs related to the Store Optimization Program, which were primarily recorded in selling, general and administrative expenses for the Company's Retail Pharmacy USA segment included in the fiscal years ended August 31, 2019 and 2018 , are as follows (in millions): ##TABLE_START   Lease obligations and other real estate costs $  $ Employee severance and other exit costs  Total costs $  $ ##TABLE_ENDThe changes in liabilities related to the Store Optimization Program for the fiscal years ended August 31, 2019 and 2018 include the following (in millions): ##TABLE_START  Lease obligations and other real estate costs  Employee severance and other exit costs  Total Balance at August 31, 2017 $   $   $  Costs   Payments (18 )  (60 )  (78 ) Other - non cash 1    Balance at August 31, 2018 $  $  $ Costs   Payments (171 )  (69 )  (240 ) Other - non cash 1  (7 )  Balance at August 31, 2019 $  $  $ ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START 1  Primarily represents unfavorable lease liabilities from acquired Rite Aid stores. ##TABLE_END Cost Transformation Program On April 8, 2015, the Walgreens Boots Alliance Board of Directors approved a plan to implement a restructuring program (the Cost Transformation Program) as part of an initiative to reduce costs and increase operating efficiencies.

The Company accounts for its equity investment in AmerisourceBergen using the equity method of accounting, with the net earnings attributable to the Companys investment being classified within the operating income of its Pharmaceutical Wholesale segment. Due to the timing and availability of financial information of AmerisourceBergen, the Company accounts for this equity method investment on a financial reporting lag of two months. Equity earnings from AmerisourceBergen are reported as a separate line in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings. The financial performance of AmerisourceBergen, including any charges which may arise relating to its ongoing opioid litigation, will impact the Companys results of operations. The Level 1 fair market value of the Companys equity investment in AmerisourceBergen common stock at August 31, 2019 and 2018 were $4.7 billion and $5.1 billion , respectively. As of August 31, 2019 , the Companys investment in AmerisourceBergen carrying value exceeded its proportionate share of the net assets of AmerisourceBergen by $4.4 billion . This premium of $4.4 billion was recognized as part of the carrying value in the Companys equity investment in AmerisourceBergen. The difference was primarily related to goodwill and the fair value of AmerisourceBergen intangible assets.  Other investments The Companys other equity method investments include its investments in Guangzhou Pharmaceuticals Corporation (Guangzhou Pharmaceuticals) and Nanjing Pharmaceutical Corporation Limited, the Companys pharmaceutical wholesale investments in China; its investment in Sinopharm Holding Guoda Drugstores Co., Ltd., the Company's retail pharmacy investment in China, the Companys investment in BioScrip (resulting from its merger with Option Care Inc.) and PharMerica Corporation in the United States. The Company reported $23 million , $53 million and $8 million of post-tax equity earnings from other equity method investments, including equity method investments classified as operating, for the fiscal years ended 2019 , 2018 and 2017 , respectively. During the fiscal year ended August 31, 2018 , the Company recorded an impairment of $170 million in its equity interest in Guangzhou Pharmaceuticals, which was included in other income (expense) in the Consolidated Statement of Earnings. The fair value of the Companys equity interest in Guangzhou Pharmaceuticals was determined using the proposed sale price and thus represents Level 3 measurement. During the fiscal year ended August 31, 2018 , the Company completed the sale of a 30 percent interest in Guangzhou Pharmaceuticals to its joint venture partner Guangzhou Baiyunshan Pharmaceutical Holdings resulting in a $172 million reduction in carrying value and a $8 million cumulative translation adjustment loss. In July 2018, the Company completed the sale of its minority equity interest in Premise Health Holding Corp., resulting in an after-tax gain on disposition of $ 245 million and a reduction in carrying value of $ 76 million . - 79 - Summarized financial information Summarized financial information for the Companys equity method investments in aggregate is as follows: Balance sheet (in millions) ##TABLE_START  Year ended August 31,   Current assets $ 36,523  $ 34,493 Non-current assets 15,710  14,971 Current liabilities 35,857  34,055 Non-current liabilities 9,633  8,759 Shareholders equity 1 6,743  6,650 ##TABLE_ENDStatements of earnings (in millions) ##TABLE_START  Year ended August 31,    Sales $ 197,237  $ 179,887  $ 164,844 Gross profit 7,516  6,875  5,958 Net earnings 1,037  1,315  1,040 Share of earnings from equity method investments   ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START 1  Shareholders equity at August 31, 2019 and 2018 includes  $ 411 million and $ 445 million , respectively, related to noncontrolling interests. ##TABLE_END  The summarized financial information for equity method investments has been included on an aggregated basis for all investments as reported at the end of each fiscal year end. Note 6 . Goodwill and other intangible assets Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are evaluated for impairment annually or more frequently if an event occurs or circumstances change that could more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit or intangible asset below its carrying value. Based on this annual evaluation as of June 1, 2019 valuation date, the fair values of the Companys reporting units exceeded their carrying amounts ranging from approximately 9% to approximately 269% . The fair value of the Boots reporting unit, within the Retail Pharmacy International segment, is in excess of its carrying value by approximately 9% . As at August 31, 2019 , the carrying value of the goodwill of the Boots reporting unit is $2.6 billion . The fair values of certain indefinite-lived intangibles within the Boots reporting unit exceeded their carrying amounts ranging from approximately 3% to approximately 29% , except for the pharmacy licenses. As at August 31, 2019 , the carrying value of these indefinite-lived intangibles within the Boots reporting unit is $6.9 billion . As a result of an annual evaluation, during the three months ended August 31, 2019 , the Company recorded an impairment of $73 million on its pharmacy licenses in the Boots reporting unit, which was included in selling, general and administrative expenses in the Consolidated Statement of Earnings. The fair value of pharmacy licenses was determined using excess earnings method and thus represents Level 3 measurement. The Company continues to closely monitor industry and market trends and the impact it may have on the Boots reporting unit and indefinite-lived intangibles as the challenging market conditions in the UK continued to impact the operating performance of the Boots reporting unit during the three months ended August 31, 2019 .  The fair value for each reporting unit is estimated using both the income and market approaches. The income approach requires management to estimate a number of factors for each reporting unit, including projected future operating results, economic projections, anticipated future cash flows and discount rates. The market approach estimates fair value using comparable marketplace fair value data from within a comparable industry grouping. The determination of the fair value of the reporting units requires us to make significant estimates and assumptions. These estimates and assumptions primarily include, but are not limited to: the selection of appropriate peer group companies, control premiums appropriate for acquisitions in the industries in which we compete, discount rates, terminal growth rates, forecasts of revenue, operating income, depreciation, amortization and capital expenditures. Indefinite-lived intangible assets fair values are estimated using the relief from royalty method and excess earnings method of the income approach. These estimates can be affected by a number of factors including, but not - 80 - limited to, general economic conditions, availability of market information as well as our profitability. Although the Company believes its estimates of fair value are reasonable, actual financial results could differ from those estimates due to the inherent uncertainty involved in making such estimates. Changes in assumptions concerning future financial results or other underlying assumptions could have a significant impact on either the fair value of the reporting units, the amount of the goodwill impairment charge, or both.

The credit facilities contain various other customary covenants. Commercial paper The Company periodically borrows under its commercial paper program and may borrow under it in future periods. The Company had average daily commercial paper outstanding of $2.7 billion at a weighted average interest rate of 3.07% for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2019 . The Company had average daily commercial paper outstanding of $1.4 billion at a weighted average interest rate of 2.11% for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2018 .  Interest Interest paid was $676 million in fiscal 2019 , $577 million in fiscal 2018 and $643 million in fiscal 2017 . Note 8 . Financial instruments - 84 - The Company uses derivative instruments to manage its exposure to interest rate and foreign currency exchange risks. The Company has non-U.S. dollar denominated net investments and uses foreign currency denominated financial instruments, specifically foreign currency derivatives and foreign currency denominated debt, to hedge its foreign currency risk. The Company utilizes foreign currency forward contracts and other foreign currency derivatives to hedge significant committed and highly probable future transactions and cash flows denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the Company or its subsidiaries. The Company uses interest rate swaps from time to time to manage the interest rate exposure associated with some of its fixed-rate debt and designates them as fair value hedges. From time to time, the Company uses forward starting interest rate swaps to hedge its interest rate exposure of some of its anticipated debt issuances. The notional amount and fair value of derivative instruments outstanding were as follows (in millions): ##TABLE_START August 31, 2019  Notional  Fair value  Location in Consolidated Balance Sheets Derivatives designated as hedges :       Cross currency interest rate swap  $ $  Other non-current assets Foreign currency forwards    Other current assets Derivatives not designated as hedges :       Foreign currency forwards  3,485  Other current assets Foreign currency forwards  6  Other current liabilities ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START August 31, 2018  Notional  Fair value  Location in Consolidated Balance Sheets Derivatives designated as hedges :       Interest rate swaps  $  $  Other non-current liabilities Foreign currency forwards  $    Other current assets Derivatives not designated as hedges :       Foreign currency forwards  3,273   Other current assets Foreign currency forwards    Other current liabilities ##TABLE_END Net investment hedges The Company uses cross currency interest rate swaps as hedges of net investments in subsidiaries with non-U.S. dollar functional currencies. For qualifying net investment hedges, changes in the fair value of the derivatives are recorded in the currency translation adjustment within accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). Derivatives not designated as hedges The Company enters into derivative transactions that are not designated as accounting hedges. These derivative instruments are economic hedges of foreign currency risks. The income and (expense) due to changes in fair value of these derivative instruments were recognized in earnings as follows (in millions): ##TABLE_START   Location in Consolidated Statements of Earnings    Foreign currency forwards  Selling, general and administrative expense  $  $  $ Foreign currency forwards  Other income (expense)  (18 )   (48 ) ##TABLE_ENDDerivatives credit risk Counterparties to derivative financial instruments expose the Company to credit-related losses in the event of counterparty nonperformance, and the Company regularly monitors the credit worthiness of each counterparty. Derivatives offsetting The Company does not offset the fair value amounts of derivative instruments subject to master netting agreements in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Note 9 . Fair value measurements - 85 - The Company measures certain assets and liabilities in accordance with ASC Topic 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures, which defines fair value as the price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. In addition, it establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes observable and unobservable inputs used to measure fair value into three broad Levels: ##TABLE_START Level 1 - Quoted prices in active markets that are accessible at the measurement date for identical assets and liabilities. The fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to Level 1 inputs. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START Level 2 - Observable inputs other than quoted prices in active markets. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START Level 3 - Unobservable inputs for which there is little or no market data available. The fair value hierarchy gives the lowest priority to Level 3 inputs. ##TABLE_END Assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis were as follows (in millions): ##TABLE_START   August 31, 2019  Level 1  Level 2  Level 3 Assets :         Money market funds 1  $  $  $   $  Investments in equity securities 2       Foreign currency forwards 3       Cross Currency interest rate swaps 4       Liabilities :         Foreign currency forwards 3       ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START   August 31, 2018  Level 1  Level 2  Level 3 Assets :         Money market funds 1  $  $  $   $  Available-for-sale investments 2       Foreign currency forwards 3       Liabilities:         Interest rate swaps 4       Foreign currency forwards 3       ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START 1  Money market funds are valued at the closing price reported by the fund sponsor. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START 2  Fair values of quoted investments are based on current bid prices as of August 31, 2019 and 2018 . ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START 3  The fair value of forward currency contracts is estimated by discounting the difference between the contractual forward price and the current available forward price for the residual maturity of the contract using observable market rates. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START 4  The fair value of interest rate swaps and cross currency interest rate swaps is calculated by discounting the estimated future cash flows based on the applicable observable yield curves. See note 8 , financial instruments , for additional information. ##TABLE_END There were no transfers between Levels in fiscal 2019 or 2018 . The Company reports its debt instruments under the guidance of ASC Topic 825, Financial Instruments, which requires disclosure of the fair value of the Companys debt in the footnotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Unless otherwise noted, the fair value for all notes was determined based upon quoted market prices and therefore categorized as Level 1. See note 7 , debt , for further information. The carrying values of accounts receivable and trade accounts payable approximated their respective fair values due to their short-term nature. Note 10 . Commitments and contingencies The Company is involved in legal proceedings, including litigation, arbitration and other claims, and investigations, inspections, subpoenas, audits, claims, inquiries and similar actions by pharmacy, healthcare, tax and other governmental authorities, arising in the normal course of the Companys business, including the matters described below. Legal proceedings, in general, and securities, class action and multi-district litigation, in particular, can be expensive and disruptive. Some of these suits may purport or may be determined to be class actions and/or involve parties seeking large and/or indeterminate amounts, including punitive or exemplary damages, and may remain unresolved for several years. From time to time, the Company is - 86 - also involved in legal proceedings as a plaintiff involving antitrust, tax, contract, intellectual property and other matters. Gain contingencies, if any, are recognized when they are realized. Like other companies in the retail pharmacy and pharmaceutical wholesale industries, the Company is subject to extensive regulation by national, state and local government agencies in the United States and other countries in which it operates. There continues to be a heightened level of review and/or audit by regulatory authorities of, and increased litigation regarding, the Companys and the rest of the health care and related industrys business, compliance and reporting practices. As a result, the Company regularly is the subject of government actions of the types described above. The Company also may be named from time to time in qui tam actions initiated by private third parties. In such actions, the private parties purport to act on behalf of federal or state governments, allege that false claims have been submitted for payment by the government and may receive an award if their claims are successful. After a private party has filed a qui tam action, the government must investigate the private party's claim and determine whether to intervene in and take control over the litigation. These actions may remain under seal while the government makes this determination. If the government declines to intervene, the private party may nonetheless continue to pursue the litigation on his or her own purporting to act on behalf of the government. The results of legal proceedings, including government investigations, are often uncertain and difficult to predict, and the costs incurred in these matters can be substantial, regardless of the outcome. With respect to litigation and other legal proceedings where the Company has determined that a loss is reasonably possible, the Company is unable to estimate the amount or range of reasonably possible loss due to the inherent difficulty of predicting the outcome of and uncertainties regarding such litigation and legal proceedings. The Company believes that its defenses and assertions in pending legal proceedings have merit and does not believe that any of these pending matters, after consideration of applicable reserves and rights to indemnification, will have a material adverse effect on the Companys consolidated financial position. However, substantial unanticipated verdicts, fines and rulings do sometimes occur. As a result, the Company could from time to time incur judgments, enter into settlements or revise its expectations regarding the outcome of certain matters, and such developments could have a material adverse effect on its results of operations in the period in which the amounts are accrued and/or its cash flows in the period in which the amounts are paid. In addition, as a result of governmental investigations or proceedings, the Company may be subject to damages, civil or criminal fines or penalties, or other sanctions, including the possible suspension or loss of licensure and/or suspension or exclusion from participation in government programs. On December 29, 2014, a putative shareholder filed a derivative action in federal court in the Northern District of Illinois against certain current and former directors and officers of Walgreen Co., and Walgreen Co. as a nominal defendant, arising out of certain public statements the Company made regarding its former fiscal 2016 goals. The action asserts claims for breach of fiduciary duty, waste and unjust enrichment. On April 10, 2015, the defendants filed a motion to dismiss. On May 18, 2015, the case was stayed in light of a securities class action that was filed on April 10, 2015. After a ruling issued on September 30, 2016 in the securities class action, which is described below, on November 3, 2016, the Court entered a stipulation and order extending the stay until the resolution of the securities class action. On April 10, 2015, a putative shareholder filed a securities class action in federal court in the Northern District of Illinois against Walgreen Co. and certain former officers of Walgreen Co. The action asserts claims for violation of the federal securities laws arising out of certain public statements the Company made regarding its former fiscal 2016 goals. On June 16, 2015, the Court entered an order appointing a lead plaintiff. Pursuant to the Courts order, lead plaintiff filed a consolidated class action complaint on August 17, 2015, and defendants moved to dismiss the complaint on October 16, 2015. On September 30, 2016, the Court issued an order granting in part and denying in part defendants motion to dismiss. Defendants filed their answer to the complaint on November 4, 2016 and filed an amended answer on January 16, 2017. Plaintiff filed its motion for class certification on April 21, 2017. The Court granted plaintiffs motion on March 29, 2018 and merits discovery is proceeding. On December 19, 2018, plaintiffs filed a first amended complaint and defendants moved to dismiss the new complaint on February 19, 2019. On September 23, 2019, the Court issued an order granting in part and denying in part defendants motion to dismiss. On December 11, 2017, purported Rite Aid shareholders filed an amended complaint in a putative class action lawsuit in the United States District Court for the Middle District of Pennsylvania (the M.D. Pa. action) arising out of transactions contemplated by the merger agreement between the Company and Rite Aid. The amended complaint alleged that the Company and certain of its officers made false or misleading statements regarding the transactions. The Court denied the Companys motion to dismiss the amended complaint on April 15, 2019. The Company filed an answer and affirmative defenses, discovery commenced, and plaintiffs have filed a motion for class certification. The Companys response to that motion is due on November 21, 2019. - 87 - In June 2019, a Freds, Inc. shareholder filed a nearly identical lawsuit to the M.D. Pa. action in the United States District Court for the Western District of Tennessee, except naming Freds, Inc. and one of its former officers along with the Company and certain of its officers. Lead plaintiffs will file an amended complaint on or before November 4, 2019. As previously disclosed, the Company was also named as a defendant in a putative class action lawsuit similar to the M.D. Pa. action filed in State of Pennsylvania in the Court of Common Pleas of Cumberland County, which was terminated by the court for lack of prosecution in November 2018. In December 2017, the United States Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation consolidated numerous cases filed against an array of defendants by various plaintiffs such as counties, cities, hospitals, Indian tribes and others, alleging claims generally concerning the impacts of widespread opioid abuse. The consolidated multidistrict litigation (MDL), captioned In re National Prescription Opiate Litigation (MDL No. 2804), is pending in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Ohio. The Company is named as a defendant in a subset of the cases included in this MDL. The first trial in the MDL that had been scheduled for October 2019 was terminated. The MDL court will address next steps in a scheduling conference that has not yet been set. The Company also has been named as a defendant in numerous lawsuits brought in state courts relating to opioid matters. The relief sought by various plaintiffs is compensatory and punitive damages, as well as injunctive relief. Additionally, the Company has received from the Attorney Generals of several states subpoenas, civil investigative demands, and/or other requests concerning opioid matters. On September 28, 2018, the Company announced that it had reached an agreement with the SEC to fully resolve an investigation into certain forward-looking financial goals and related disclosures by Walgreens. The disclosures at issue were made prior to the strategic combination with Alliance Boots and the merger pursuant to which Walgreens Boots Alliance became the parent holding company on December 31, 2014. The settlement does not involve any of the Companys current officers or executives, nor does it allege intentional or reckless conduct by the Company. In agreeing to the settlement, the Company neither admitted nor denied the SECs allegations. Pursuant to the agreement with the SEC, the Company consented to the SECs issuance of an administrative order, and the Company paid a $34.5 million penalty, which was fully reserved for in the Companys Consolidated Financial Statements as of August 31, 2018. On January 22, 2019, the Company announced that it had reached an agreement to resolve a civil investigation involving allegations under the False Claims Act by a United States Attorneys Office, working in conjunction with several states, regarding certain dispensing practices. Pursuant to the agreement, the Company paid $209.2 million to the United States and the various states involved in the matter, substantially all of which was reserved for in the Companys Consolidated Financial Statements as of November 30, 2018. Note 11 . Income taxes U.S. tax law changes In connection with the U.S. tax law changes enacted in December 2017 and in accordance with SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin 118 (SAB 118), the Company completed its analysis of the income tax effects of the U.S. tax law changes during the three months ended February 28, 2019. The incremental net tax benefit recorded upon completion of the analysis of the income tax effects of the U.S. tax law changes was not material to our Consolidated Financial Statements.  In fiscal 2018, as a direct result of the U.S. tax law changes, the Company performed preliminary analysis and recorded a provisional estimated net tax benefit of $125 million . This provisional net tax benefit arose from a benefit of $648 million from re-measuring the Companys net U.S. deferred tax liabilities, partially offset by the Companys accrual for the transition tax and other U.S. tax law changes of $523 million . In fiscal 2019, the Company finalized its provisional estimates and recognized incremental net income tax expense, which was not material to our Consolidated Financial Statements, upon completing the accounting related to the U.S. tax law changes, primarily related to the refinement of the transition tax expense on the one-time mandatory repatriation of previously untaxed earnings of foreign subsidiaries. The U.S. tax law changes include broad and complex changes. Among other things, the U.S. tax law changes reduced the federal corporate tax rate from 35% to 21% effective January 1, 2018 and required companies to immediately accrue for a one-time transition tax on certain un-repatriated earnings of foreign subsidiaries, which is generally payable over an eight-year period. The U.S. tax law changes modified the taxation of foreign earnings, repealed the deduction for domestic production activities, limited interest deductibility and established a global intangible low tax income (GILTI) regime. The lower corporate income tax rate of 21% became effective January 1, 2018 and was phased in as a result of our August 31 fiscal year-end. This resulted in a blended U.S. statutory federal tax rate of approximately 26% for fiscal 2018. This statutory - 88 - federal tax rate is 21% for fiscal 2019 and subsequent fiscal years, which provided a benefit to the Companys fiscal 2019 tax provision of approximately $89 million . During 2019, the U.S. Treasury Department issued regulations to apply retroactively covering certain components of the 2017 U.S. tax law changes. Certain guidance included in these regulations is inconsistent with the Companys interpretation that led to the recognition of $247 million of tax benefits in prior periods. Despite this new guidance, the Company remains confident in its interpretation of the U.S. tax law changes and intends to defend this position through litigation, if necessary. However, if the Company is ultimately unsuccessful in defending its position, it may be required to reverse all or a portion of the benefits previously recorded. By establishing the GILTI regime, the Act created a minimum tax on certain foreign sourced earnings. The taxability of the foreign earnings and the applicable tax rates are dependent on future events. The Companys accounting policy for the minimum tax on foreign sourced earnings is to report the tax effects on the basis that the minimum tax will be recognized in tax expense in the year it is incurred as a period expense. As the Company repatriates the undistributed earnings of its foreign subsidiaries for use in the United States, the earnings from its foreign subsidiaries will generally not be subject to U.S. federal tax. The Company continuously evaluates the amount of foreign earnings that are not necessary to be permanently reinvested in its foreign subsidiaries. The components of earnings before income tax provision were (in millions): ##TABLE_START     U.S.  $ 1,898  $ 3,292  $ 1,953 NonU.S.  2,629  2,683  2,900 Total  $ 4,527  $ 5,975  $ 4,853 ##TABLE_ENDThe provision for income taxes consists of the following (in millions): ##TABLE_START     Current provision       Federal  $  $  $ State    NonU.S.       1,322  1,194 Deferred provision       Federal  tax law change    (648 )   Federal  excluding tax law change    (306 ) State    (24 ) NonU.S.  tax law change      (80 ) NonU.S.  excluding tax law change  (55 )  (58 )  (24 )    (324 )  (434 ) Income tax provision  $  $  $ ##TABLE_END - 89 - The difference between the statutory federal income tax rate and the effective tax rate is as follows: ##TABLE_START     Federal statutory rate  21.0 %  25.7 %  35.0 % State income taxes, net of federal benefit  0.9  2.3  0.3 Foreign income taxed at non-U.S. rates  (2.1 )  (12.2 )  (11.8 ) Non-taxable income  (3.5 )  (5.2 )  (5.3 ) Non-deductible expenses  0.5  2.1  1.5 Transition tax    12.4   Tax law changes  (0.4 )  (10.9 )  (1.6 ) Change in valuation allowance 1  1.9  8.7  0.7 Tax credits  (4.8 )  (6.9 )  (2.9 ) Other  (0.5 )  0.7  (0.2 ) Effective income tax rate  13.0 %  16.7 %  15.7 % ##TABLE_END1 Net of changes in related tax attributes.

In addition, these deferred tax assets include $61 million of income tax credits. Of these deferred tax assets, $6.4 billion will expire at various dates from 2020 through 2036. The residual deferred tax assets of $248 million have no expiry date. The Company believes it is more likely than not that the benefit from certain deferred tax assets will not be realized. In recognition of this risk, the Company has recorded a valuation allowance of $6.6 billion against those deferred tax assets as of August 31, 2019 . Income taxes paid, net of refunds were $0.9 billion , $0.6 billion and $1.1 billion for fiscal years 2019 , 2018 and 2017 , respectively. - 90 - ASC Topic 740, Income Taxes, provides guidance regarding the recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure in the financial statement of tax positions taken or expected to be taken on a tax return, including the decision whether to file in a particular jurisdiction. As of August 31, 2019 , unrecognized tax benefits of $499 million were reported as long-term liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets while an immaterial amount is reported as current tax liabilities. Both of these amounts include interest and penalties, when applicable. The following table provides a reconciliation of the total amounts of unrecognized tax benefits (in millions): ##TABLE_START     Balance at beginning of year  $  $  $ Gross increases related to tax positions in a prior period    Gross decreases related to tax positions in a prior period  (53 )  (15 )  (36 ) Gross increases related to tax positions in the current period    Settlements with taxing authorities  (2 )  (87 )  (2 ) Currency      (1 ) Lapse of statute of limitations  (5 )  (3 )  (5 ) Balance at end of year  $  $  $ ##TABLE_ENDAt August 31, 2019 , 2018 and 2017 , $311 million , $331 million and $286 million , respectively, of unrecognized tax benefits would favorably impact the effective tax rate if recognized. During the next twelve months, based on current knowledge, it is reasonably possible the amount of unrecognized tax benefits could decrease by up to $16 million due to anticipated tax audit settlements and the expirations of statutes of limitations associated with tax positions related to multiple tax jurisdictions. The Company recognizes interest and penalties in the income tax provision in its Consolidated Statements of Earnings. At August 31, 2019 and August 31, 2018 , the Company had accrued interest and penalties of $47 million and $87 million , respectively. For the year ended August 31, 2019 , the amount reported in income tax expense related to interest and penalties was $40 million income tax benefit.  The Company files a consolidated U.S. federal income tax return as well as income tax returns in various states and multiple foreign jurisdictions. It is generally no longer under audit examinations for U.S. federal income tax purposes for any years prior to fiscal 2014. With few exceptions, it is no longer subject to state and local income tax examinations by tax authorities for years before fiscal 2007. In foreign tax jurisdictions, the Company is generally no longer subject to examination by the tax authorities in the United Kingdom prior to 2015, Luxembourg prior to 2013, in Germany prior to 2014, in France prior to 2008 and in Turkey prior to 2014.  The Company has received tax holidays from Swiss cantonal income taxes relative to certain of its Swiss operations. The income tax holidays are expected to extend through September 2022. The holidays had a beneficial impact of $127 million and $127 million (inclusive of capital GILTI tax cost) during fiscal 2019 and 2018 , respectively. This benefit is primarily included as part of the foreign income taxed at non-U.S. rates line in the effective tax rate reconciliation table above. At August 31, 2019 , it is not practicable for the Company to determine the amount of the unrecognized deferred tax liability it has with respect to temporary differences related to investments in foreign subsidiaries and foreign corporate joint ventures that are essentially permanent in duration. Note 12 . Stock compensation plans The Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. 2013 Omnibus Incentive Plan (the Omnibus Plan), which became effective in fiscal 2013, provides for incentive compensation to the Companys non-employee directors, officers and employees and consolidates several previously existing equity compensation plans into a single plan. The Company grants stock options, performance shares and restricted units under the Omnibus Plan. Performance shares issued under the Omnibus Plan offer performance-based incentive awards and equity-based awards to key employees. The fair value of each performance share granted assumes that performance goals will be achieved at 100 percent . If such goals are not met, no compensation expense is recognized and any recognized compensation expense is reversed. Restricted stock units are also equity-based awards with performance requirements that are granted to key employees. The performance shares and restricted stock unit awards are both subject to restrictions as to continuous employment except in the case of death, normal retirement or total and permanent disability. - 91 -  Total stock-based compensation expense for fiscal 2019 , 2018 and 2017 was $119 million , $130 million and $91 million , respectively. The recognized tax benefit was $43 million , $43 million and $78 million for fiscal 2019 , 2018 and 2017 , respectively. Unrecognized compensation cost related to non-vested awards at August 31, 2019 was $172 million , which will be recognized over three years . Note 13 . Retirement benefits The Company sponsors several retirement plans, including defined benefit plans, defined contribution plans and a postretirement health plan. Defined benefit pension plans (non-U.S. plans) The Company has various defined benefit pension plans outside the United States. The principal defined benefit pension plan is the Boots Pension Plan (the Boots Plan), which covers certain employees in the United Kingdom. The Boots Plan is a funded final salary defined benefit plan providing pensions and death benefits to members. The Boots Plan was closed to future accrual effective July 1, 2010, with pensions calculated based on salaries up until that date. The Boots Plan is governed by a trustee board, which is independent of the Company. The plan is subject to a full funding actuarial valuation on a triennial basis.  The investment strategy of the principal defined benefit pension plan is to hold approximately 85% of its assets in a diverse portfolio which aims to broadly match the characteristics of the plans liabilities by investing in bonds, derivatives and other fixed income assets, with the remainder invested in predominantly return-seeking assets. Interest rate and inflation rate swaps are also employed to complement the role of fixed and index-linked bond holdings in liability risk management. The following tables present classes of defined benefit pension plan assets by fair value hierarchy (in millions): ##TABLE_START   August 31, 2019  Level 1  Level 2  Level 3 Equity securities :         Equity securities 1  $ 1,006  $   $ 1,005  $           Debt securities:         Fixed interest government bonds 2      Index linked government bonds 2  3,861  3,824    Corporate bonds 3  2,390   2,389            Real estate:         Real estate 4                Other :         Other investments 5              Total  $ 9,131  $ 4,036  $ 4,288  $ ##TABLE_END- 92 - ##TABLE_START   August 31, 2018  Level 1  Level 2  Level 3 Equity securities :         Equity securities 1  $ 1,030  $   $ 1,030  $           Debt securities:         Fixed interest government bonds 2       Index linked government bonds 2  2,880    2,880   Corporate bonds 3  2,542    2,536           Real estate:         Real estate 4                Other :         Other investments 5              Total  $ 8,676  $  $ 7,878  $ ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START 1  Equity securities, which mainly comprise investments in commingled funds, are valued based on quoted prices and are primarily exchange-traded. Securities for which official close or last trade pricing on an active exchange is available are classified as Level 1 investments. If closing prices are not available, or the investments are in a commingled fund, ##TABLE_END securities are valued at the last quoted bid price and typically are categorized as Level 2 investments. ##TABLE_START 2  Debt securities: government bonds comprise fixed interest and index linked bonds issued by central governments and are valued based on quotes received from independent pricing services or from dealers who make markets in such securities. Pricing services utilize pricing which considers readily available inputs such as the yield or price of bonds of comparable quality, coupon, maturity and type, as well as dealer-supplied prices. Certain government bonds which were categorized as Level 2 investments in fiscal 2018 were deemed to be classified as Level 1 in fiscal 2019. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START 3  Debt securities: corporate bonds comprise bonds issued by corporations in both segregated and commingled funds ##TABLE_END and are valued using recently executed transactions, or quoted market prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets, or for identical assets and liabilities in markets that are not active. If there have been no market transactions in a particular fixed income security, its fair value is calculated by pricing models that benchmark the security against other securities with actual market prices. Certain corporate bonds which were categorized as Level 2 investments in fiscal 2018 were deemed to be classified as Level 1 in fiscal 2019. ##TABLE_START 4  Real estate comprises investments in certain property funds which are valued based on the underlying properties. These properties are valued using a number of standard industry techniques such as cost, discounted cash flows, independent appraisals and market based comparable data. Real estate investments are categorized as Level 3 investments. Changes in Level 3 investments during fiscal 2019 were driven by actual return on plan assets still held at August 31, 2019 and purchases during the year. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START 5  Other investments mainly comprise cash and cash equivalents, derivatives and direct private placements. Cash is categorized as a Level 1 investment and cash in commingled funds is categorized as Level 2 investments. Cash equivalents are valued using observable yield curves, discounting and interest rates and are categorized as Level 2 investments. Derivatives which are exchange-traded and for which market quotations are readily available are valued at the last reported sale price or official closing price as reported by an independent pricing service on the primary market, or exchange on which they are traded, and are categorized as Level 1 investments. Over-the-counter derivatives typically are valued by independent pricing services and are categorized as Level 2 investments. Direct private placements are typically bonds valued by reference to comparable bonds and are categorized as Level 3 investments. Changes in Level 3 investments during fiscal 2019 were primarily driven by purchases during the year. ##TABLE_END Components of net periodic pension costs for the defined benefit pension plans (in millions): ##TABLE_START   Boots and other pension plans     Service costs  $  $  $ Interest costs    Expected returns on plan assets/other  (246 )  (209 )  (146 ) Total net periodic pension (income) cost  $ (46 )  $ (11 )  $ ##TABLE_END- 93 - Change in benefit obligations for the defined benefit pension plans (in millions): ##TABLE_START    Benefit obligation at beginning of year  $ 8,293  $ 8,880 Service costs   Interest costs   Amendments/other   (4 ) Net actuarial loss (gain)  1,212  (466 ) Benefits paid  (363 )  (398 ) Currency translation adjustments  (530 )  Benefit obligation at end of year  $ 8,834  $ 8,293 ##TABLE_ENDChange in plan assets for the defined benefit pension plans (in millions): ##TABLE_START    Plan assets at fair value at beginning of year  $ 8,676  $ 8,980 Employer contributions   Benefits paid  (363 )  (398 ) Return on assets/other  1,333  (55 ) Currency translation adjustments  (552 )  Plan assets at fair value at end of year  $ 9,131  $ 8,676 ##TABLE_END Amounts recognized in the Consolidated Balance Sheets (in millions): ##TABLE_START    Other non-current assets  $  $ Accrued expenses and other liabilities  (6 )  (7 ) Other non-current liabilities  (183 )  (164 ) Net asset (liability) recognized at end of year  $  $ ##TABLE_END Cumulative pre-tax amounts recognized in accumulated other comprehensive (income) loss (in millions): ##TABLE_START    Net actuarial (gain) loss  $  $ (27 ) Prior service cost    Total   (27 ) ##TABLE_END The projected benefit obligation, accumulated benefit obligation and fair value of plan assets for all pension plans, including accumulated benefit obligations in excess of plan assets, at August 31 were as follows (in millions): ##TABLE_START    Projected benefit obligation  $ 8,834  $ 8,293 Accumulated benefit obligation  8,823  8,285 Fair value of plan assets  9,131  8,676 ##TABLE_ENDPension plans with projected benefit obligation and accumulated benefit obligations in excess of plan assets were not material for periods presented.

Defined contribution plans The principal retirement plan for U.S. employees is the Walgreen Profit-Sharing Retirement Trust, to which both the Company and participating employees contribute. The Companys contribution is in the form of a guaranteed match which is made pursuant to the applicable plan document approved by the Walgreen Co. Board of Directors. Plan activity is reviewed periodically by certain Committees of the Walgreens Boots Alliance Board of Directors. The profit-sharing provision was an expense of $239 million , $217 million and $221 million in fiscal 2019 , 2018 and 2017 , respectively. The Companys contributions were $234 million , $ 366 million and $ 220 million in fiscal 2019 , 2018 and 2017 , respectively. The Company also has certain contract based defined contribution arrangements. The principal one is the Alliance Healthcare  Boots Retirement Savings Plan, which is United Kingdom based and to which both the Company and participating employees contribute. The cost recognized in the Consolidated Statement of Earnings was $124 million in fiscal 2019 , $142 million in fiscal 2018 and $112 million in fiscal 2017 .  Postretirement healthcare plan The Company provides certain health insurance benefits to retired U.S. employees who meet eligibility requirements, including age, years of service and date of hire. The costs of these benefits are accrued over the service life of the employee. An amendment to this plan during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018 resulted in a reduction in the benefit plan obligation of $201 million and the recognition of a curtailment gain of $112 million . An amendment during the third quarter of fiscal 2017 resulted in the recognition of a curtailment gain of $109 million . The Companys postretirement health benefit plan obligation was $161 million and $146 million in fiscal 2019 and 2018 , respectively and is not funded. The expected benefit to be paid net of the estimated federal subsidy during fiscal year 2020 is $8 million . Note 14 . Capital stock In connection with the Companys capital policy, the Board of Directors has authorized share repurchase programs. In April 2017, Walgreens Boots Alliance authorized a stock repurchase program (the April 2017 stock repurchase program), which authorized the repurchase of up to $1.0 billion of Walgreens Boots Alliance common stock prior to the programs expiration on December 31, 2017. In May 2017, the Company completed the April 2017 stock repurchase program, purchasing 11.8 million shares. In June 2017, Walgreens Boots Alliance authorized a new stock repurchase program, which authorized the repurchase of up to $5.0 billion of Walgreens Boots Alliance common stock prior to the programs expiration on August 31, 2018, which - 95 - authorization was increased by an additional $1.0 billion in October 2017 (as expanded, the June 2017 stock repurchase program). The June 2017 stock repurchase program was completed in October 2017. In June 2018, Walgreens Boots Alliance authorized a new stock repurchase program, which authorized the repurchase of up to $10.0 billion of Walgreens Boots Alliance common stock, which program has no specified expiration date. The Company purchased 57 million and 72 million shares under stock repurchase programs in fiscal 2019 and 2018 at a cost of $3.8 billion and $4.9 billion , respectively. The Company determines the timing and amount of repurchases based on its assessment of various factors including prevailing market conditions, alternate uses of capital, liquidity, the economic environment and other factors. The timing and amount of these purchases may change at any time and from time to time. The Company has repurchased, and may from time to time in the future repurchase, shares on the open market through Rule 10b5-1 plans, which enable a company to repurchase shares at times when it otherwise might be precluded from doing so under insider trading laws. In addition, the Company continued to repurchase shares to support the needs of the employee stock plans. Shares totaling $339 million were purchased to support the needs of the employee stock plans during fiscal 2019 as compared to $289 million and $457 million in fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2017 , respectively. At August 31, 2019 , 25 million shares of common stock were reserved for future issuances under the Companys various employee benefit plans. Note 15 .

Segment reporting The Company has aligned its operations into three reportable segments: Retail Pharmacy USA, Retail Pharmacy International and Pharmaceutical Wholesale. The operating segments have been identified based on the financial data utilized by the Companys Chief Executive Officer (the chief operating decision maker) to assess segment performance and allocate resources among the Companys operating segments. The chief operating decision maker uses adjusted operating income to assess segment profitability. The chief operating decision maker does not use total assets by segment to make decisions regarding resources; therefore, the total asset disclosure by segment has not been included. Retail Pharmacy USA The Retail Pharmacy USA segment consists of the Walgreens business, which includes the operation of retail drugstores, convenient care clinics and mail and central specialty pharmacy services. Sales for the segment are principally derived from the sale of prescription drugs and a wide assortment of retail products, including health and wellness, beauty and personal care and consumables and general merchandise. Retail Pharmacy International The Retail Pharmacy International segment consists of pharmacy-led health and beauty retail businesses and optical practices. These businesses include Boots branded stores in the United Kingdom, Thailand, Norway, the Republic of Ireland and the Netherlands, Benavides in Mexico and Ahumada in Chile. Sales for the segment are principally derived from the sale of prescription drugs and health and wellness, beauty and personal care and other consumer products. Pharmaceutical Wholesale The Pharmaceutical Wholesale segment consists of the Alliance Healthcare pharmaceutical wholesaling and distribution businesses and an equity method investment in AmerisourceBergen. Wholesale operations are located in the United Kingdom, Germany, France, Turkey, Spain, the Netherlands, Egypt, Norway, Romania, Czech Republic and Lithuania. Sales for the segment are principally derived from wholesaling and distribution of a comprehensive offering of brand-name pharmaceuticals (including specialty pharmaceutical products) and generic pharmaceuticals, health and beauty products, home healthcare supplies and equipment and related services to pharmacies and other healthcare providers. The results of operations for each reportable segment includes procurement benefits and an allocation of corporate-related overhead costs. The Eliminations column contains items not allocable to the reportable segments, as the information is not utilized by the chief operating decision maker to assess segment performance and allocate resources. - 97 - The following table reflects results of operations of the Company's reportable segments (in millions): ##TABLE_START  For the years ending August 31,    Sales:      Retail Pharmacy USA $ 104,532  $ 98,392  $ 87,302 Retail Pharmacy International 11,462  12,281  11,813 Pharmaceutical Wholesale 23,053  23,006  21,188 Eliminations 1 (2,180 )  (2,142 )  (2,089 ) Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. $ 136,866  $ 131,537  $ 118,214 Adjusted Operating income: 2      Retail Pharmacy USA $ 5,255  $ 5,814  $ 5,606 Retail Pharmacy International   Pharmaceutical Wholesale   Eliminations 1   Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. $ 6,942  $ 7,679  $ 7,467 Depreciation and amortization:      Retail Pharmacy USA $ 1,459  $ 1,196  $ 1,090 Retail Pharmacy International   Pharmaceutical Wholesale   Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. $ 2,038  $ 1,770  $ 1,654 Capital expenditures:      Retail Pharmacy USA $ 1,323  $ 1,022  $ Retail Pharmacy International   Pharmaceutical Wholesale   Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. $ 1,702  $ 1,367  $ 1,351 ##TABLE_ENDThe following table reconciles adjusted operating income to operating income (in millions): ##TABLE_START  For the years ending August 31,    Adjusted operating income 2 $ 6,942  $ 7,679  $ 7,467 Acquisition-related amortization and impairment 3 (567 )  (448 )  (332 ) Transformational cost management (477 )     Acquisition-related costs (303 )  (231 )  (474 ) Adjustments to equity earnings in AmerisourceBergen (233 )  (175 )  (187 ) Store optimization (196 )  (100 )   LIFO provision (136 )  (84 )  (166 ) Certain legal and regulatory accruals and settlements 4 (31 )  (284 )   Asset recovery    Hurricane-related costs   (83 )   Cost Transformation     (835 ) Operating income 2 $ 4,998  $ 6,289  $ 5,484 ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START 1  Eliminations relate to intersegment sales between the Pharmaceutical Wholesale and the Retail Pharmacy International segments. ##TABLE_END- 98 - ##TABLE_START 2  The Company adopted new accounting guidance in Accounting Standards Update 2017-07 as of September 1, 2018 (fiscal 2019) on a retrospective basis for the Consolidated Statements of Earnings presentation.

Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the framework in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). As permitted by the SEC, our assessment of internal controls over financial reporting excludes internal control over financial reporting of equity method investees. However, our assessment of internal control over financial reporting with respect to equity method investees did include controls over the recording of amounts related to our investment that are recorded in the Consolidated Financial Statements, including controls over the selection of accounting methods for our investments, the recognition of equity method earnings and losses and the determination, valuation and recording of our investment account balances. Based on our evaluation, management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of August 31, 2019 . Deloitte  Touche LLP, the Companys independent registered public accounting firm, has audited our internal control over financial reporting, as stated in its report which is included herein.  ##TABLE_START /s/ Stefano Pessina  /s/ James Kehoe   Stefano Pessina   James Kehoe   Executive Vice Chairman and Chief Executive Officer   Executive Vice President and Global Chief Financial Officer  ##TABLE_ENDOctober 28, 2019 - 102 - REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM To the Shareholders and the Board of Directors of Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. Opinion on the Financial Statements We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. and subsidiaries (the \"Company\") as of August 31, 2019 and 2018, the related consolidated statements of earnings, comprehensive income, equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended August 31, 2019, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the \"financial statements\"). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of August 31, 2019 and 2018, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended August 31, 2019, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of August 31, 2019, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated October 28, 2019, expressed an unqualified opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting.

We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. Critical Audit Matters The critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate. Goodwill and Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets Impairment Evaluation - Boots Reporting Unit and Boots Indefinite-lived Intangible Assets - Refer to Notes 1 and 6 to the financial statements Critical Audit Matter Description The Companys evaluation of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment involves the comparison of the fair value of each reporting unit or asset to its carrying value. The Company uses the income and the market approaches to estimate the fair value of its reporting units in its goodwill impairment analysis. The income approach requires management to make a number of assumptions for each reporting unit including annual assumptions on future revenue growth, earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) margins and discount rates. The market approach requires management to estimate fair value using comparable marketplace fair value data from within a comparable industry group. The Company primarily uses the multi-period excess earnings model and the relief from royalty model to estimate the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible assets. Changes in assumptions or the selection of companies in the comparable industry group could have a significant impact on the valuation of the reporting units and the amount of a goodwill or indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment charge, if any. - 103 - The Companys goodwill balance was $16.6 billion as of August 31, 2019, of which $2.6 billion was allocated to the Boots Reporting Unit. Managements estimate of the fair value of the Boots Reporting Unit is in excess of its carrying value by approximately 9% and, therefore, no impairment was recognized for the year ended August 31, 2019. The Companys indefinite-lived intangible assets balance was $7.1 billion as of August 31, 2019, of which $6.9 billion represented Boots indefinite-lived intangible assets. The fair value of the Boots indefinite-lived intangible assets is in excess of their carrying value by approximately 3% to approximately 29%, except for the Pharmacy License intangible, for which the Company recorded a $73 million impairment for the year ended August 31, 2019. Management has made significant judgments to estimate the fair value of the Boots Reporting Unit and the Boots indefinite-lived intangible assets. Given the small difference between their fair values and carrying values, performing audit procedures to evaluate the reasonableness of managements estimates and assumptions of future revenue growth, EBITDA margins, the selection of the discount rate, the selection of the royalty rates for the Boots trade name indefinite-lived intangible assets, and the market multiple selected for the Boots Reporting Unit, specifically due to the sensitivity of the Boots Reporting Unit and Boots indefinite-lived intangible assets to changes in the British economy, required a high degree of auditor judgment and an increased extent of effort, including the need to involve our fair value specialists. How the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit Our audit procedures related to the fair value of goodwill for the Boots Reporting Unit and the Boots indefinite-lived intangible assets included the following, among others: ##TABLE_START  We tested the effectiveness of controls over the goodwill and intangible asset impairment analyses, including those over the development of forecasts of future revenues, EBITDA margins, and the selection of royalty rates, market multiples, and discount rates. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  We evaluated managements ability to accurately forecast future revenues and EBITDA margins by comparing actual results to managements historical forecasts. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  We evaluated the reasonableness of managements forecasts of future revenues and EBITDA margins by performing certain procedures, including: ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Comparing the forecasts to internal communications to management and the Board of Directors. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Comparing the forecasts to third-party economic research, including discussions with our economic and industry specialists. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  We performed sensitivity analyses to evaluate the risk of impairment if key assumptions are changed. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  We evaluated, with the assistance of our fair value specialists, the (1) valuation methodology used for the Boots Reporting Unit goodwill and the Boots indefinite-lived intangible assets and (2) the reasonableness of the related discount rates, by performing certain procedures, including: ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Comparing the valuation methodologies used to generally accepted valuation practices for each asset type. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Evaluating the appropriateness of the Companys selection of companies in its industry comparable group for comparability to the Boots Reporting Unit. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Testing the source information underlying the determination of the discount rate and the mathematical accuracy of the calculation. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Developing an independent discount rate and comparing it to the discount rate selected by management . ##TABLE_END Income Taxes - Uncertain Tax Positions - Refer to Notes 1 and 11 to the financial statements Critical Audit Matter Description The Company has a complex legal structure involving numerous domestic and foreign locations with constantly changing tax laws and regulations. The Companys management is required to interpret and apply these tax laws and regulations in determining the amount of its income tax liability and provision. When an uncertain tax position is identified by management, the Company must evaluate whether it is more likely to be sustained than not on the basis of its technical merits. The Company recognizes a benefit for tax positions using the highest cumulative tax benefit that is more likely than not to be realized. The Company establishes a liability for unrecognized tax benefits that do not meet this threshold. The evaluation of each uncertain tax position requires management to apply specialized skill, knowledge, and significant judgment related to the identified position. The Companys liability for unrecognized tax benefits as of August 31, 2019 was $455 million. - 104 - Because of the numerous taxing jurisdictions in which the Company files its tax returns and the complexity of tax laws and regulations, auditing uncertain tax positions and the determination of whether the more likely than not threshold was met requires a high degree of auditor judgment and increased extent of effort, including the involvement of our income tax specialists. How the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit Our audit procedures related to unrecognized tax benefits included the following, among others: ##TABLE_START  We tested the effectiveness of controls over income taxes, including those over identifying uncertain tax positions and measuring liabilities. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  We evaluated, with the assistance of our tax specialists, a selection of underlying tax positions to evaluate the more likely than not principle as it applied to the specific underlying tax position. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  We evaluated, with the assistance of our tax specialists, the Companys unrecognized tax positions by performing the following: ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Obtaining management and third-party opinions or memoranda regarding the analysis of uncertain tax positions and identifying the key judgments and evaluating whether the analysis was consistent with our interpretation of the relevant laws and regulations. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Evaluating the basis for certain intercompany transactions, such as transfer pricing, by comparison to economic studies performed by management and third-party data. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Evaluating the matters raised by tax authorities in former and ongoing tax audits and considering the implications of these matters on open tax years. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Assessing changes and interpretation of applicable tax law. ##TABLE_END /s/ DELOITTE  TOUCHE LLP Chicago, Illinois October 28, 2019  We have served as the Company's auditor since 2002. - 105 - REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM  To the Shareholders and the Board of Directors of Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. Opinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting We have audited the internal control over financial reporting of Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. and subsidiaries (the Company) as of August 31, 2019, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of August 31, 2019, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by COSO. We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended August 31, 2019, of the Company and our report dated October 28, 2019, expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements. Basis for Opinion The Companys management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Managements Report on Internal Control. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Companys internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting A companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. /s/ DELOITTE  TOUCHE LLP Chicago, Illinois October 28, 2019 - 106 - ", "9A": " Item 9A. Controls and procedures Evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures Management conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this Form 10-K. The controls evaluation was conducted under the supervision and with the participation of the Companys management, including its Chief Executive Officer (CEO) and Chief Financial Officer (CFO). Based upon the controls evaluation, our CEO and CFO have concluded that, as of the end of the period covered by this report, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in our Exchange Act reports is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified by the SEC, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to management, including the CEO and CFO, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Report on internal control over financial reporting Managements report on internal control over financial reporting and the report of Deloitte  Touche LLP, the Companys independent registered public accounting firm, related to their assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting are included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K and are incorporated in this Item 9A by reference. Changes in internal control over financial reporting In connection with the evaluation pursuant to Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(d) of the Companys internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f)) by the Companys management, including its CEO and CFO, no changes during the quarter ended August 31, 2019 were identified that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Companys internal control over financial reporting. We are implementing a new enterprise resource planning (ERP) system which affects many of our financial processes. This project is expected to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of certain financial and business transaction processes, as well as the underlying systems environment. The new ERP system will be a significant component of our internal control over financial reporting. Inherent limitations on effectiveness of controls Our management, including the CEO and CFO, do not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent or detect all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the control systems objectives will be met. The design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Further, because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that misstatements due to error or fraud will not occur or that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the Company have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake. Controls can also be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people, or by management override of the controls. The design of any system of controls is based in part on certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. Projections of any evaluation of controls effectiveness to future periods are subject to risks. Over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or deterioration in the degree of compliance with policies or procedures. ", "9B": " Item 9B.
