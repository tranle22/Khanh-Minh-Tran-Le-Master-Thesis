The hours of operation for operating units in the International segment vary by country and by individual markets within countries, depending upon local and national ordinances governing hours of operation. We accept a variety of payment methods including credit cards, debit cards and private-label store credit cards issued by third-party providers.

In addition, relationships with key global suppliers continue to help us leverage our volumes across countries. Seasonal Aspects of Operations.

We utilize a total of 132 distribution facilities located in Argentina, Brazil, Canada, Chile, China, Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Japan, Mexico, Nicaragua, Puerto Rico and the United Kingdom, including two export  consolidation facilities in the United States.

Shipments typically spend less than 24 hours in a crossdock facility, sometimes less than an hour. Sams Club uses a combination of our private truck fleet, as well as common carriers to transport non-perishable merchandise from distribution centers to clubs. We contract with common carriers to transport perishable grocery merchandise from distribution centers to clubs. Other Segment Information Certain financial information relating to our segments is included in our Annual Report to Shareholders under the caption Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and in Note 14 to our Consolidated Financial Statements included therein, which information is incorporated herein by reference. Note 14 includes information regarding our net revenues received from external customers and the total assets of continuing operations we held in the United States and the other countries in which we operate. Portions of our Annual Report to Shareholders are included as an exhibit to this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Employees As of the end of fiscal 2010, the company and its subsidiaries employed approximately 2.1 million employees (associates) worldwide, with approximately 1.4 million associates in the United States and 700,000 associates internationally. Similar to other retailers, the company has a large number of part-time, hourly or non-exempt employees and experiences significant turnover in employees each year. In the United States, the company offers a broad range of company-paid benefits to our associates, including the Walmart Profit Sharing and 401(k) Plan, store discount cards or Sams Club memberships, bonuses based on company performance, matching a portion of purchases in the Associate Stock Purchase Program, and life insurance. The company also offers health-care benefits to eligible full-time and part-time associates. The companys medical plan has no lifetime maximum benefit for most expenses.  In our operations outside the United States, the company provides a variety of associate benefits that vary based on customary local practices and statutory requirements.

RISK FACTORS ##TABLE_END The risks described below could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. These risks are not the only risks that we face. Our business operations could also be affected by additional factors that apply to all companies operating in the United States and globally, as well as other risks that are not presently known to us or that we currently consider to be immaterial to our operations. General economic factors, both domestically and internationally, may adversely affect our financial performance. General economic conditions, globally or in one or more of the markets we serve, may adversely affect our financial performance. In the United States, higher interest rates, higher fuel and other energy costs, weakness in the housing market, inflation, deflation, higher levels of unemployment, decreases in consumer disposable income, unavailability of consumer credit, higher consumer debt levels, fluctuations in currency exchange rates, higher tax rates and other changes in tax laws, other regulatory changes, overall economic slowdown and other economic factors could adversely affect consumer demand for the products and services we sell through our Walmart U.S. segment and Sams Club segment, change the mix of products we sell to one with a lower average gross margin, cause a slowdown in discretionary purchases of goods and result in slower inventory turnover and greater markdowns on inventory. Higher levels of unemployment, inflation, deflation, decreases in consumer disposable income, changes in tax and other laws, higher fuel and other energy costs, weakness in the local housing market, fluctuations in currency exchange rates, currency devaluations and other adverse developments in the economies of the other countries in which we operate may adversely affect consumer demand for our merchandise in those countries, especially those countries in which average incomes are significantly lower than in the United States. These conditions may adversely affect our gross margins, cost of sales, inventory turnover and markdowns or otherwise adversely affect our operations and operating results in our International segment. Higher interest rates, higher fuel and other energy costs, transportation costs, inflation, higher costs of labor, insurance and healthcare, foreign exchange rates fluctuations, higher tax rates and other changes in tax laws, the imposition of measures that create barriers to or increase the costs associated with international trade, changes in other laws and regulations and other economic factors in the United States and other countries in which we have operations can increase our cost of sales and operating, selling, general and administrative expenses, and otherwise adversely affect our domestic and international operations and our operating results. The economic factors that affect our operations, also affect the operations and economic viability of our suppliers from whom we purchase goods, a factor that can result in an increase in the cost to us of the goods we sell to our customers or, in more extreme cases, could result in certain suppliers not producing goods in the volume typically available to us for sale.  We may face impediments to our expansion in the United States, including conversions of discount stores into supercenters, which may adversely affect our financial performance. Our expansion strategy depends upon our ability to execute our retail concepts successfully in new markets within the United States and upon our ability to increase the number of stores in markets in which we currently have operations. Our ability to open additional supercenters, discount stores, Neighborhood Markets and Sams Clubs and to convert existing discount stores into supercenters depends in large measure upon our ability to locate, hire and retain qualified personnel and to acquire new store sites on acceptable terms. Local land use and other regulations restricting the construction of buildings of the type in which we operate our various formats, as well as local community action opposed to the location of specific stores at specific sites and the adoption of certain local laws restricting our operations, may affect our ability to open new stores and clubs, to convert discount stores into supercenters or to relocate or expand existing units in certain cities and states. Increased real estate, construction and development costs could limit our growth opportunities and our ability to convert our discount stores into supercenters. If we are unable to open new supercenters, discount stores, Neighborhood Markets or Sams Clubs or continue to convert discount stores into supercenters, our financial performance, such as net sales and operating income growth, could be adversely affected. In addition, if consumers in the markets into which we expand are not receptive to our retail concepts or are otherwise not receptive to our presence in a market, our financial performance could be adversely affected. Impediments to the expansion of our International operations could adversely affect our financial performance. Our business strategy for our International segment includes expansion by selective acquisitions and strategic alliances that add new stores and markets to our existing International business, as well as opening new units in the countries in which we have existing operations. In the countries in which we have existing operations, new units may be opened in the formats already existing in those countries or may be opened in newly introduced formats, such as supercenters or Sams Clubs, not previously operated in those markets. As in the United States, our ability to open new stores or to expand or relocate existing stores in a market served by our International segment depends in large measure upon our ability to locate, hire and retain qualified personnel and our ability to acquire new store sites on acceptable terms. Local laws can affect our ability to acquire attractive pre-existing buildings in which to locate units or sites on which to build new units or to expand existing units. In addition, access to local suppliers of certain types of goods may limit our ability to add new units or to expand product selections in existing units in certain markets. Moreover, cultural differences in some markets into which we expand or into which we introduce new retail concepts may result in the consumers in those markets not being as receptive to our retail concepts as we anticipate those consumers will be and may make an effective response to such issues more difficult to achieve. If we do not effectively execute our expansion plans for our International segment, our financial performance could be adversely affected. We may be unable to continue to identify suitable acquisition candidates at acceptable prices and may not be successful in completing the acquisition of any such candidate identified. Although we ultimately believe we will be able to successfully integrate any newly acquired operations into our existing operations, no certainty exists that future acquisitions or alliances will be successfully integrated into our operations or can be successfully integrated in a reasonable time. Our failure to identify appropriate candidates for acquisition or alliance or to integrate effectively future acquisitions and alliances into our existing operations could adversely affect the growth of our International segment and our future financial performance. Failure to attract and retain qualified associates, changes in laws and other labor issues could adversely affect our financial performance. Our ability to continue to expand our operations in the United States and abroad depends on our ability to attract and retain a large and growing number of qualified associates. Our ability to meet our labor needs, including our ability to find qualified personnel to fill positions that become vacant at our existing stores, clubs and distribution centers, while controlling our associate wage and related labor costs, is generally subject to numerous external factors, including the availability of a sufficient number of qualified persons in the work force of the markets in which we are located, unemployment levels within those markets, prevailing wage rates, changing demographics, health and other insurance costs and adoption of new or revised employment and labor laws and regulations. If we are unable to locate, to attract or to retain qualified personnel, if our costs of labor or related costs increase significantly or if new or revised labor laws, rules or regulations are adopted, our financial performance could be affected adversely. We face strong competition from other retailers and wholesale club operators, which could adversely affect our financial performance. The retail business is highly competitive. Each of our business segments competes for customers, employees, store sites, products and services and in other important aspects of its business with many other local, regional and national retailers, both in the United States and in the foreign countries in which we have operations. Our Walmart U.S. segment competes with  retailers operating discount, department, drug, variety and specialty stores, supermarkets, supercenter-type stores and hypermarts, as well as internet-based retailers and catalog businesses. Our Sams Club segment competes with other wholesale club operators, as well as discount retailers, retail and wholesale grocers and general merchandise wholesalers and distributors, as well as internet-based retailers, wholesalers and catalog businesses. Internationally, we compete with retailers who operate department, drug, variety and specialty stores, supermarkets, supercenter-type stores, hypermarts, wholesale clubs, internet-based retailers and catalog businesses. Such retailers and wholesale club operators compete in a variety of ways, including merchandise selection and availability, services offered to customers, location, store hours, in-store amenities and price. Our ability to offer value and service to our customers through various programs, including EDLP, Rollbacks and Store of the Community, have allowed us to compete successfully against our competitors in most instances. Where necessary to compete effectively with competitors who price merchandise at points lower than the prices we set under our EDLP philosophy, we will lower our prices on goods for sale. Our ability to respond effectively to competitive pressures and changes in the retail markets could adversely affect our financial performance. See Item 1. Business above for additional discussion of our competitive situation in our various operating segments. Although the retail industry as a whole is highly fragmented, certain segments of the retail industry are currently undergoing some consolidation, which could result in increased competition and significantly alter the dynamics of the retail marketplace. Such consolidation may result in competitors with greatly improved financial resources, improved access to merchandise, greater market penetration than they previously enjoyed and other improvements in their competitive positions. Such business combinations could result in the provision of a wider variety of products and services at competitive prices by such consolidated companies, which could adversely affect our financial performance. Risks associated with the suppliers from whom our products are sourced and the safety of those products could adversely affect our financial performance. The products we sell are sourced from a wide variety of domestic and international suppliers. Global sourcing of many of the products we sell is an important factor in our financial performance. All of our suppliers must comply with applicable laws, including labor and environmental laws, and otherwise be certified as meeting our required supplier standards of conduct. Our ability to find qualified suppliers who meet our standards, and to access products in a timely and efficient manner is a significant challenge, especially with respect to suppliers located and goods sourced outside the United States. Political and economic instability in the countries in which foreign suppliers are located, the financial instability of suppliers, suppliers failure to meet our supplier standards, labor problems experienced by our suppliers, the availability of raw materials to suppliers, merchandise quality issues, currency exchange rates, transport availability and cost, transport security, inflation, and other factors relating to the suppliers and the countries in which they are located are beyond our control. In addition, the United States foreign trade policies, tariffs and other impositions on imported goods, trade sanctions imposed on certain countries, the limitation on the importation of certain types of goods or of goods containing certain materials from other countries and other factors relating to foreign trade are beyond our control. These and other factors affecting our suppliers and our access to products could adversely affect our financial performance. Our customers count on us to provide them with safe products. Concerns regarding the safety of food and non-food products that we source from our suppliers and then sell could cause shoppers to avoid purchasing certain products from us, or to seek alternative sources of supply for all of their food and non-food needs, even if the basis for the concern is outside of our control. Any lost confidence on the part of our customers would be difficult and costly to reestablish. As such, any issue regarding the safety of any food and non-food items we sell, regardless of the cause, could adversely affect our financial performance. Our International operations subject us to risks associated with the legislative, judicial, accounting, regulatory, political and economic risks and conditions specific to the countries or regions in which we operate, which could adversely affect our financial performance. We currently conduct operations in Argentina, Brazil, Canada, Chile, Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Japan, Mexico, Nicaragua, Puerto Rico, and the United Kingdom, as well as through joint venture agreements in China and India and our other controlled subsidiaries in China. During fiscal 2010, our International operations generated 24.7% of our net sales. As a result of our expansion activities in foreign countries, we expect that our International operations could account for a larger portion of our net sales in future years. Our future operating results in these countries or in other countries or regions throughout the world could be negatively affected by a variety of factors, most of which are beyond our control. These factors include political conditions, including political instability, economic conditions, legal and regulatory constraints, trade policies, both of the United States and of the other countries in which we operate, currency regulations, and other matters in any of the countries or regions in which we operate, now or in the future. Foreign currency exchange rates and fluctuations may have an impact on our future costs or on future cash flows from our International operations, and could adversely affect our financial performance.  Moreover, the economies of some of the countries in which we have operations have in the past suffered from high rates of inflation and currency devaluations, which, if they occurred again, could adversely affect our financial performance. Other factors which may impact our International operations include foreign trade, monetary and fiscal policies both of the United States and of other countries, laws, regulations and other activities of foreign governments, agencies and similar organizations, and risks associated with having numerous facilities located in countries which have historically been less stable than the United States. Additional risks inherent in our International operations generally include, among others, the costs and difficulties of managing international operations, adverse tax consequences and greater difficulty in enforcing intellectual property rights in countries other than the United States. The various risks inherent in doing business in the United States generally also exist when doing business outside of the United States, and may be exaggerated by the difficulty of doing business in numerous sovereign jurisdictions due to differences in culture, laws and regulations. Natural disasters and geo-political events could adversely affect our financial performance. The occurrence of one or more natural disasters, such as hurricanes, floods and earthquakes, other weather conditions, whether as a result of climate change or otherwise, such as major winter storms, droughts and tornados, and geo-political events, such as civil unrest in a country in which we operate or in which our suppliers are located or terrorist attacks, both internationally and domestically, could adversely affect our operations and financial performance. Such events could result in physical damage to one or more of our properties, the closure of one or more stores, clubs and distribution centers, the lack of an adequate work force in a market, the temporary or long-term disruption in the supply of products from some local and overseas suppliers, the disruption in the transport of goods from overseas, the disruption or delay in the delivery of goods to our distribution centers or stores within a country in which we are operating, the reduction in the availability of products in our stores, the disruption of utility services to our stores and our facilities, and disruption in our communications with our stores. These factors could otherwise disrupt and adversely affect our operations and financial performance. The significant property damage experienced by the company and others resulting from the hurricanes in fiscal year 2006 resulted in substantial increases in property insurance premiums and limitations in coverage offered by the property insurance markets to us and others. The insurance coverage offered to the company for named windstorms, such as hurricanes and tropical storms, was substantially more limited and carried higher premiums than the coverage previously available to us. As a result, the company has chosen to be primarily self-insured for losses that may result from named windstorms. We are subject to certain legal proceedings that may adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. We are involved in a number of legal proceedings, which include consumer, employment, tort and other litigation. Certain of these lawsuits, if decided adversely to us or settled by us, may result in liability material to our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. We are currently a defendant in numerous cases containing class-action allegations in which the plaintiffs have brought claims under federal and state wage and hour laws. In addition, we are a defendant in Dukes v. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. , a class-action lawsuit brought on behalf of all past and present female employees in all of our retail stores and wholesale clubs in the United States. The class as certified in Dukes currently includes present and former female associates. The plaintiffs in this case allege that we have engaged in a pattern and practice of discriminating against women in promotions, pay, training and job assignments and seek, among other things, injunctive relief, front pay, back pay, punitive damages and attorneys fees. On June 4, 2004, the U.S. district court hearing this case issued an order granting in part and denying in part the plaintiffs motion for class certification, which we have appealed. On February 6, 2007, a divided three-judge panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit upheld the district courts ruling. On February 20, 2007, the company filed a petition asking that the decision be reconsidered by a larger panel of the Court of Appeals. On November 11, 2007, the three-judge panel withdrew its opinion of February 6, 2007, and issued a revised opinion. As a result, the companys Petition for Rehearing En Banc was denied as moot. The company filed a new Petition for Rehearing En Banc on January 8, 2008. On February 13, 2009, the court of appeals issued an Order granting the Petition. The court of appeals heard oral argument on the Petition on March 24, 2009. We discuss these cases and other litigation to which we are party in greater detail below under the caption Item 3. Legal Proceedings and in Note 11 to our Consolidated Financial Statements, which are part of our Annual Report to Shareholders which are incorporated by reference in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and are included as an exhibit to this Annual Report on Form 10-K. If we do not maintain the security of customer-related information, we could damage our reputation with customers, incur substantial additional costs and become subject to litigation. As do most retailers, we receive certain personal information about our customers. In addition, our online operations at www.walmart.com and www.samsclub.com depend upon the secure transmission of confidential information over public networks, including information permitting cashless payments. A compromise of our security systems that results in customer personal information being obtained by unauthorized persons could adversely affect our reputation with our customers and others, as well as our operations, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity, and could result in  litigation against us or the imposition of penalties. In addition, a security breach could require that we expend significant additional resources related to our information security systems and could result in a disruption of our operations, particularly our online sales operations. We rely extensively on computer systems to process transactions, summarize results and manage our business. Disruptions in both our primary and secondary (back-up) systems could harm our ability to run our business. Implementation of a new financial system in fiscal year 2011, if not properly completed, could make financial information unavailable on a timely basis and delay our financial reporting. Although we have independent, redundant and physically separate primary and secondary computer systems, given the number of individual transactions we have each year, it is critical that we maintain uninterrupted operation of our business critical computer systems. Our computer systems, including our back-up systems, are subject to damage or interruption from power outages, computer and telecommunications failures, computer viruses, security breaches, catastrophic events such as fires, tornadoes and hurricanes, and usage errors by our employees. If our computer systems and our back-up systems are damaged or cease to function properly, we may have to make a significant investment to fix or replace them, and we may suffer interruptions in our operations in the interim. Any material interruption in both of our computer systems and back-up systems may have a material adverse effect on our business or results of operations. In addition, we are pursuing complex initiatives to transform our information technology processes and systems, which will include, for many of our computer systems, establishing common processes across our lines of business. The risk of system disruption is increased when significant system changes are undertaken, although we believe that our change management process will mitigate this risk. If we fail to integrate our computer systems and processes we may fail to realize the cost savings anticipated to be derived from these initiatives. In the second quarter of fiscal 2011, we expect to implement a new financial system in our U.S., Canada and Puerto Rico operations. The implementation of this new financial system relates to the largest portion of our business and will be a significant component of our internal controls over financial reporting. If the new financial system does not function properly upon implementation, we may be unable to produce information as needed to manage our business most efficiently or to accumulate and report financial information on a timely basis. We may not timely identify or effectively respond to consumer trends, which could negatively affect our relationship with our customers, the demand for our products and services, and our market share. It is difficult to predict consistently and successfully the products and services our customers will demand. The success of our business depends in part on our ability to identify and respond to evolving trends in demographics and consumer preferences. Failure to timely identify or effectively respond to changing consumer tastes, preferences and spending patterns could negatively affect our relationship with our customers, the demand for our products and services and our market share. ##TABLE_START ", "1B": " ITEM 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS ##TABLE_END Not applicable. ##TABLE_START ", "2": " ITEM 2. PROPERTIES ##TABLE_END The number of discount stores, supercenters, Neighborhood Markets and Sams Clubs located in each state in the United States and the number of units located in each of the countries in which we operate are disclosed as of fiscal year-end January 31, 2010 in our Annual Report to Shareholders under the caption Fiscal 2010 End-of-Year Store Count and are incorporated herein by reference. Portions of such Annual Report to Shareholders are included as an exhibit to this Annual Report on Form 10-K. United States. As of January 31, 2010, in the United States, we owned 3,214 of the buildings in which discount stores, supercenters and Neighborhood Markets operated and 483 of the buildings in which our Sams Clubs operated. Land on which our stores are located is either owned or leased by the company. In the United States, we lease the remaining buildings in which our stores and clubs operate from either commercial property developers pursuant to capital or operating lease arrangements or from local governmental entities in connection with industrial revenue bond financing arrangements. All store leases provide for annual rentals, some of which escalate during the original lease term. In some cases, the leases provide for additional rent based on sales volume. Substantially all of the companys store and club leases have renewal options, some of which include escalation clauses causing an increase in rents. We use independent contractors to construct our buildings.  Our 120 Walmart U.S. and 26 Sams Club distribution centers are located strategically throughout the continental United States. Of these 146 distribution facilities, we owned and operated 113 distribution facilities and third parties owned and operated the remaining 33 distribution facilities. We own office facilities in Bentonville, Arkansas that serve as our home office and lease office facilities throughout the United States for our walmart.com operations and field management. International. We operate our International segment stores and restaurants in a combination of owned and leased properties in each country in which our International segment operates. As of the end of fiscal 2010, we owned 33 properties in Argentina, 161 properties in Brazil, 117 properties in Canada, 125 properties in Chile, 1 property in China, 69 properties in Costa Rica, 9 properties in El Salvador, 14 properties in Guatemala, 7 properties in Honduras, 52 properties in Japan, 530 properties in Mexico, 25 properties in Nicaragua, 11 properties in Puerto Rico and 239 properties in the United Kingdom. The remaining operating units in each such country are leased on terms that vary from property to property. We utilize both owned and leased properties for office facilities in each country in which we are conducting business. As of the end of fiscal 2010, our International operations are supported by 132 distribution facilities. Of these 132 distribution facilities, we owned and operated 34 and leased and operated 37. Third parties owned and operated the remaining 61 distribution facilities.

II. ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS: Item 103 of SEC Regulation S-K requires disclosure of certain environmental matters. The following matters are disclosed in accordance with that requirement: The District Attorney for Solano County, California, has alleged that the companys store in Vacaville, California, failed to comply with certain California statutes regulating hazardous waste and hazardous materials handling practices. Specifically, the County is alleging that the company improperly disposed of a limited amount of damaged or returned product containing dry granular fertilizer and pesticides on or about April 3, 2002. The parties are currently negotiating toward a resolution of this matter. While management cannot predict the ultimate outcome of this matter, management does not believe the outcome will have a material effect on the companys financial condition or results of operations. The District Attorney for Orange County, California, has alleged that the companys store in Foothill Ranch, California, failed to comply with certain California statutes regulating hazardous waste and hazardous materials handling practices. Specifically, the County is alleging that the company improperly disposed of a limited amount of damaged product  containing dry granular pesticide on or about January 24, 2005. The parties are currently negotiating toward a resolution of this matter. While management cannot predict the ultimate outcome of this matter, management does not believe the outcome will have a material effect on the companys financial condition or results of operations. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (the EPA) approached a grocery industry group to resolve issues relating to refrigerant-handling practices and to reduce the use of ozone-depleting refrigerants in refrigeration equipment. The company then approached the EPA independently to address these issues, and proposed a plan for removing ozone-depleting refrigerants from certain types of refrigeration equipment. The parties are currently negotiating a resolution of this matter. While management cannot predict the ultimate outcome of this matter, management does not believe the outcome will have a material effect on the companys financial condition or results of operations. In January 2007, Wal-Mart Puerto Rico, Inc. became aware that the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (the USACE) was concerned about alleged violations of a permit issued by that agency in 2003, for the fill of 0.23 acres of a creek and its contiguous wetlands during the construction of the Wal-Mart Store in Caguas, Puerto Rico. On January 19, 2007, Wal-Mart Puerto Rico responded to these issues in writing. On January 25, 2007, the USACE issued a formal Notice of Non-Compliance to Wal-Mart Puerto Rico regarding this matter. Wal-Mart Puerto Rico filed a formal response and is currently implementing mitigation measures and working with the USACE to resolve the matter. While management cannot predict the ultimate outcome of this matter, management does not believe the outcome will have a material effect on the companys financial condition or results of operations. On November 8, 2005, the company received a grand jury subpoena from the United States Attorneys Office for the Central District of California, seeking documents and information relating to the companys receipt, transportation, handling, identification, recycling, treatment, storage and disposal of certain merchandise that constitutes hazardous materials or hazardous waste. The company has been informed by the U.S. Attorneys Office for the Central District of California that it is a target of a criminal investigation into potential violations of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA), the Clean Water Act and the Hazardous Materials Transportation Statute. This U.S. Attorneys Office contends, among other things, that the use of company trucks to transport certain returned merchandise from the companys stores to its return centers is prohibited by RCRA because those materials may be considered hazardous waste. The government alleges that, to comply with RCRA, the company must ship from the store certain materials as hazardous waste directly to a certified disposal facility using a certified hazardous waste carrier. The company contends that the practice of transporting returned merchandise to its return centers for subsequent disposition, including disposal by certified facilities, is compliant with applicable laws and regulations. While management cannot predict the ultimate outcome of this matter, management does not believe the outcome will have a material effect on the companys financial condition or results of operations. Additionally, the U.S. Attorneys Office in the Northern District of California has initiated its own investigation regarding the companys handling of hazardous materials and hazardous waste and the company has received administrative document requests from the California Department of Toxic Substances Control requesting documents and information with respect to two of the companys distribution facilities. Further, the company also received a subpoena from the Los Angeles County District Attorneys Office for documents and administrative interrogatories requesting information, among other things, regarding the companys handling of materials and hazardous waste. California state and local government authorities have also initiated investigations into these matters. The company is cooperating fully with the respective authorities. While management cannot predict the ultimate outcome of this matter, management does not believe the outcome will have a material effect on the companys financial condition or results of operations. On March 28, 2008, the company received a Notice of Violation from the Missouri Department of Natural Resources (the Department) alleging various violations of Missouri hazardous waste laws and regulations in connection with the activities of a third-party contractor with whom the company had contracted for recycling services. The Department alleges that the company provided certain items to the contractor for recycling that should have been managed as hazardous waste. The EPA has inspected the contractors facilities, and both the EPA and the U.S. Attorneys Office for the Western District of Missouri are conducting investigations.

At March 26, 2010, the latest practicable date, there were 292,983 common stock shareholders of record. From time to time, we have repurchased shares of our common stock under a $15.0 billion share repurchase program authorized by our Board of Directors on June 4, 2009 and announced on June 5, 2009, which replaced and terminated a $15.0 billion share repurchase program approved by our Board of Directors on May 31, 2007 and announced on June 1, 2007. As was the case with the replaced share repurchase program, the new program has no expiration date or other restrictions limiting the period over which we can make our share repurchases, and will expire only when and if we have repurchased $15.0 billion of our shares under the program or we terminate or replace the program. Any repurchased shares are constructively retired and returned to unissued status. We consider several factors in determining when to execute the share repurchases, including among other things, our current cash needs, our capacity for leverage, our cost of borrowings and the market price of our common stock.

CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES ##TABLE_END Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures We maintain a system of disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to provide reasonable assurance that information, which is required to be timely disclosed, is accumulated and communicated to management in a timely fashion. In designing and evaluating such controls and procedures, we recognize that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. Our management is necessarily required to use judgment in evaluating controls and procedures. Also, we may have investments in certain unconsolidated entities. Since we do not control or manage those entities, our controls and procedures with respect to those entities are substantially more limited than those we maintain with respect to our consolidated subsidiaries. In the ordinary course of business, we review our system of internal control over financial reporting and make changes to our systems and processes to improve such controls and increase efficiency, while ensuring that we maintain an effective internal control environment. Changes may include such activities as implementing new, more efficient systems and automating manual processes. In the second quarter of fiscal 2010, we began implementing a new financial system in stages. As part of the first stage, we implemented this financial system in ASDA, our United Kingdom subsidiary. The second stage, implementing the financial system in the U.S. and our subsidiaries in Canada and Puerto Rico, which is the largest portion of our business, is planned to occur in the second quarter of fiscal 2011. This new financial system is a significant component of our internal control over financial reporting. We will continue to implement our new financial system in stages, and each implementation may become a significant component of our internal control over financial reporting. An evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures was performed as of the end of the period covered by this report. This evaluation was performed under the supervision and with the participation of management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer. Based upon that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are effective to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by the company in the reports that it files or submits under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, is accumulated and communicated to management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure and are effective to provide reasonable assurance that such information is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified by the SECs rules and forms.

Balances for fiscal years 2008 and 2007 are stated as of January 31 of the corresponding fiscal year.

Generally, retail centers range in size from 2,000 square feet to 250,000 square feet. Our wholesale stores generally range in size from 40,000 square feet to 150,000 square feet. Other, representing restaurants in Chile, Japan and Mexico, range in size from under 1,000 square feet to 10,000 square feet.

The merchandising strategy for the Walmart International segment is similar to that of our operations in the United States in terms of the breadth and scope of merchandise offered for sale. While brand name merchandise accounts for a majority of sales, numerous store brands not offered for sale in the U.S. stores and clubs have been developed to serve customers in the different markets in which the Walmart International segment operates. In addition, steps have been taken to develop relationships with local suppliers in each country to ensure reliable sources of quality merchandise.  Operations. The hours of operation for operating units in the Walmart International segment vary by country and by individual markets within countries, depending upon local and national ordinances governing hours of operation. We accept a variety of payment methods including credit cards, debit cards and private-label store credit cards issued by third-party providers and in Chile, Canada and Mexico, credit cards issued by our subsidiaries. Other consumer finance programs exist in certain markets to facilitate the purchase of goods by the customer. Across the Walmart International segment, we are leveraging best practices, lessons from multiple store formats and global sourcing practices. In addition, relationships with key global suppliers continue to help us leverage our volumes across countries. Seasonal Aspects of Operations. The Walmart International segments business is seasonal to a certain extent. Historically, the highest sales volume and segment operating income occur in our fiscal quarter ending January 31 and the lowest sales volume and segment operating income occur in the fiscal quarter ending April 30. The seasonality of the business varies by country due to different national and religious holidays, festivals and customs, as well as different climatic conditions. Competition. The Walmart International segment competes with a variety of local, national and international chains in the supermarket, discount, department, drug, variety and specialty stores, supercenter-type stores, hypermarts, wholesale clubs, internet-based retailers and catalog businesses in each of the countries in which we operate. We also operate local, national and international restaurant chains in Mexico, and consumer finance operations in Canada, Chile and Mexico. Our ability to offer our customers low prices on quality merchandise that offers exceptional value in the Walmart International segment determines, to a large extent, our competitive position in the countries in which Walmart International operates. In our international units, our ability to operate the food departments effectively has a major impact on the segments competitive position in the markets where we operate. Distribution. We utilize a total of 134 distribution facilities located in Argentina, Brazil, Canada, Chile, China, Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Japan, Mexico, Nicaragua and the United Kingdom, including two export consolidation facilities in the United States. Through these facilities, we process and distribute both imported and domestic products to the operating units of the Walmart International segment. During fiscal 2011, approximately 77% of the Walmart International segments purchases flowed through these distribution facilities. Suppliers ship the balance of the Walmart International segments purchases directly to our stores in the various countries in which we operate. Of these 134 distribution facilities, we owned and operated 34 and leased and operated 38. Third parties owned and operated the remaining 62 distribution facilities. Sams Club Segment The Sams Club segment had net sales of $49.5 billion, $47.8 billion and $48.0 billion for the fiscal years ended January 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. During the most recent fiscal year, no single club location accounted for as much as 1% of total Company net sales. General. As a membership club warehouse, we operate Sams Clubs in 48 states and Puerto Rico. Facility sizes for Sams Clubs generally range between 71,000 and 190,000 square feet, with an average size of approximately 133,000 square feet. Sams Club also provides its members with a broad assortment of merchandise and services online at www.samsclub.com .

Operating hours for Sams Clubs are Monday through Friday from 10:00 a.m. to 8:30 p.m., Saturday from 9:00 a.m. to 8:30 p.m. and Sunday from 10:00 a.m. to 6:00 p.m. Additionally, all club locations offer a Gold Key program that permits Business Members and Plus Members to shop before the regular operating hours Monday through Saturday, starting at 7:00 a.m. Sams Clubs are membership-only operations. A variety of payment methods are accepted at our clubs, including debit cards, certain types of credit cards, and private label and co-branded Discover credit cards issued by a third-party provider. In addition, our pharmacy and optical departments accept payments for products and services through our members health benefit plans. Members include both business owners and individual consumers. Individual consumers are referred to as Advantage Members. The annual membership fee for an individual Advantage Member is $40 (plus taxes, if applicable) for the primary membership card, with a spouse/household card available at no additional cost. The annual membership fee for Business Members is $35 (plus taxes, if applicable) for the primary membership card, with a spouse/household card available at no additional cost. In addition, Business Members can add up to eight business associates to their business account for $35 (plus taxes, if applicable) each. Sams Club Plus is a premium membership program that offers additional benefits and services to both Business and Advantage Club Members. The annual fee for a Primary Plus Member (Business or Advantage) is $100 (plus taxes, if applicable). In addition, Business Plus Primary Members can add up to sixteen business associates to their business membership for $35 (plus taxes, if applicable) each. Seasonal Aspects of Operations. The Sams Club segments business is seasonal to a certain extent due to different calendar events, national and religious holidays, as well as different climatic conditions. Historically, its highest sales volume and segment operating income occur in the fiscal quarter ending January 31, which includes the holiday season, and the lowest sales volume and segment operating income occur during the fiscal quarter ending April 30.  Competition. Sams Club competes with other warehouse clubs, as well as with discount retailers, retail and wholesale grocers, general merchandise wholesalers and distributors, gasoline stations, internet-based retailers and catalog businesses. Sams Club competes with other retailers and warehouse clubs for desirable new club sites. Our ability to offer low prices and quality merchandise and food to meet the needs of our members largely determines our competitive position in the warehouse club industry. Distribution. During fiscal 2011, approximately 63% of the Sams Club segments non-fuel purchases were shipped from the Sams Club segments dedicated distribution facilities and some of the Walmart U.S. segments distribution centers for certain items. Suppliers shipped the balance of the Sams Club segments purchases directly to Sams Club locations. As of January 31, 2011, our Sams Club segment operations were supported by 25 distribution facilities located strategically throughout the continental United States. Of these 25 distribution facilities, we owned and operated 8. Third parties owned and operated the remaining 17 distribution facilities. The principal focus of our Sams Clubs distribution operations is on cross-docking merchandise, while stored inventory is minimized. Cross-docking is a distribution process under which shipments are directly transferred from inbound to outbound trailers. Shipments typically spend less than 24 hours in a cross-dock facility, sometimes less than an hour. Sams Club uses a combination of our private truck fleet, as well as common carriers to transport non-perishable merchandise from distribution centers to clubs. We contract with common carriers to transport perishable grocery merchandise from distribution centers to clubs. Other Segment Information Certain financial information relating to our segments is included in our Annual Report to Shareholders for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2011 (the Annual Report to Shareholders) under the caption Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and in Note 16 to our Consolidated Financial Statements included therein, which information is incorporated herein by reference.

Employees As of the end of fiscal 2011, the Company and its subsidiaries employed approximately 2.1 million employees (associates) worldwide, with approximately 1.4 million associates in the United States and 0.7 million associates internationally. Similar to other retailers, the Company has a large number of part-time, hourly or non-exempt employees and experiences significant turnover in employees each year. The Company maintains separate Profit Sharing and 401(k) Plans for associates in the United States and Puerto Rico. Associates generally become participants following one year of employment. Through fiscal 2011, the Profit Sharing component of the plan was entirely funded by the Company and the Company made an additional contribution to the associates 401(k) component of the plan. In addition to the Companys contributions, associates could elect to contribute a percentage of their earnings to the 401(k) component of the plan. Beginning in fiscal 2012, the Company will offer a safe harbor 401(k) plan to all eligible United States associates. The Company will match 100% of participant contributions up to 6% of annual eligible earnings. The Company will offer the same matching contribution to all eligible Puerto Rico associates. The matching contributions will immediately vest at 100% for each associate. Participants can contribute up to 50% of their pretax earnings, but not more than the statutory limits. Participants age 50 or older may defer additional earnings in catch-up contributions up to the maximum statutory limits.

RISK FACTORS ##TABLE_END The risks described below could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. These risks are not the only risks that we face. Our business operations could also be affected by additional factors that apply to all companies operating in the United States and globally, as well as other risks that are not presently known to us or that we currently consider to be immaterial to our operations. General economic factors, both domestically and internationally, may adversely affect our financial performance. General economic conditions, globally or in one or more of the markets we serve, may adversely affect our financial performance. In the United States, higher interest rates, higher fuel and other energy costs, weakness in the housing market, inflation, deflation, higher levels of unemployment, decreases in consumer disposable income, unavailability of consumer credit, higher consumer debt levels, fluctuations in currency exchange rates, higher tax rates and other changes in tax laws, other regulatory changes, overall economic slowdown and other economic factors could adversely affect consumer demand for the products and services we sell through our Walmart U.S. segment and Sams Club segment, change the mix of products we sell to one with a lower average gross margin, cause a slowdown in discretionary purchases of goods and result in slower inventory turnover and greater markdowns on inventory. Higher levels of unemployment, inflation, deflation, decreases in consumer disposable income, changes in tax and other laws, higher fuel and other energy costs, weakness in the local housing market, fluctuations in currency exchange rates, currency devaluations and other adverse developments in the economies of the other countries in which we operate may adversely affect consumer demand for our merchandise in those countries, especially those countries in which average incomes are significantly lower than in the United States. These conditions may adversely affect our gross margins, cost of sales, inventory turnover and markdowns or otherwise adversely affect our operations and operating results in our Walmart International segment.  Higher interest rates, higher fuel and other energy costs, transportation costs, inflation, higher costs of labor, insurance and healthcare, foreign exchange rates fluctuations, higher tax rates and other changes in tax laws, the imposition of measures that create barriers to or increase the costs associated with international trade, changes in other laws and regulations and other economic factors in the United States and other countries in which we have operations can increase our cost of sales and operating, selling, general and administrative expenses, and otherwise adversely affect our domestic and international operations and our operating results. The economic factors that affect our operations also affect the operations and economic viability of our suppliers from whom we purchase goods, a factor that can result in an increase in the cost to us of the goods we sell to our customers or, in more extreme cases, could result in certain suppliers not producing goods in the volume typically available to us for sale. We may face impediments to our expansion in the United States, including conversions of discount stores into supercenters and opening other store formats, which may adversely affect our financial performance. Our expansion strategy depends upon our ability to execute our retail concepts successfully in new markets within the United States and upon our ability to increase the number of stores in markets in which we currently have operations. Our ability to open additional supercenters, discount stores, Neighborhood Markets, other store formats, and Sams Clubs and to convert existing discount stores into supercenters depends in large measure upon our ability to locate, hire and retain qualified personnel and to acquire new store sites on acceptable terms. Local land use and other regulations restricting the construction of buildings of the type in which we operate our various formats, as well as local community action opposed to the location of specific stores at specific sites and the adoption of certain local laws restricting our operations, may affect our ability to open new stores and clubs, to convert discount stores into supercenters or to relocate or expand existing units in certain cities and states. Increased real estate, construction and development costs could limit our growth opportunities and our ability to convert our discount stores into supercenters. If we are unable to open new supercenters, discount stores, Neighborhood Markets, other small formats or Sams Clubs or continue to convert discount stores into supercenters, our financial performance, such as net sales and operating income growth, could be adversely affected. In addition, if consumers in the markets into which we expand are not receptive to our retail concepts or are otherwise not receptive to our presence in a market, our financial performance could be adversely affected. Impediments to the expansion of our Walmart International operations could adversely affect our financial performance. Our business strategy for our Walmart International segment includes expansion by selective acquisitions and strategic alliances that add new stores and markets to our existing Walmart International business, as well as opening new units in the countries in which we have existing operations. In the countries in which we have existing operations, new units may be opened in the formats already existing in those countries or may be opened in newly introduced formats, such as supercenters or Sams Clubs, not previously operated in those markets. As in the United States, our ability to open new stores or to expand or relocate existing stores in a market served by our Walmart International segment depends in large measure upon our ability to locate, hire and retain qualified personnel and our ability to acquire new store sites on acceptable terms. Local laws can affect our ability to acquire attractive pre-existing buildings in which to locate units or sites on which to build new units or to expand existing units. In addition, access to local suppliers of certain types of goods may limit our ability to add new units or to expand product selections in existing units in certain markets. Moreover, cultural differences in some markets into which we expand or into which we introduce new retail concepts may result in the consumers in those markets not being as receptive to our retail concepts as we anticipate those consumers will be and may make an effective response to such issues more difficult to achieve. If we do not effectively execute our expansion plans for our Walmart International segment, our financial performance could be adversely affected. We may be unable to continue to identify suitable acquisition candidates at acceptable prices and may not be successful in completing the acquisition of any such candidate identified. Although we ultimately believe we will be able to successfully integrate any newly acquired operations into our existing operations, no certainty exists that future acquisitions or alliances will be successfully integrated into our operations or can be successfully integrated in a reasonable time. Our failure to identify appropriate candidates for acquisition or alliance or to integrate effectively future acquisitions and alliances into our existing operations could adversely affect the growth of our Walmart International segment and our future financial performance.  Failure to attract and retain qualified associates, changes in laws and other labor issues could adversely affect our financial performance. Our ability to continue to expand our operations in the United States and abroad depends on our ability to attract and retain a large and growing number of qualified associates. Our ability to meet our labor needs, including our ability to find qualified personnel to fill positions that become vacant at our existing stores, clubs and distribution centers, while controlling our associate wage and related labor costs, is generally subject to numerous external factors, including the availability of a sufficient number of qualified persons in the work force of the markets in which we are located, unemployment levels within those markets, prevailing wage rates, changing demographics, health and other insurance costs and adoption of new or revised employment and labor laws and regulations. If we are unable to locate, to attract or to retain qualified personnel, if our costs of labor or related costs increase significantly or if new or revised labor laws, rules or regulations are adopted, our financial performance could be affected adversely. We face strong competition from other retailers and wholesale club operators, which could adversely affect our financial performance. The retail business is highly competitive. Each of our business segments competes for customers, employees, store sites, products and services and in other important aspects of its business with many other local, regional and national retailers, both in the United States and in the foreign countries in which we have operations. Our Walmart U.S. segment competes with retailers operating discount, department, drug, variety and specialty stores, supermarkets, supercenter-type stores and hypermarts, as well as internet-based retailers and catalog businesses. Our Sams Club segment competes with other wholesale club operators, as well as discount retailers, retail and wholesale grocers and general merchandise wholesalers and distributors, gasoline stations, as well as internet-based retailers, wholesalers and catalog businesses. Internationally, we compete with retailers who operate department, drug, variety and specialty stores, supermarkets, supercenter-type stores, hypermarts, wholesale clubs, internet-based retailers and catalog businesses. Such retailers and wholesale club operators compete in a variety of ways, including merchandise selection and availability, services offered to customers, location, store hours, in-store amenities and price. Where necessary to compete effectively with competitors who price merchandise at points lower than the prices we set under our EDLP philosophy, we will lower our prices on goods for sale. Our ability to respond effectively to competitive pressures and changes in the retail markets could adversely affect our financial performance. See Item 1. Business above for additional discussion of our competitive situation in our various operating segments. Although the retail industry as a whole is highly fragmented, certain segments of the retail industry are currently undergoing some consolidation, which could result in increased competition and significantly alter the dynamics of the retail marketplace. Such consolidation may result in competitors with greatly improved financial resources, improved access to merchandise, greater market penetration than they previously enjoyed and other improvements in their competitive positions. Such business combinations could result in the provision of a wider variety of products and services at competitive prices by such consolidated companies, which could adversely affect our financial performance. Risks associated with the suppliers from whom our products are sourced and the safety of those products could adversely affect our financial performance. The products we sell are sourced from a wide variety of domestic and international suppliers. Global sourcing of many of the products we sell is an important factor in our financial performance. All of our suppliers must comply with applicable laws, including labor and environmental laws, and otherwise be certified as meeting our required supplier standards of conduct. Our ability to find qualified suppliers who meet our standards, and to access products in a timely and efficient manner is a significant challenge, especially with respect to suppliers located and goods sourced outside the United States. Political and economic instability in the countries in which foreign suppliers are located, the financial instability of suppliers, suppliers failure to meet our supplier standards, labor problems experienced by our suppliers, the availability of raw materials to suppliers, merchandise quality issues, currency exchange rates, transport availability and cost, transport security, inflation, and other factors relating to the suppliers and the countries in which they are located are beyond our control. In addition, the United States foreign trade policies, tariffs and other impositions on imported goods, trade sanctions imposed on certain countries, the limitation on the importation of certain types of goods or of goods containing certain materials from other countries and other factors relating to foreign trade are beyond our control. These and other factors affecting our suppliers and our access to products could adversely affect our financial performance. Our customers count on us to provide them with safe products. Concerns regarding the safety of food and non-food products that we source from our suppliers and then sell could cause shoppers to avoid purchasing certain products from us, or to seek alternative sources of supply for all of their food and non-food needs, even if the basis for the concern is outside of our control. Any lost confidence on the part of our customers would be difficult and costly to reestablish. As such, any issue regarding the safety of any food and non-food items we sell, regardless of the cause, could adversely affect our financial performance.  Our Walmart International operations subject us to risks associated with the legislative, judicial, accounting, regulatory, political and economic risks and conditions specific to the countries or regions in which we operate, which could adversely affect our financial performance. We currently conduct operations in Argentina, Brazil, Canada, Chile, Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Japan, Mexico, Nicaragua, and the United Kingdom, as well as through joint venture agreements in China and India and our other controlled subsidiaries in China. During fiscal 2011, our Walmart International operations generated 26.1% of our net sales. As a result of our expansion activities in countries outside the United States, we expect that our Walmart International operations could account for a larger portion of our net sales in future years. Our future operating results in these countries or in other countries or regions throughout the world could be negatively affected by a variety of factors, most of which are beyond our control. These factors include political conditions, including political instability, economic conditions, legal and regulatory constraints, trade policies, both of the United States and of the other countries in which we operate, currency regulations, and other matters in any of the countries or regions in which we operate, now or in the future. Foreign currency exchange rates and fluctuations may have an impact on our future costs or on future cash flows from our Walmart International operations, and could adversely affect our financial performance. Moreover, the economies of some of the countries in which we have operations have in the past suffered from high rates of inflation and currency devaluations, which, if they occurred again, could adversely affect our financial performance. Other factors which may impact our Walmart International operations include foreign trade, monetary and fiscal policies both of the United States and of other countries, laws, regulations and other activities of foreign governments, agencies and similar organizations, and risks associated with having numerous facilities located in countries which have historically been less stable than the United States. Additional risks inherent in our Walmart International operations generally include, among others, the costs and difficulties of managing international operations, adverse tax consequences and greater difficulty in enforcing intellectual property rights in countries other than the United States. The various risks inherent in doing business in the United States generally also exist when doing business outside of the United States, and may be exaggerated by the difficulty of doing business in numerous sovereign jurisdictions due to differences in culture, laws and regulations. Natural disasters and geo-political events could adversely affect our financial performance. The occurrence of one or more natural disasters, such as hurricanes, cyclones, typhoons, tropical storms, floods, earthquakes, tsunamis, weather conditions such as major or extended winter storms, droughts and tornados, whether as a result of climate change or otherwise, severe changes in climate and geo-political events, such as civil unrest or terrorist attacks in a country in which we operate or in which our suppliers are located could adversely affect our operations and financial performance. Such events could result in physical damage to, or the complete loss of, one or more of our properties, the closure of one or more stores, clubs and distribution centers, the lack of an adequate work force in a market, the inability of customers and our associates to reach or have transportation to our stores and clubs directly affected by such events, the evacuation of the populace from areas in which our stores, clubs and distributions centers are located, changes in the purchasing patterns of consumers and in consumers disposable income, the temporary or long-term disruption in the supply of products from some local and overseas suppliers, the disruption in the transport of goods from overseas, the disruption or delay in the delivery of goods to our distribution centers or stores within a country in which we are operating, the reduction in the availability of products in our stores, the disruption of utility services to our stores and our facilities, and disruption in our communications with our stores. These events and their impacts could otherwise disrupt and adversely affect our operations in the areas in which these types of events occur, such as the recent earthquake and tsunami in Japan, and could adversely affect our financial performance. In light of the substantial premiums payable for insurance coverage for losses caused by certain natural disasters, such as hurricanes, cyclones, typhoons, tropical storms, earthquakes, floods and tsunamis in the current insurance market, as well as the limitations on available coverage for such losses, we have chosen to be primarily self-insured with respect to such losses. Although we maintain certain specific coverages for losses from physical damages in excess of certain amounts to guard against catastrophic losses suffered from such causes, we still bear the risk of losses that would be incurred as a result of any physical damage to, or the destruction of, any stores, clubs and distribution centers, loss or spoilage of inventory, and business interruption caused by any such events below catastrophic levels of coverage, as well as in the event of a catastrophe, in excess of the aggregate limits of applicable coverages.  We are subject to certain legal proceedings that may adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. We are involved in a number of legal proceedings, which include consumer, employment, tort and other litigation. Certain of these lawsuits, if decided adversely to us or settled by us, may result in liability material to our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. We are currently a defendant in numerous cases containing class-action allegations in which the plaintiffs have brought claims under federal and state wage and hour laws. In addition, we are a defendant in Dukes v. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. , a class-action lawsuit brought on behalf of all past and present female employees in all of our retail stores and wholesale clubs in the United States. The class as certified in Dukes currently includes present and former female associates. The plaintiffs in this case allege that we have engaged in a pattern and practice of discriminating against women in promotions, pay, training and job assignments and seek, among other things, injunctive relief, front pay, back pay, punitive damages and attorneys fees. On June 4, 2004, the U.S. district court hearing this case issued an order granting in part and denying in part the plaintiffs motion for class certification, which we have appealed. On February 6, 2007, a divided three-judge panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit issued a decision affirming the district courts certification order. On February 20, 2007, the Company filed a petition asking that the decision be reconsidered by a larger panel of the Court of Appeals. On December 11, 2007, the three-judge panel withdrew its opinion of February 6, 2007, and issued a revised opinion. As a result, the Companys Petition for Rehearing En Banc was denied as moot. The Company filed a new Petition for Rehearing En Banc on January 8, 2008. On February 13, 2009, the court of appeals issued an Order granting the Petition. On April 26, 2010, the Ninth Circuit issued a divided (6-5) opinion affirming certain portions of the district courts ruling and reversing other portions. On August 25, 2010, the Company filed a petition for a writ of certiorari to the United States Supreme Court seeking review of the Ninth Circuits decision, which was granted by the United States Supreme Court on December 6, 2010. The Company filed its Brief for Petitioner on January 20, 2011; the Brief for Respondents was filed on February 22, 2011; and oral argument was held on March 29, 2011. We discuss these cases and other litigation to which we are party in greater detail below under the caption Item 3. Legal Proceedings and in Note 12 to our Consolidated Financial Statements, which are part of our Annual Report to Shareholders, which are incorporated by reference in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and are included as an exhibit to this Annual Report on Form 10-K. If we do not maintain the security of customer-related information, we could damage our reputation with customers, incur substantial additional costs and become subject to litigation. As do most retailers, we receive certain personal information about our customers. In addition, our online operations at www.walmart.com and www.samsclub.com depend upon the secure transmission of confidential information over public networks, including information permitting cashless payments. A compromise of our security systems that results in customer personal information being obtained by unauthorized persons could adversely affect our reputation with our customers and others, as well as our operations, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity, and could result in litigation against us or the imposition of penalties. In addition, a security breach could require that we expend significant additional resources related to our information security systems and could result in a disruption of our operations, particularly our online sales operations. We rely extensively on computer systems to process transactions, summarize results and manage our business. Disruptions in both our primary and secondary (back-up) systems could harm our ability to run our business. Although we have independent, redundant and physically separate primary and secondary computer systems, given the number of individual transactions we have each year, it is critical that we maintain uninterrupted operation of our business-critical computer systems. Our computer systems, including our back-up systems, are subject to damage or interruption from power outages, computer and telecommunications failures, computer viruses, security breaches, catastrophic events such as fires, tornadoes and hurricanes, and usage errors by our employees. If our computer systems and our back-up systems are damaged or cease to function properly, we may have to make a significant investment to repair or replace them, and we may suffer interruptions in our operations in the interim. Any material interruption in both of our computer systems and back-up systems may have a material adverse effect on our business or results of operations. In addition, we are pursuing complex initiatives to transform our information technology processes and systems, which will include, for many of our computer systems, establishing common processes across our lines of business. The risk of system disruption is increased when significant system changes are undertaken, although we believe that our change management process will mitigate this risk. If we fail to integrate our computer systems and processes we may fail to realize the cost savings anticipated to be derived from these initiatives.  We may not timely identify or effectively respond to consumer trends, which could negatively affect our relationship with our customers, the demand for our products and services, and our market share. It is difficult to predict consistently and successfully the products and services our customers will demand. The success of our business depends in part on our ability to identify and respond to evolving trends in demographics and consumer preferences. Failure to timely identify or effectively respond to changing consumer tastes, preferences and spending patterns could negatively affect our relationship with our customers, the demand for our products and services and our market share. ##TABLE_START ", "1B": " ITEM 1B.

PROPERTIES ##TABLE_END The number of discount stores, supercenters, Neighborhood Markets, other small formats, and Sams Clubs located in each state in the United States and Puerto Rico and the number of units located in each of the countries in which we operate are disclosed as of fiscal year-end January 31, 2011 in our Annual Report to Shareholders under the caption Fiscal 2011 Unit Count and are incorporated herein by reference. Portions of such Annual Report to Shareholders are included as an exhibit to this Annual Report on Form 10-K. United States. As of January 31, 2011, in the United States and Puerto Rico, we owned 3,293 of the buildings in which discount stores, supercenters, Neighborhood Markets and other small formats operated and 498 of the buildings in which our Sams Clubs in the United States and Puerto Rico operated. Land on which our stores are located is either owned or leased by the Company. In the United States, we lease the remaining buildings in which our stores and clubs operate from either commercial property developers pursuant to capital or operating lease arrangements or from local governmental entities in connection with industrial revenue bond financing arrangements. All store leases provide for annual rentals, some of which escalate during the original lease term. In some cases, the leases provide for additional rent based on sales volume. Substantially all of the Companys store and club leases have renewal options, some of which include escalation clauses causing an increase in rents. We use independent contractors to construct our buildings. Our 123 Walmart U.S. and 25 Sams Club distribution centers are located strategically throughout the continental United States and Puerto Rico. Of these 148 distribution facilities, we owned and operated 113 distribution facilities, and third parties owned and operated 35 of our distribution facilities. In addition to servicing the Walmart U.S. segment, some of our Walmart distribution centers also service our Sams Club segment for certain items. We own office facilities in Bentonville, Arkansas that serve as our home office and lease office facilities throughout the United States for our walmart.com operations and field management. Walmart International. We operate our Walmart International segment stores and restaurants in a combination of owned and leased properties in each country in which our Walmart International segment operates. As of the end of fiscal 2011, we owned 43 properties in Argentina, 175 properties in Brazil, 119 properties in Canada, 142 properties in Chile, 1 property in China, 78 properties in Costa Rica, 9 properties in El Salvador, 14 properties in Guatemala, 8 properties in Honduras, 52 properties in Japan, 566 properties in Mexico, 28 properties in Nicaragua and 250 properties in the United Kingdom. The remaining operating units in each such country are leased on terms that vary from property to property. We utilize both owned and leased properties for office facilities in each country in which we are conducting business. As of the end of fiscal 2011, our Walmart International operations are supported by 134 distribution facilities. Of these 134 distribution facilities, we owned and operated 34 and leased and operated 38. Third parties owned and operated the remaining 62 distribution facilities. For further information on our distribution centers, see the caption Distribution provided for each of our segments under Item 1. Business. ##TABLE_START ", "3": " ITEM 3.

ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS: Item 103 of SEC Regulation S-K requires disclosure of certain environmental matters. The following matters are disclosed in accordance with that requirement: On November 8, 2005, the Company received a grand jury subpoena from the United States Attorneys Office for the Central District of California, seeking documents and information relating to the Companys receipt, transportation, handling, identification, recycling, treatment, storage and disposal of certain merchandise that constitutes hazardous materials or hazardous waste. The Company has been informed by the U.S. Attorneys Office for the Central District of California that it is a target of a criminal investigation into potential violations of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (the RCRA), the Clean Water Act and the Hazardous Materials Transportation Statute. This U.S. Attorneys Office contends, among other things, that the use of Company trucks to transport certain returned merchandise from the Companys stores to its return centers is prohibited by RCRA because those materials may be considered hazardous waste. The government alleges that, to comply with RCRA, the Company must ship from the store certain materials as hazardous waste directly to a certified disposal facility using a certified hazardous waste carrier. The U.S. Attorneys Office in the Northern District of California subsequently joined in this investigation. The Company contends that the practice of transporting returned merchandise to its return centers for subsequent disposition, including disposal by certified facilities, is compliant with applicable laws and regulations. While management cannot predict the ultimate outcome of this matter, management does not believe the outcome will have a material effect on the Companys financial condition or results of operations. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (the EPA) approached a grocery industry group to resolve issues relating to refrigerant-handling practices and to reduce the use of ozone-depleting refrigerants in refrigeration equipment. The Company then approached the EPA independently to address these issues, and proposed a plan for removing ozone-depleting refrigerants from certain types of refrigeration equipment. While management cannot predict the ultimate outcome of this matter, management does not believe the outcome will have a material effect on the Companys financial condition or results of operations. In January 2007, Wal-Mart Puerto Rico, Inc. became aware that the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (the USACE) was concerned about alleged violations of a permit issued by that agency in 2003, for the fill of 0.23 acres of a creek and its contiguous wetlands during the construction of the Wal-Mart Store in Caguas, Puerto Rico. On January 19, 2007, Wal-Mart Puerto Rico responded to these issues in writing. On January 25, 2007, the USACE issued a formal Notice of Non-Compliance to Wal-Mart Puerto Rico regarding this matter. Wal-Mart Puerto Rico filed a formal response, implemented mitigation measures, and continues to monitor and provide the required maintenance to the mitigation area. While management cannot predict the ultimate outcome of this matter, management does not believe the outcome will have a material effect on the Companys financial condition or results of operations. On March 28, 2008, the Company received a Notice of Violation from the Missouri Department of Natural Resources (the Department) alleging various violations of Missouri hazardous waste laws and regulations in connection with the activities of a third-party contractor with whom the Company had contracted for recycling services. The Department alleges that the Company provided certain items to the contractor for recycling that should have been managed as hazardous waste. The EPA has inspected the contractors facilities, and both the EPA and the U.S. Attorneys Office for the Western District of Missouri are conducting investigations. The Company has submitted a response to the Notice of Violation and is cooperating with these authorities. While management cannot predict the ultimate outcome of this matter, management does not believe the outcome will have a material effect on the Companys financial condition or results of operations. On August 19, 2009, the Office of the District Attorney for Riverside County, California, notified the Company that it had instituted an investigation into whether violations of California laws regarding underground storage tanks occurred at two Sams Club stations. The Company and the District Attorney have resolved the matter, and the settlement was approved by the court on November 22, 2010. As part of the settlement, the Company paid $750,000 in civil penalties and $200,000 in costs.  In January, 2011, the Environmental Department of Porto Alegre Municipality formally notified WMS Supermercados do Brasil Ltda of soil inspection reports indicating soil contamination due to leakage of oil from power generating equipment at nine store locations in Brazil. WMS Supermercados do Brasil Ltda is cooperating with the agency as well as the District Attorneys Office for the State of Rio Grande do Sul and has filed a mitigation plan to address the situation. While management cannot predict the ultimate outcome of this matter, management does not believe the outcome will have a material effect on the Companys financial condition or results of operations. ##TABLE_START ITEM 4.

MARKET FOR REGISTRANTS COMMON EQUITY, RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS AND ISSUER PURCHASES OF EQUITY SECURITIES ##TABLE_END Certain information required to be provided in this item is incorporated herein by reference to the information included under the captions Market price of common stock, Listing and Dividends paid per share in our Annual Report to Shareholders. Such information appears in the portion of the Annual Report to Shareholders that is an exhibit to this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Our common stock is principally traded in the United States on the New York Stock Exchange. At March 21, 2011, the latest practicable date, there were 283,633 common stock shareholders of record. On June 3, 2010, the Board of Directors authorized a new $15.0 billion share repurchase program, which was announced on June 4, 2010. The program has no expiration date or other restriction limiting the period over which we can make our share repurchases and will expire only when and if we have repurchased $15.0 billion of our shares under the program or we earlier terminate or replace the program. Any repurchased shares are constructively retired and returned to an unissued status. We spent approximately $14.8 billion, $7.3 billion and $3.5 billion for share repurchases during the fiscal years ended January 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. We consider several factors in determining when to execute the share repurchases, including among other things, our current cash needs, our capacity for leverage, our cost of borrowings and the market price of our common stock. At January 31, 2011, we had $4.8 billion of remaining authorization for share repurchases under the existing program.

CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES ##TABLE_END Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures We maintain a system of disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to provide reasonable assurance that information, which is required to be timely disclosed, is accumulated and communicated to management in a timely fashion. In designing and evaluating such controls and procedures, we recognize that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. Our management is necessarily required to use judgment in evaluating controls and procedures. Also, we may have investments in certain unconsolidated entities. Since we do not control or manage those entities, our controls and procedures with respect to those entities are substantially more limited than those we maintain with respect to our consolidated subsidiaries. In the ordinary course of business, we review our system of internal control over financial reporting and make changes to our systems and processes to improve such controls and increase efficiency, while ensuring that we maintain an effective internal control environment. Changes may include such activities as implementing new, more efficient systems and automating manual processes. In the second quarter of fiscal 2010, we began implementing a new financial system in stages and to date, have completed implementations in the United States and Puerto Rico, the United Kingdom, Canada and Japan. We plan to implement our new financial system in Mexico during the second quarter of fiscal 2012. The new financial system is a significant component of our internal control over financial reporting. We will continue to implement our new financial system in stages, and each implementation may become a significant component of our internal control over financial reporting. An evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures was performed as of the end of the period covered by this report. This evaluation was performed under the supervision and with the participation of management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer. Based upon that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are effective to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files or submits under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, is accumulated and communicated to management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure and are effective to provide reasonable assurance that such information is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified by the SECs rules and forms.

Walton opened a franchise Ben Franklin variety store in Newport, Arkansas. In 1946, his brother, James L. Walton, opened a similar store in Versailles, Missouri. Until 1962, our founders business was devoted entirely to the operation of variety stores. In that year, the first Wal-Mart Discount City, which was a discount store, opened in Rogers, Arkansas. In fiscal 1984, we opened our first three Sams Clubs, and in fiscal 1988, we opened our first supercenter. In fiscal 1999, we opened our first Neighborhood Market. In fiscal 1992, we began our first international initiative when we entered into a joint venture in Mexico, in which we owned a 50% interest along with Cifra S.A. de C.V. (Cifra). In 1998, we acquired the controlling interest in Cifra, and in February 2000, Cifra officially changed its name to Wal-Mart de Mexico, S.A. de C.V.

The merchandising strategy for the Walmart International segment is similar to that of our operations in the United States in terms of the breadth and scope of merchandise offered for sale. While brand name merchandise accounts for a majority of sales, numerous store brands not offered for sale in the U.S. stores and clubs have been developed to serve customers in the different markets in which the Walmart International segment operates. In addition, steps have been taken to develop relationships with local suppliers in each country to ensure reliable sources of quality merchandise. Operations. The hours of operation for operating units in the Walmart International segment vary by country and by individual markets within countries, depending upon local and national ordinances governing hours of operation. We accept a variety of payment methods including cash, check, debit and credit cards, private-label store credit cards issued by third-party providers, and in Canada, Chile and Mexico, credit cards issued by our subsidiaries. Limited consumer finance programs exist in certain markets to facilitate the purchase of goods by the customer. Across the Walmart International segment, we are leveraging best practices, lessons from multiple store formats and global sourcing practices. Seasonal Aspects of Operations. The Walmart International segments business is seasonal to a certain extent. Historically, the segments highest sales volume and operating income occur in our fiscal quarter ending January 31 and the segments lowest sales volume and operating income occur in the fiscal quarter ending April 30. The seasonality of the business varies by country due to different national and religious holidays, festivals and customs, as well as different climatic conditions. Competition. The Walmart International segment competes with a variety of local, national and global chains in the supermarket, discount, grocery, department, drug, variety and specialty stores, supercenter-type stores, hypermarkets, wholesale clubs, internet-based retailers and catalog businesses in each of the countries in which we operate. We also operate restaurant chains and consumer finance operations. Our ability to offer our customers low prices on quality merchandise determines, to a large extent, our competitive position in the countries in which Walmart International operates. EDLP is the right business model for our customers and for all of our markets, including high-growth or emerging markets. We are in the midst of a multi-year plan to transition all of our markets to EDLP. Our ability to operate the food departments effectively has a major impact on the segments competitive position in the markets where we operate.  Distribution. We utilize a total of 158 distribution facilities located in Argentina, Brazil, Canada, Central America, Chile, China, India, Japan, Mexico, South Africa and the United Kingdom, including one export consolidation facility in the United States. Through these facilities, we process and distribute both imported and domestic products to the operating units of the Walmart International segment. During fiscal 2012, approximately 75% of the Walmart International segments purchases flowed through these distribution facilities. Suppliers ship the balance of the Walmart International segments purchases directly to our stores in the various countries in which we operate. Of these 158 distribution facilities, we owned and operated 39, we owned and third parties operated 9 and we leased and operated 68. Third parties leased and operated the remaining 42 distribution facilities.

Operating hours for Sams Clubs are Monday through Friday from 10:00 a.m. to 8:30 p.m., Saturday from 9:00 a.m. to 8:30 p.m. and Sunday from 10:00 a.m. to 6:00 p.m. Additionally, all club locations offer a Gold Key program that permits Business Members and Plus Members to shop before the regular operating hours Monday through Saturday, starting at 7:00 a.m. Sams Clubs are membership only operations. A variety of payment methods are accepted at our clubs, including cash, check, debit cards, certain types of credit cards and private label and co-branded Discover credit cards, issued by a third-party provider. In addition, our pharmacy and optical departments accept payments for products and services through our members health benefit plans. Members include both business owners and individual consumers. Individual consumers are referred to as Advantage Members. The annual membership fee for an individual Advantage Member is $40 (plus taxes, if applicable) for the primary membership card, with a spouse/household card available at no additional cost. The annual membership fee for Business Members is $35 (plus taxes, if applicable) for the primary membership card, with a spouse/household card available at no additional cost. In addition, Business Members can add up to 8 business associates to their business account for $35 (plus taxes, if applicable) each. Sams Club Plus is a premium membership program that offers additional benefits and services to both Business and Advantage Members. The annual fee for a Plus Member (Business or Advantage) is $100 (plus taxes, if applicable). In addition, Business Plus Members can add up to 16 business associates to their business membership for $35 (plus taxes, if applicable) each. Seasonal Aspects of Operations. The Sams Club segments business is seasonal to a certain extent due to different calendar events, national and religious holidays, as well as different climatic conditions. Historically, its highest sales volume and segment operating income occur in the fiscal quarter ending January 31, which includes the holiday season, and the lowest sales volume and segment operating income occur during the fiscal quarter ending April 30. Competition. Sams Club competes with other warehouse clubs, as well as with discount retailers, retail and wholesale grocers, general merchandise wholesalers and distributors, gasoline stations, internet-based retailers and catalog businesses. Sams Club also competes with other retailers and warehouse clubs for desirable new club sites. Our ability to offer low prices and quality merchandise and food to meet the needs of our members largely determines our competitive position in the warehouse club industry. Distribution. During fiscal 2012, approximately 63% of the Sams Club segments non-fuel purchases were shipped from the Sams Club segments dedicated distribution facilities and from some of the Walmart U.S. segments distribution centers. Suppliers shipped the balance of the Sams Club segments purchases directly to Sams Club locations. As of January 31, 2012, our Sams Club segment operations were supported by 25 distribution facilities located strategically throughout the continental United States. Of these 25 distribution facilities, we owned and operated 8. Third parties owned and operated the remaining 17 distribution facilities. The principal focus of our Sams Clubs distribution operations is on cross-docking merchandise, while stored inventory is minimized. Cross-docking is a distribution process under which shipments are directly transferred from inbound to outbound trailers. Shipments typically spend less than 24 hours in a cross-dock facility, sometimes less than an hour. Sams Club uses a combination of our private truck fleet, as well as common carriers, to transport non-perishable merchandise from distribution centers to clubs. We contract with common carriers to transport perishable grocery merchandise from distribution centers to clubs.  Other Segment Information Certain financial information relating to our segments is included in our Annual Report to Shareholders for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2012 (Annual Report to Shareholders) under the caption Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and in Note 15 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included therein, which information is incorporated herein by reference. Note 15 includes information regarding our segment and total company net sales, as well as long-lived assets in the United States. Portions of the Annual Report to Shareholders are included as an exhibit to this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Employees As of the end of fiscal 2012, the Company and its subsidiaries employed approximately 2.2 million employees (associates) worldwide, with approximately 1.4 million associates in the United States and 0.8 million associates internationally. Similar to other retailers, the Company has a large number of part-time, hourly or non-exempt associates and experiences significant turnover in associates each year. Through fiscal 2011, the Company maintained separate profit sharing and 401(k) plans for associates in the United States and Puerto Rico, under which associates generally became participants following one year of employment. The profit sharing component was entirely funded by the Company, and the Company also made additional contributions to the 401(k) component of the plan. In addition to the Companys contributions, associates could elect to contribute a percentage of their earnings to the 401(k) component of the plan. Effective February 1, 2011, the Company terminated the previous profit sharing and 401(k) plans and offered new safe harbor 401(k) plans for associates in the United States and Puerto Rico, under which associates generally become participants following one year of employment. Under the safe harbor 401(k) plans, the Company matches 100% of participant contributions up to 6% of annual eligible earnings. The matching contributions immediately vest at 100% for each associate. Participants can contribute up to 50% of their pretax earnings, but not more than the statutory limits. Participants age 50 or older may defer additional earnings in catch-up contributions up to the maximum statutory limits. Contribution expense associated with these plans was $752 million in fiscal 2012 and $1.1 billion in fiscal 2011 and 2010. In addition, in the U.S., the Company offers a broad range of Company-paid benefits to our associates, including store discount cards or Sams Club memberships, bonuses based on Company performance, matching a portion of purchases through the Associate Stock Purchase Plan and life insurance. The Company also offers health-care benefits to eligible full-time and part-time associates. The Companys medical plan has no lifetime maximum benefit for most expenses. In our operations outside the U.S., the Company provides a variety of associate benefits that vary based on customary local practices and statutory requirements.

RISK FACTORS ##TABLE_END The risks described below could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. These risks are not the only risks that we face. Our business operations could also be affected by additional factors that apply to all companies operating in the United States and globally, as well as other risks that are not presently known to us or that we currently consider to be immaterial to our operations. General economic factors, both domestically and internationally, may adversely affect our financial performance. General economic conditions, globally or in one or more of the markets we serve, may adversely affect our financial performance. In the United States, higher interest rates, higher fuel and other energy costs, weakness in the housing market, inflation, deflation, higher levels of unemployment, decreases in consumer disposable income, unavailability of consumer credit, higher consumer debt levels, fluctuations in currency exchange rates, higher tax rates and other changes in tax laws, other regulatory changes, overall economic slowdown and other economic factors could adversely affect consumer demand for the products and services we sell through our Walmart U.S. segment and Sams Club segment, change the mix of products we sell to one with a lower average gross margin, cause a slowdown in discretionary purchases of goods and result in slower inventory turnover and greater markdowns on inventory. Higher levels of unemployment, inflation, deflation, decreases in consumer disposable income, changes in tax and other laws, higher fuel and other energy costs, weakness in the local housing market, fluctuations in currency exchange rates, currency devaluations and other adverse developments in the economies of the other countries in which we operate may adversely affect consumer demand for our merchandise in those countries, especially those countries in which average incomes are significantly lower than in the United States. These conditions may adversely affect our gross margins, cost of sales, inventory turnover and markdowns or otherwise adversely affect our operations and operating results in our Walmart International segment. Higher interest rates, higher fuel and other energy costs, transportation costs, inflation, higher costs of labor, insurance and healthcare, foreign exchange rate fluctuations, higher tax rates and other changes in tax laws, the imposition of measures that create barriers to or increase the costs associated with international trade, changes in other laws and regulations and other economic factors in the United States and other countries in which we have operations can increase our cost of sales and operating, selling, general and administrative expenses, and otherwise adversely affect our domestic and international operations and our operating results. The economic factors that affect our operations also affect the operations and economic viability of our suppliers from whom we purchase goods, a factor that can result in an increase in the cost to us of the goods we sell to our customers or, in more extreme cases, could result in certain suppliers not producing goods in the volume typically available to us for sale. We may face impediments to our expansion in the United States, including conversions of discount stores into supercenters and opening other store formats, which may adversely affect our financial performance. Our expansion strategy depends upon our ability to execute our retail concepts successfully in new markets within the United States and upon our ability to increase the number of stores in markets in which we currently have operations. Our ability to open additional supercenters, discount stores, Neighborhood Markets, other store formats, and Sams Clubs and to convert existing discount stores into supercenters depends in large measure upon our ability to locate, hire and retain qualified personnel  and to acquire new store sites on acceptable terms. Local land use and other regulations restricting the construction of buildings of the type in which we operate our various formats, as well as local community action opposed to the location of specific stores at specific sites and the adoption of certain local laws restricting our operations, may affect our ability to open new stores and clubs, to convert discount stores into supercenters or to relocate or expand existing units in certain cities and states. Increased real estate, construction and development costs could limit our growth opportunities and our ability to convert our discount stores into supercenters. If we are unable to open new supercenters, discount stores, Neighborhood Markets, other small formats or Sams Clubs or continue to convert discount stores into supercenters, our financial performance, such as net sales and operating income growth, could be adversely affected. In addition, if consumers in the markets into which we expand are not receptive to our retail concepts or are otherwise not receptive to our presence in a market, our financial performance could be adversely affected. Impediments to the expansion of our Walmart International operations could adversely affect our financial performance. Our business strategy for our Walmart International segment includes expansion by selective acquisitions and strategic alliances that add new stores and markets to our existing Walmart International business, as well as opening new units in the countries in which we have existing operations. In the countries in which we have existing operations, new units may be opened in the formats already existing in those countries or may be opened in newly introduced formats, such as supercenters or Sams Clubs, not previously operated in those markets. As in the United States, our ability to open new stores or to expand or relocate existing stores in a market served by our Walmart International segment depends in large measure upon our ability to locate, hire and retain qualified personnel and our ability to acquire new store sites on acceptable terms. Local laws can affect our ability to acquire attractive pre-existing buildings in which to locate units or sites on which to build new units or to expand existing units. In addition, access to local suppliers of certain types of goods may limit our ability to add new units or to expand product selections in existing units in certain markets. Moreover, cultural differences in some markets into which we expand or into which we introduce new retail concepts may result in the consumers in those markets not being as receptive to our retail concepts as we anticipate those consumers will be and may make an effective response to such issues more difficult to achieve. If we do not effectively execute our expansion plans for our Walmart International segment, our financial performance could be adversely affected. We may be unable to continue to identify suitable acquisition candidates at acceptable prices and may not be successful in completing the acquisition of any such candidate identified. Although we ultimately believe we will be able to successfully integrate any newly acquired operations into our existing operations, no certainty exists that future acquisitions or alliances will be successfully integrated into our operations or can be successfully integrated in a reasonable time. Our failure to identify appropriate candidates for acquisition or alliance or to integrate effectively future acquisitions and alliances into our existing operations could adversely affect the growth of our Walmart International segment and our future financial performance. Failure to attract and retain qualified associates, changes in laws and other labor issues could adversely affect our financial performance. Our ability to continue to expand our operations in the United States and abroad depends on our ability to attract and retain a large and growing number of qualified associates. Our ability to meet our labor needs, including our ability to find qualified personnel to fill positions that become vacant at our existing stores, clubs and distribution centers, while controlling our associate wage and related labor costs, is generally subject to numerous external factors, including the availability of a sufficient number of qualified persons in the work force of the markets in which we are located, unemployment levels within those markets, prevailing wage rates, changing demographics, health and other insurance costs and adoption of new or revised employment and labor laws and regulations. If we are unable to locate, to attract or to retain qualified personnel, if our costs of labor or related costs increase significantly or if new or revised labor laws, rules or regulations are adopted, our financial performance could be adversely affected. We face strong competition from other retailers and wholesale club operators, which could adversely affect our financial performance. The retail business is highly competitive. Each of our business segments competes for customers, employees, store sites, products and services and in other important aspects of its business with many other local, regional and national retailers, both in the United States and in the foreign countries in which we have operations. Our Walmart U.S. segment competes with retailers operating discount, department, drug, dollar, variety and specialty stores, supermarkets, supercenter-type stores and hypermarkets, as well as internet-based retailers and catalog businesses. Our Sams Club segment competes with other wholesale club operators, as well as discount retailers, retail and wholesale grocers and general merchandise wholesalers and distributors, gasoline stations, as well as internet-based retailers, wholesalers and catalog businesses. Internationally, we compete with retailers who operate department, drug, dollar stores, variety and specialty stores, supermarkets, supercenter-type stores, hypermarkets, wholesale clubs, internet-based retailers and catalog businesses. Such retailers and wholesale club  operators compete in a variety of ways, including merchandise selection and availability, services offered to customers, location, store hours, in-store amenities and price. Where necessary to compete effectively with competitors who price merchandise at points lower than the prices we set under our EDLP philosophy, we will lower our prices on goods for sale. Our ability to respond effectively to competitive pressures and changes in the retail markets could adversely affect our financial performance. See Item 1. Business above for additional discussion of our competitive situation in our various operating segments. Although the retail industry as a whole is highly fragmented, certain segments of the retail industry are currently undergoing some consolidation, which could result in increased competition and significantly alter the dynamics of the retail marketplace. Such consolidation may result in competitors with greatly improved financial resources, improved access to merchandise, greater market penetration than they previously enjoyed and other improvements in their competitive positions. Such business combinations could result in the provision of a wider variety of products and services at competitive prices by such consolidated companies, which could adversely affect our financial performance. Risks associated with the suppliers from whom our products are sourced and the safety of those products could adversely affect our financial performance. The products we sell are sourced from a wide variety of domestic and international suppliers. Global sourcing of many of the products we sell is an important factor in our financial performance. All of our suppliers must comply with applicable laws, including labor and environmental laws, and otherwise be certified as meeting our required supplier standards of conduct. Our ability to find qualified suppliers who meet our standards and to access products in a timely and efficient manner is a significant challenge, especially with respect to suppliers located and goods sourced outside the United States. Political and economic instability in the countries in which foreign suppliers are located, the financial instability of suppliers, suppliers failure to meet our supplier standards, labor problems experienced by our suppliers, the availability of raw materials to suppliers, merchandise quality issues, currency exchange rates, transportation availability and cost, transportation security, inflation and other factors relating to the suppliers and the countries in which they are located are beyond our control. In addition, the United States foreign trade policies, tariffs and other impositions on imported goods, trade sanctions imposed on certain countries, the limitation on the importation of certain types of goods or of goods containing certain materials from other countries and other factors relating to foreign trade are beyond our control. These and other factors affecting our suppliers and our access to products could adversely affect our financial performance. Our customers count on us to provide them with safe products. Concerns regarding the safety of food and non-food products that we source from our suppliers and then sell could cause shoppers to avoid purchasing certain products from us or to seek alternative sources of supply for all of their food and non-food needs, even if the basis for the concern is outside of our control. Any lost confidence on the part of our customers would be difficult and costly to reestablish. As such, any issue regarding the safety of any food and non-food items we sell, regardless of the cause, could adversely affect our financial performance. Our Walmart International operations subject us to risks associated with the legislative, judicial, accounting, regulatory, political and economic risks and conditions specific to the countries or regions in which we operate, which could adversely affect our financial performance. We currently conduct operations in 12 countries in Africa, Argentina, Brazil, Canada, Chile, China, 5 countries in Central America, Japan, Mexico and the United Kingdom, as well as through joint venture agreements in China and India and our other controlled subsidiaries in China. During fiscal 2012, our Walmart International operations generated approximately 28% of our net sales. As a result of our expansion activities in countries outside the United States, we expect that our Walmart International operations could account for a larger portion of our net sales in future years. Our future operating results in these countries or in other countries or regions throughout the world could be negatively affected by a variety of factors, most of which are beyond our control. These factors include political conditions, including political instability, economic conditions, legal and regulatory constraints, trade policies, both of the United States and of the other countries in which we operate, currency regulations, and other matters in any of the countries or regions in which we operate, now or in the future. Foreign currency exchange rates and fluctuations may have an impact on our future costs or on future cash flows from our Walmart International operations, and could adversely affect our financial performance. Moreover, the economies of some of the countries in which we have operations have in the past suffered from high rates of inflation and currency devaluations, which, if they occurred again, could adversely affect our financial performance. Other factors which may impact our Walmart International operations include foreign trade, monetary and fiscal policies both of the United States and of other countries, laws, regulations and other activities of foreign governments, agencies and similar organizations, and risks associated with having numerous facilities located in countries which have historically been less stable than the United States. Additional risks inherent in our Walmart International operations generally include, among others, the costs and difficulties of managing international operations, adverse tax consequences and greater difficulty in enforcing intellectual property rights in countries other than the United States. The various risks inherent in doing business in the United States generally also exist when doing business outside of the United States, and may be exaggerated by the difficulty of doing business in numerous sovereign jurisdictions due to differences in culture, laws and regulations.  Natural disasters and geo-political events could adversely affect our financial performance. The occurrence of one or more natural disasters, such as hurricanes, cyclones, typhoons, tropical storms, floods, earthquakes, tsunamis, weather conditions such as major or extended winter storms, droughts and tornados, whether as a result of climate change or otherwise, severe changes in climate and geo-political events, such as civil unrest or terrorist attacks in a country in which we operate or in which our suppliers are located could adversely affect our operations and financial performance. Such events could result in physical damage to, or the complete loss of, one or more of our properties, the closure of one or more stores, clubs and distribution centers, the lack of an adequate work force in a market, the inability of customers and our associates to reach or have transportation to our stores and clubs directly affected by such events, the evacuation of the populace from areas in which our stores, clubs and distributions centers are located, changes in the purchasing patterns of consumers and in consumers disposable income, the temporary or long-term disruption in the supply of products from some local and overseas suppliers, the disruption in the transport of goods from overseas, the disruption or delay in the delivery of goods to our distribution centers or stores within a country in which we are operating, the reduction in the availability of products in our stores, the disruption of utility services to our stores and our facilities, and disruption in our communications with our stores. These events and their impacts could otherwise disrupt and adversely affect our operations in the areas in which these types of events occur, such as the March 2011 earthquake and tsunami in Japan, and could adversely affect our financial performance. In light of the substantial premiums payable for insurance coverage for losses caused by certain natural disasters, such as hurricanes, cyclones, typhoons, tropical storms, earthquakes, floods and tsunamis in the current insurance market, as well as the limitations on available coverage for such losses, we have chosen to be primarily self-insured with respect to such losses. Although we maintain certain specific coverages for losses from physical damages in excess of certain amounts to guard against catastrophic losses suffered from such causes, we still bear the risk of losses that would be incurred as a result of any physical damage to, or the destruction of, any stores, clubs and distribution centers, loss or spoilage of inventory, and business interruption caused by any such events below catastrophic levels of coverage, as well as in the event of a catastrophe, in excess of the aggregate limits of applicable coverages. We are subject to certain legal proceedings that may adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. We are involved in a number of legal proceedings, which include consumer, employment, tort and other litigation. Certain of these lawsuits, if decided adversely to us or settled by us, may result in liability material to our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. We are currently a defendant in numerous cases containing class-action allegations in which the plaintiffs have brought claims under federal and state wage and hour laws. In addition, we are a defendant in Dukes v. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. , which was commenced as a class-action lawsuit in June 2001 in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California, asserting that the Company had engaged in a pattern and practice of discriminating against women in promotions, pay, training, and job assignments, and seeking, among other things, injunctive relief, front pay, back pay, punitive damages, and attorneys fees. On June 21, 2004, the U.S. district court issued an order granting in part and denying in part the plaintiffs motion for class certification. As defined by the U.S. district court, the class included [a]ll women employed at any Wal-Mart domestic retail store at any time since December 26, 1998, who have been or may be subjected to Wal-Marts challenged pay and management track promotions policies and practices. The Company appealed the order to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals and subsequently to the United States Supreme Court. On June 20, 2011, the Supreme Court issued an opinion decertifying the class and remanding the case to the district court. On October 27, 2011, the plaintiffs attorneys filed an amended complaint proposing a class of current and former female associates at the Companys California retail facilities, and the Company filed a Motion to Dismiss on January 13, 2012. On October 28, 2011, the plaintiffs attorneys filed a complaint in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Texas entitled Odle v. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. , proposing a class of current and former female associates at the Companys Texas retail facilities and asserting claims and relief similar to those in the Dukes case. The Company filed a Motion to Dismiss on March 5, 2012. We discuss this case and other litigation to which we are a party in greater detail below under the caption Item 3. Legal Proceedings and in Note 11 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, which are part of our Annual Report to Shareholders, which are incorporated by reference in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and are included as an exhibit to this Annual Report on Form 10-K.  If we do not maintain the security of information relating to our customers, associates and vendors, security information breaches through cybersecurity attacks or otherwise could damage our reputation with customers, associates and vendors, and we could incur substantial additional costs and become subject to litigation. As do most retailers, we receive certain personal information about our customers, and we also receive personal information concerning our associates and vendors. In addition, our online operations at www.walmart.com , www.samsclub.com and other websites depend upon the secure transmission of confidential information over public networks, including information permitting cashless payments. We maintain security measures with respect to such information, but despite these measures, we may be vulnerable to security breaches by computer hackers and others that attempt to penetrate the security measures that we have in place. A compromise of our security systems (through cyber-attacks or otherwise which are rapidly evolving and sophisticated) that results in personal information being obtained by unauthorized persons could adversely affect our reputation with our customers, associates, and vendors, as well as our operations, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity, and could result in litigation against us or the imposition of penalties. In addition, a security breach could require that we expend significant additional resources related to our information security systems and could result in a disruption of our operations, particularly our online sales operations. We rely extensively on computer systems to process transactions, summarize results and manage our business. Disruptions in both our primary and secondary (back-up) systems could harm our ability to run our business. Although we have independent, redundant and physically separate primary and secondary computer systems, given the number of individual transactions we have each year, it is critical that we maintain uninterrupted operation of our business-critical computer systems. Our computer systems, including our back-up systems, are subject to damage or interruption from power outages, computer and telecommunications failures, computer viruses, security breaches (through cyber-attacks from computer hackers and sophisticated organizations), catastrophic events such as fires, tornadoes and hurricanes, and usage errors by our associates. If our computer systems and our back-up systems are damaged, breached or cease to function properly, we may have to make a significant investment to repair or replace them, and we may suffer interruptions in our operations in the interim. Any material interruption in both of our computer systems and back-up systems may have a material adverse effect on our business or results of operations. In addition, we are pursuing complex initiatives to transform our information technology processes and systems, which will include, for many of our computer systems, establishing common processes across our lines of business. The risk of system disruption is increased when significant system changes are undertaken, although we believe that our change management process will mitigate this risk. If we fail to integrate our computer systems and processes we may fail to realize the cost savings anticipated to be derived from these initiatives. We may not timely identify or effectively respond to consumer trends, which could negatively affect our relationship with our customers, the demand for our products and services, and our market share. It is difficult to predict consistently and successfully the products and services our customers will demand. The success of our business depends in part on our ability to identify and respond to evolving trends in demographics and consumer preferences. Failure to timely identify or effectively respond to changing consumer tastes, preferences and spending patterns could negatively affect our relationship with our customers, the demand for our products and services and our market share. ##TABLE_START ", "1B": " ITEM 1B.

The following environmental matters are disclosed in accordance with that requirement, as well as other matters. Environmental: On November 8, 2005, the Company received a grand jury subpoena from the United States Attorneys Office for the Central District of California, seeking documents and information relating to the Companys receipt, transportation, handling, identification, recycling, treatment, storage and disposal of certain merchandise that constitutes hazardous materials or hazardous waste. The Company has been informed by the U.S. Attorneys Office for the Central District of California that it is a target of a criminal investigation into potential violations of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (the RCRA), the Clean Water Act and the Hazardous Materials Transportation Statute. This U.S. Attorneys Office contends, among other things, that the use of Company trucks to transport certain returned merchandise from the Companys stores to its return centers is prohibited by RCRA because those materials may be considered hazardous waste. The government alleges that, to comply with RCRA, the Company must ship from the store certain materials as hazardous waste directly to a certified disposal facility using a certified hazardous waste carrier. The U.S. Attorneys Office in the Northern District of California and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (the EPA) subsequently joined in this investigation. The Company contends that the practice of transporting returned merchandise to its return centers for subsequent disposition, including disposal by certified facilities, is compliant with applicable laws and regulations. While management cannot predict the ultimate outcome of this matter, management does not believe the outcome will have a material effect on the Companys financial condition or results of operations.  In January 2007, Wal-Mart Puerto Rico, Inc. became aware that the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (the USACE) was concerned about alleged violations of a permit issued by that agency in 2003, for the fill of 0.23 acres of a creek and its contiguous wetlands during the construction of the Wal-Mart Store in Caguas, Puerto Rico. On January 19, 2007, Wal-Mart Puerto Rico responded to these issues in writing. On January 25, 2007, the USACE issued a formal Notice of Non-Compliance to Wal-Mart Puerto Rico regarding this matter. Wal-Mart Puerto Rico filed a formal response, implemented mitigation measures, and continues to monitor and provide the required maintenance to the mitigation area. While management cannot predict the ultimate outcome of this matter, management does not believe the outcome will have a material effect on the Companys financial condition or results of operations. On March 28, 2008, the Company received a Notice of Violation from the Missouri Department of Natural Resources (the Department) alleging various violations of Missouri hazardous waste laws and regulations in connection with the activities of a third-party contractor with whom the Company had contracted for recycling services. The Department alleged that the Company provided certain items to the contractor for recycling that should have been managed as hazardous waste. The Company has resolved the issues with the Department by entering into a settlement agreement which includes payment of a $214,378 penalty and an agreement to implement a supplemental environmental project valued at $1,050,000 to help local residents properly manage household hazardous wastes. The EPA inspected the contractors facilities, and both the EPA and the U.S. Attorneys Office for the Western District of Missouri are conducting investigations. The Company is cooperating with these authorities. While management cannot predict the ultimate outcome of this matter, management does not believe the outcome will have a material effect on the Companys financial condition or results of operations. In March 2011, the Office of the District Attorney for Riverside County, California, notified the Company that it had initiated an investigation of whether third party contractors hired by the Company had violated California laws regarding the disposal of construction materials at a local landfill. The Company is cooperating with the District Attorneys Office. While management cannot predict the ultimate outcome of this matter, management does not believe the outcome will have a material effect on the Companys financial condition or results of operations. In January 2011, the Environmental Department of Porto Alegre Municipality formally notified WMS Supermercados do Brasil Ltda, a subsidiary of the Company, of soil inspection reports indicating soil contamination due to leakage of oil from power generating equipment at nine store locations in Brazil. WMS Supermercados do Brasil Ltda is cooperating with the agency as well as the District Attorneys Office for the State of Rio Grande do Sul and has filed a mitigation plan to address the situation. While management cannot predict the ultimate outcome of this matter, management does not believe the outcome will have a material effect on the Companys financial condition or results of operations. In July 2011, the Environmental Patrol and the Environmental Department for Bento Goncalves Municipality, Brazil, notified WMS Supermercados do Brasil Ltda that they are investigating alleged soil contamination involving a leaking subsoil oil duct at a store site. To resolve this, the Environmental Department for the municipality proposed a plan which includes a penalty of R$168,570 (approximately $96,000) or an agreement to donate certain items and services to the City in lieu of the penalty. The Environmental Department is also investigating alleged soil contamination from wastewater at the same store. WMS Supermercados do Brasil Ltda is cooperating with the agencies. While management cannot predict the ultimate outcome of this matter, management does not believe the outcome will have a material effect on the Companys financial condition or results of operations. Other: During fiscal 2012, the Company began conducting a voluntary internal review of its policies, procedures and internal controls pertaining to its global anti-corruption compliance program. As a result of information obtained during that review and from other sources, the Company has begun an internal investigation into whether certain matters, including permitting, licensing and inspections, were in compliance with the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. The Company has engaged outside counsel and other advisors to assist in the review of these matters and has implemented, and is continuing to implement, appropriate remedial measures. The Company has voluntarily disclosed its internal investigation to the U.S. Department of Justice and the Securities and Exchange Commission. We cannot reasonably estimate the potential liability, if any, related to these matters. However, based on the facts currently known, we do not believe that these matters will have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. ##TABLE_START ", "4": " ITEM 4.

Such information appears in the portion of the Annual Report to Shareholders that is an exhibit to this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Our common stock is primarily traded in the United States on the New York Stock Exchange. At March 22, 2012, the latest practicable date, there were 275,525 common stock shareholders of record. From time to time, the Company has repurchased shares of its common stock under a $15.0 billion share repurchase program authorized by the Board of Directors on June 3, 2010 and announced on June 4, 2010. On June 2, 2011, the Companys Board of Directors replaced that share repurchase program, which had approximately $2.1 billion of remaining authorization for share repurchases as of that date, with a new $15.0 billion share repurchase program, announced on June 3, 2011. As a result, the Company terminated and will make no further share repurchases under the program announced on June 4, 2010. Consistent with the replaced share repurchase program, the new program has no expiration date or other restriction limiting the period over which the Company can make share repurchases and will expire only when and if the Company has repurchased $15.0 billion of its shares under the newly authorized program or it earlier terminates or is replaced by a newly authorized program. Any repurchased shares are constructively retired and returned to an unissued status.

CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES ##TABLE_END Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures We maintain a system of disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to provide reasonable assurance that information, which is required to be timely disclosed, is accumulated and communicated to management in a timely fashion. In designing and evaluating such controls and procedures, we recognize that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. Our management is necessarily required to use judgment in evaluating controls and procedures. Also, we may have investments in certain unconsolidated entities. Since we do not control or manage those entities, our controls and procedures with respect to those entities are substantially more limited than those we maintain with respect to our consolidated subsidiaries. In the ordinary course of business, we review our system of internal control over financial reporting and make changes to our systems and processes to improve such controls and increase efficiency, while ensuring that we maintain an effective internal control environment. Changes may include such activities as implementing new, more efficient systems and automating manual processes. In fiscal 2010, we began implementing a new financial system in stages and, to date, have completed implementations in Argentina, Canada, Japan, Mexico, the United Kingdom and the United States. The new financial system is a significant component of our internal control over financial reporting. We will continue to implement our new financial system in stages, and each implementation may become a significant component of our internal control over financial reporting. An evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures was performed as of the end of the period covered by this report. This evaluation was performed under the supervision and with the participation of management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer. Based upon that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are effective to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files or submits under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, is accumulated and communicated to management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure and are effective to provide reasonable assurance that such information is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified by the SECs rules and forms.

BUSINESS ##TABLE_ENDGeneral Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. (\"Walmart,\" the \"Company\" or \"we\") operates retail stores in various formats under 69 banners around the world and is committed to saving people money so they can live better. We earn the trust of our customers every day by providing a broad assortment of quality merchandise and services at everyday low prices (\"EDLP\") while fostering a culture that rewards and embraces mutual respect, integrity and diversity. EDLP is our pricing philosophy under which we price items at a low price every day so our customers trust that our prices will not change under frequent promotional activity. Our fiscal year ends on January 31 for our United States (\"U.S.\") and Canadian operations. We consolidate all other operations generally using a one-month lag and on a calendar basis. Our discussion includes the accounts of Walmart and its subsidiaries as of and for the fiscal years ended January 31, 2013 (\"fiscal 2013\"), January 31, 2012 (\"fiscal 2012\") and January 31, 2011 (\"fiscal 2011\"). During fiscal 2013, we generated total revenues of $469.2 billion, which included net sales of $466.1 billion . Our operations comprise three reportable business segments: Walmart U.S., Walmart International and Sam's Club. Currently, Walmart U.S. is the largest segment of our business, accounting for approximately 59% of our fiscal 2013 net sales, and operates retail stores in various formats in all 50 states in the U.S. and Puerto Rico, as well as its online retail operations, walmart.com. Walmart International consists of retail operations in 26 countries and generated approximately 29% of our fiscal 2013 net sales. The Walmart International segment includes numerous formats of retail stores, restaurants, wholesale clubs, including Sam's Clubs, and various retail websites that operate outside the U.S. Sam's Club consists of membership warehouse clubs operated in 47 states in the U.S. and Puerto Rico, as well as the segment's online retail operations, samsclub.com. The Sam's Club segment accounted for approximately 12% of our fiscal 2013 net sales. We maintain our principal offices at 702 S.W. 8th Street, Bentonville, Arkansas 72716, USA. The Development of Our Company Although Walmart was incorporated in Delaware in October 1969, the businesses conducted by our founders began in 1945 when Sam M. Walton opened a franchise Ben Franklin variety store in Newport, Arkansas. In 1946, his brother, James L. Walton, opened a similar store in Versailles, Missouri. Until 1962, our founders' business was devoted entirely to the operation of variety stores. In that year, the first Wal-Mart Discount City, which was a discount store, opened in Rogers, Arkansas. In 1984, we opened our first three Sam's Clubs, and in 1988, we opened our first supercenter. In 1999, we opened our first Neighborhood Market. In 1992, we began our first international initiative when we entered into a joint venture in Mexico. Since then, our international presence has continued to expand and at January 31, 2013 , our Walmart International segment conducted retail business in 26 countries. Our Business Segments The Company is engaged in the operation of retail stores located throughout the U.S.; its wholly-owned subsidiaries in Argentina, Brazil, Canada, China, Japan and the United Kingdom; its majority-owned subsidiaries in Africa, Central America, Chile, China and Mexico; its joint ventures in India and China; and other controlled subsidiaries in China. The Company defines its reportable segments as those business units whose operating results the chief operating decision maker (\"CODM\") regularly reviews to analyze performance and allocate resources. The Walmart U.S. segment includes the Company's mass merchant concept in the U.S., operating under the \"Walmart\" or \"Wal-Mart\" brand, as well as walmart.com. The Walmart International segment consists of the Company's operations outside of the U.S., including various retail websites. The Sam's Club segment includes the warehouse membership clubs in the U.S., as well as samsclub.com. The Company measures the results of its segments using, among other measures, each segment's operating income, which we calculate by including certain corporate overhead allocations. From time to time, we revise the measurement of each segment's operating income, including any corporate overhead allocations, as dictated by the information regularly reviewed by our CODM. When we do so, the prior period amounts for segment operating income are reclassified to conform to the current period's presentation. 4 Walmart U.S. Segment The Walmart U.S. segment had net sales of $274.5 billion , $264.2 billion and $260.3 billion for fiscal 2013 , 2012 and 2011 , respectively. During the most recent fiscal year, no single unit accounted for as much as 1% of total Company net sales. General. As a mass merchandiser of consumer products, the Walmart U.S. segment operates retail stores in all 50 states and Puerto Rico, with supercenters in 48 states and Puerto Rico, discount stores in 44 states and Puerto Rico and Neighborhood Markets and other small store formats in 25 states and Puerto Rico. Supercenters range in size from 70,000 square feet to 260,000 square feet, with an average size of approximately 181,000 square feet. Discount stores range in size from 30,000 square feet to 219,000 square feet, with an average size of approximately 105,000 square feet.

Historically, its highest sales volume and segment operating income occur in the fiscal quarter ending January 31. Competition. The Walmart U.S. segment competes with a variety of local, national and global chains in the supermarket, discount, grocery, department, dollar, drug, variety and specialty stores, supercenter-type stores, hypermarkets, internet-based retailers and catalog businesses. We also compete with others for desirable sites for new retail units. Our ability to develop, open and operate units at the right locations and offer value and service to our customers largely determines our competitive position within the retail industry. We employ many programs designed to meet competitive pressures within our industry. These programs include the following: ##TABLE_START  EDLP  our commitment to price leadership and our pricing philosophy under which we price items at a low price every day so our customers trust that our prices will not change under frequent promotional activity; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Rollbacks  our commitment to continually pass cost savings on to the customer by lowering prices on selected goods; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Save Even More / Ad Match  a strategy to meet or be below a competitor's advertised price; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Store of the Community  a program to ensure the merchandise assortment in a particular store fits the demographic needs of the local community in which that store is located; and ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Clean, Fast and Friendly  our commitment to deliver a great customer experience through fast, friendly service in a clean environment. ##TABLE_END We offer a broad assortment of merchandise that provides one-stop shopping, in-stock levels that give our customers confidence that we will have the products they need and operating hours that allow customers to shop at their convenience. Distribution. During fiscal 2013 , approximately 81% of the Walmart U.S. segment's purchases of merchandise were shipped through our distribution facilities, which are located strategically throughout the U.S. The balance of merchandise purchased was shipped directly from suppliers. General merchandise is transported primarily through our private truck fleet. However, we contract with common carriers to transport the majority of our perishable and dry grocery merchandise. Our Walmart U.S. segment operations are supported by 133 distribution facilities, including return facilities, as of January 31, 2013 . Of these 133 facilities, we owned and operated 104. We owned and third parties operated two facilities, and we leased and operated one facility. Third parties owned and operated the remaining 26 facilities. In addition to servicing the Walmart U.S. segment, some of our Walmart distribution facilities also service our Sam's Club segment for certain items. 7 Walmart International Segment The Walmart International segment's net sales for fiscal 2013 , 2012 and 2011 , were $135.2 billion , $125.9 billion and $109.2 billion , respectively.

Retail units in India are franchised and are owned and operated by Bharti Retail. ##TABLE_END 9 Merchandise. The merchandising strategy for the Walmart International segment is similar to that of our operations in the United States in terms of the breadth and scope of merchandise offered for sale. While brand name merchandise accounts for a majority of sales, numerous store brands not offered for sale in the U.S. stores and clubs have been developed to serve customers in the different markets in which the Walmart International segment operates. In addition, steps have been taken to develop relationships with local suppliers in each country to ensure reliable sources of quality merchandise. Operations. The hours of operation for operating units in the Walmart International segment vary by country and by individual markets within countries, depending upon local and national ordinances governing hours of operation. We accept a variety of payment methods including cash, check, debit and credit cards, private-label store credit cards issued by third-party providers, and in Canada, Chile and Mexico, credit cards issued by our subsidiaries. Limited consumer finance programs exist in certain markets to facilitate the purchase of goods by the customer. Across the Walmart International segment, we are leveraging best practices, lessons from multiple store formats and global sourcing practices. Seasonal Aspects of Operations. The Walmart International segment's business is seasonal to a certain extent. Historically, the segment's highest sales volume and operating income occur in our fiscal quarter ending January 31. The seasonality of the business varies by country due to different national and religious holidays, festivals and customs, as well as different climates. Competition. The Walmart International segment competes with a variety of local, national and global chains in the supermarket, discount, grocery, department, drug, variety and specialty stores, supercenter-type stores, hypermarkets, wholesale clubs, internet-based retailers and catalog businesses in each of the countries in which we operate. We also operate restaurant chains and, on a limited basis, consumer finance operations. We compete with others for desirable sites for new retail units. Our ability to offer our customers low prices on quality merchandise determines, to a large extent, our competitive position in the countries in which Walmart International operates. EDLP is the right business model for our customers and for all of our markets, including high-growth or emerging markets. We are in the midst of a multi-year plan to transition all of our markets to EDLP. Additionally, our ability to operate food departments effectively has a significant impact on our competitive position in the markets where we operate. Distribution. We utilize a total of 160 distribution facilities located in Argentina, Brazil, Canada, Central America, Chile, China, India, Japan, Mexico, South Africa and the United Kingdom, including one export consolidation facility in the U.S. Through these facilities, we process and distribute both imported and domestic products to the operating units of the Walmart International segment. During fiscal 2013 , approximately 82% of the Walmart International segment's purchases passed through these distribution facilities. Suppliers ship the balance of the Walmart International segment's purchases directly to our stores in the various countries in which we operate. Of these 160 distribution facilities, we owned and operated 41, we owned and third parties operated 11, and we leased and operated 67. Third parties leased and operated the remaining 41 distribution facilities. 10 Sam's Club Segment The Sam's Club segment had net sales of $56.4 billion , $53.8 billion and $49.5 billion for fiscal 2013 , 2012 and 2011 , respectively. During the most recent fiscal year, no single club location accounted for as much as 1% of total Company net sales. General. Sam's Clubs are membership only operations. Members include both business owners and individual consumers. Individual consumers are referred to as Advantage Members. The annual membership fee for an individual Advantage Member is $40 for the primary membership card, with a spouse/household card available at no additional cost. The annual membership fee for Business Members is $35 for the primary membership card, with a spouse/household card available at no additional cost. In addition, Business Members can add up to eight business associates to their business account for $35 each. Sam's Club Plus is a premium membership program that offers additional benefits and services to both Business and Advantage Members. The annual fee for a Business or Advantage Plus Member is $100. In addition, Business Plus Members can add up to 16 business associates to their business membership for $35 each. Taxes, if applicable, are added to all membership fees. As a membership club warehouse, Sam's Club facility sizes generally range between 71,000 and 190,000 square feet, with an average size of approximately 133,000 square feet. Sam's Club also provides its members with a broad assortment of merchandise and services online at www.samsclub.com .

In addition, our pharmacy and optical departments accept payments for products and services through our members' health benefit plans. Seasonal Aspects of Operations. The Sam's Club segment's business is seasonal to a certain extent due to different calendar events, national and religious holidays, as well as different climates. Historically, its highest sales volume and segment operating income occur in the fiscal quarter ending January 31. Competition. Sam's Club competes with other warehouse clubs, as well as with discount retailers, retail and wholesale grocers, general merchandise wholesalers and distributors, gasoline stations, internet-based retailers and catalog businesses. Sam's Club also competes with other retailers and warehouse clubs for desirable new club sites. Our ability to offer low prices and quality merchandise and food products to meet the needs of our members largely determines our competitive position in the warehouse club industry. Distribution. During fiscal 2013 , approximately 64% of the Sam's Club segment's non-fuel purchases were shipped from the Sam's Club segment's dedicated distribution facilities or from some of the Walmart U.S. segment's distribution facilities. Suppliers shipped the balance of the Sam's Club segment's purchases directly to Sam's Club locations. As of January 31, 2013 , our Sam's Club segment operations were supported by 25 distribution facilities located strategically throughout the continental United States. Of these 25 distribution facilities, we owned and operated eight. We owned and a third party operated two facilities. Third parties owned and operated the remaining 15 distribution facilities. Additionally, some of the Walmart U.S. distribution facilities also service our Sam's Club segment for certain items. The principal focus of our Sam's Club's distribution operations is on cross-docking merchandise, while stored inventory is minimized. Cross-docking is a distribution process under which shipments are directly transferred from inbound to outbound trailers. Shipments typically spend less than 24 hours in a cross-dock facility, and sometimes less than an hour. Sam's Club uses a combination of our private truck fleet, as well as common carriers, to transport non-perishable merchandise from distribution facilities to clubs. We contract with common carriers to transport perishable grocery merchandise from distribution facilities to clubs. 13 Other Segment Information Certain financial information relating to our segments is included in our Annual Report to Shareholders for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2013 (\"Annual Report to Shareholders\") under the caption \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\" and in Note 14 in the \"Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\" included therein, which information is incorporated herein by reference.

RISK FACTORS ##TABLE_ENDThe risks described below could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. These risks are not the only risks that we face. Our business operations could also be affected by additional factors that apply to all companies operating in the U.S. and globally, as well as other risks that are not presently known to us or that we currently consider to be immaterial to our operations. General or macro-economic factors, both domestically and internationally, may adversely affect our financial performance. General economic conditions, globally or in one or more of the markets we serve, may adversely affect our financial performance. In the U.S., higher interest rates, higher fuel and other energy costs, weakness in the housing market, inflation, deflation, increased costs of essential services, such as medical care and utilities, higher levels of unemployment, decreases in consumer disposable income, unavailability of consumer credit, higher consumer debt levels, fluctuations in currency exchange rates, higher tax rates, imposition of new taxes and surcharges, other changes in tax laws, other regulatory changes, overall economic slowdown and other economic factors could adversely affect consumer demand for the products and services we sell through our Walmart U.S. segment and Sam's Club segment, change the mix of products we sell to one with a lower average gross margin, cause a slowdown in discretionary purchases of goods and result in slower inventory turnover and greater markdowns on inventory. Higher levels of unemployment, inflation, deflation, decreases in consumer disposable income, changes in tax and other laws, higher fuel and other energy costs, weakness in the local housing market, fluctuations in currency exchange rates, currency devaluations and other adverse developments in the economies of the other countries in which we operate may adversely affect consumer demand for our merchandise in those countries, especially those countries in which average incomes are significantly lower than average incomes in the U.S. These conditions may adversely affect our gross margins, cost of sales, inventory turnover and markdowns or otherwise adversely affect our operations and operating results in our Walmart International segment. Higher interest rates, higher fuel and other energy costs, transportation costs, inflation, higher costs of labor, insurance and healthcare, foreign exchange rate fluctuations, higher tax rates and other changes in tax laws, changes in healthcare laws, the imposition of measures that create barriers to or increase the costs associated with international trade, changes in other laws and regulations and other economic factors in the U.S. and other countries in which we have operations can increase our cost of sales and operating, selling, general and administrative expenses, and otherwise adversely affect our domestic and international operations and our operating results. The economic factors that affect our operations also affect the operations and economic viability of our suppliers from whom we purchase goods, a factor that can result in an increase in the cost to us of the goods we sell to our customers or, in more extreme cases, could result in certain suppliers not producing goods in the volume typically available to us for sale. We may face impediments to our expansion in the U.S., including conversions of discount stores into supercenters and opening other store formats, which may adversely affect our financial performance. Our expansion strategy depends upon our ability to execute our retail concepts successfully in new markets within the U.S. and upon our ability to increase the number of stores in markets in which we currently have operations. Our ability to open additional supercenters, discount stores, Neighborhood Markets, other store formats, and Sam's Clubs and to convert existing discount stores into supercenters depends in large measure upon our ability to locate, hire and retain qualified personnel and to acquire new store sites on acceptable terms. Local land use and other regulations restricting the construction of buildings of the type in which we operate our various formats, as well as local community action opposed to the location of specific stores at specific sites and the adoption of certain local laws restricting our operations, may affect our ability to open new stores and clubs, to convert discount stores into supercenters or to relocate or expand existing units in certain cities and states. Increased real estate, construction and development costs could limit our growth opportunities and our ability to convert our discount stores into supercenters. If we are unable to open new supercenters, discount stores, Neighborhood Markets, other small formats or Sam's Clubs or continue to convert discount stores into supercenters, our financial performance, such as net sales and operating income growth, could be adversely affected. In addition, if consumers in the markets into which we expand are not receptive to our retail concepts or are otherwise not receptive to our presence in a market, our financial performance could be adversely affected. 17 Impediments to the expansion of our Walmart International operations could adversely affect our financial performance. Our business strategy for our Walmart International segment includes expansion by selective acquisitions and strategic alliances that add new stores and markets to our existing Walmart International business, as well as opening new units in the countries in which we have existing operations. In the countries in which we have existing operations, new units may be opened in the formats already existing in those countries or may be opened in newly introduced formats, such as supercenters or Sam's Clubs, not previously operated in those markets. As in the U.S., our ability to open new stores or to expand or relocate existing stores in a market served by our Walmart International segment depends in large measure upon our ability to locate, hire and retain qualified personnel and our ability to acquire new store sites on acceptable terms. Local laws can affect our ability to acquire attractive pre-existing buildings in which to locate units or sites on which to build new units or to expand existing units. In addition, access to local suppliers of certain types of goods may limit our ability to add new units or to expand product selections in existing units in certain markets, especially in those markets in which consumers desire to purchase locally produced goods. Moreover, cultural differences in some markets into which we expand or into which we introduce new retail concepts may result in the consumers in those markets not being as receptive to our retail concepts as we anticipate those consumers will be and may make an effective response to such issues more difficult to achieve. If we do not effectively execute our expansion plans for our Walmart International segment, our financial performance could be adversely affected. We may be unable to continue to identify suitable acquisition candidates at acceptable prices and may not be successful in completing the acquisition of any such candidate identified. Although we ultimately believe we will be able to successfully integrate any newly acquired operations into our existing operations, no certainty exists that future acquisitions or alliances will be successfully integrated into our operations or can be successfully integrated in a reasonable time. Our failure to identify appropriate candidates for acquisition or alliance or to integrate effectively future acquisitions and alliances into our existing operations could adversely affect the growth of our Walmart International segment and our future financial performance. Our failure to attract and retain qualified associates, changes in laws and other labor issues could adversely affect our financial performance. Our ability to continue to expand our operations depends on our ability to attract and retain a large and growing number of qualified associates. Our ability to meet our labor needs, including our ability to find qualified personnel to fill positions that become vacant at our existing stores, clubs and distribution centers, while controlling our associate wage and related labor costs, is generally subject to numerous external factors, including the availability of a sufficient number of qualified persons in the work force of the markets in which we are located, unemployment levels within those markets, prevailing wage rates, changing demographics, health and other insurance costs and adoption of new or revised employment and labor laws and regulations. If we are unable to locate, to attract or to retain qualified personnel, if our costs of labor or related costs increase significantly or if new or revised labor laws, rules or regulations or healthcare laws are adopted or implemented, our financial performance could be adversely affected. 18 We face strong competition from other retailers and wholesale club operators, which could adversely affect our financial performance. The retail business is highly competitive. Each of our business segments competes for customers, employees, store sites, products and services and in other important aspects of its business with many other local, regional and national retailers. Our Walmart U.S. segment competes with retailers operating discount, department, drug, dollar, variety and specialty stores, supermarkets, supercenter-type stores and hypermarkets, as well as internet-based retailers and catalog businesses. Our Sam's Club segment competes with other wholesale club operators, as well as discount retailers, retail and wholesale grocers and general merchandise wholesalers and distributors, gasoline stations, as well as internet-based retailers, wholesalers and catalog businesses. Internationally, we compete with retailers who operate department, drug, dollar stores, variety and specialty stores, supermarkets, supercenter-type stores, hypermarkets, wholesale clubs, internet-based retailers and catalog businesses. Such retailers and wholesale club operators compete in a variety of ways, including merchandise selection and availability, services offered to customers, location, store hours, in-store amenities and price. Where necessary to compete effectively with competitors who price merchandise at points lower than the prices we set under our EDLP philosophy, we will lower our prices on goods for sale. Our ability to respond effectively to competitive pressures and changes in the retail markets could adversely affect our financial performance. See \"Item 1. Business\" above for additional discussion of our competitive situation in our various operating segments. Although the retail industry as a whole is highly fragmented, certain segments of the retail industry may undergo consolidation from time to time, which could result in increased competition and significantly alter the dynamics of the retail marketplace. Such consolidation may result in competitors with greatly improved financial resources, improved access to merchandise, greater market penetration than they previously enjoyed and other improvements in their competitive positions. Such business combinations could result in the provision of a wider variety of products and services at competitive prices by such consolidated companies, which could adversely affect our financial performance. Risks associated with the suppliers from whom our products are sourced and the safety of those products could adversely affect our financial performance. The products we sell are sourced from a wide variety of domestic and international suppliers. Global sourcing of many of the products we sell is an important factor in our financial performance. All of our suppliers must comply with applicable laws, including labor, safety and environmental laws, and otherwise be certified as meeting our required supplier standards of conduct. Our ability to find qualified suppliers who meet our standards, and to access products in a timely and efficient manner is a significant challenge, especially with respect to suppliers located and goods sourced outside the U.S. Political and economic instability in the countries in which foreign suppliers are located, the financial instability of suppliers, suppliers' failure to meet our supplier standards, labor problems experienced by our suppliers, the availability of raw materials to suppliers, merchandise quality issues, currency exchange rates, transport availability and cost, transport security, inflation and other factors relating to the suppliers and the countries in which they are located are beyond our control. In addition, the U.S.'s foreign trade policies, tariffs and other impositions on imported goods, trade sanctions imposed on certain countries, the limitation on the importation of certain types of goods or of goods containing certain materials from other countries and other factors relating to foreign trade are beyond our control. These and other factors affecting our suppliers and our access to products could adversely affect our financial performance. Our customers count on us to provide them with safe products. Concerns regarding the safety of food and non-food products that we source from our suppliers and then sell could cause customers to avoid purchasing certain products from us, or to seek alternative sources of supply for all of their food and non-food needs, even if the basis for the concern is outside of our control. Any lost confidence on the part of our customers would be difficult and costly to reestablish. As such, any issue regarding the safety of any food and non-food items we sell, regardless of the cause, could adversely affect our financial performance. 19 Our Walmart International operations subject us to risks associated with the legislative, judicial, accounting, regulatory, political and economic risks and conditions specific to the countries or regions in which we operate, which could adversely affect our business or financial performance. We are currently engaged in the operation of retail through our wholly-owned subsidiaries in Argentina, Brazil, Canada, China, Japan and the United Kingdom; our majority-owned subsidiaries in Africa, Central America, Chile, China and Mexico; our joint ventures in India and China; and other controlled subsidiaries in China. During fiscal 2013 , our Walmart International operations generated approximately 29% of our consolidated net sales. As a result of our expansion activities in countries outside the U.S., we expect that our Walmart International operations could account for a larger portion of our net sales in future years. Our future operating results in these countries or in other countries or regions throughout the world could be negatively affected by a variety of factors, most of which are beyond our control. These factors include political conditions, including political instability, economic conditions, legal and regulatory constraints, anti-money laundering laws and regulations, trade policies, currency regulations, and other matters in any of the countries or regions in which we operate, now or in the future. Foreign currency exchange rates and fluctuations may have an impact on our future costs or on future cash flows from our Walmart International operations, and could adversely affect our financial performance. Moreover, the economies of some of the countries in which we have operations have in the past suffered from high rates of inflation and currency devaluations, which, if they occurred again, could adversely affect our financial performance. Other factors which may impact our Walmart International operations include foreign trade, monetary and fiscal policies both of the U.S. and of other countries, laws, regulations and other activities of foreign governments, agencies and similar organizations, and risks associated with having numerous facilities located in countries which have historically been less stable than the U.S. Additional risks inherent in our Walmart International operations generally include, among others, the costs and difficulties of managing international operations, adverse tax consequences and greater difficulty in enforcing intellectual property rights in countries other than the U.S. The various risks inherent in doing business in the U.S. generally also exist when doing business outside of the U.S., and may be exaggerated by the difficulty of doing business in numerous sovereign jurisdictions due to differences in culture, laws and regulations. In foreign countries in which we have operations, a risk exists that our associates, contractors or agents could, in contravention of our policies, engage in business practices prohibited by U.S. laws and regulations applicable to us, such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the laws and regulations of other countries such as the UK Bribery Act. We maintain policies prohibiting such business practices and have in place enhanced global anti-corruption compliance programs designed to ensure compliance with these laws and regulations. Nevertheless, we remain subject to the risk that one or more of our associates, contractors or agents, including those based in or from countries where practices that violate such U.S. laws and regulations or the laws and regulations of other countries may be customary, will engage in business practices that are prohibited by our policies, circumvent our compliance programs and, by doing so, violate such laws and regulations. Any such violations, even if prohibited by our internal policies, could adversely affect our business or financial performance. Natural disasters, changes in climate, and geo-political events could adversely affect our financial performance. The occurrence of one or more natural disasters, such as hurricanes, cyclones, typhoons, tropical storms, floods, earthquakes, tsunamis, weather conditions such as major or extended winter storms, droughts and tornadoes, whether as a result of climate change or otherwise, severe changes in climate and geo-political events, such as civil unrest or terrorist attacks in a country in which we operate or in which our suppliers are located could adversely affect our operations and financial performance. Such events could result in physical damage to, or the complete loss of, one or more of our properties, the closure of one or more stores, clubs and distribution facilities, the lack of an adequate work force in a market, the inability of customers and our associates to reach or have transportation to our stores and clubs directly affected by such events, the evacuation of the populace from areas in which our stores, clubs and distribution facilities are located, changes in the purchasing patterns of consumers and in consumers' disposable income, the temporary or long-term disruption in the supply of products from some local and overseas suppliers, the disruption in the transport of goods from overseas, the disruption or delay in the delivery of goods to our distribution facilities or stores within a country in which we are operating, the reduction in the availability of products in our stores, the disruption of utility services to our stores and our facilities, and disruption in our communications with our stores. These events and their impacts could otherwise disrupt and adversely affect our operations in the areas in which these types of events occur, such as the March 2011 earthquake and tsunami in Japan or Superstorm Sandy in the U.S. in 2012, and could adversely affect our financial performance. In light of the substantial premiums payable for insurance coverage for losses caused by certain natural disasters, such as hurricanes, cyclones, typhoons, tropical storms, earthquakes, floods and tsunamis in the current insurance market, as well as the limitations on available coverage for such losses, we have chosen to be primarily self-insured with respect to such losses. Although we maintain certain specific coverages for losses from physical damages in excess of certain amounts to guard against catastrophic losses suffered from such causes, we still bear the risk of losses that would be incurred as a result of any physical damage to, or the destruction of, any stores, clubs and distribution facilities, loss or spoilage of inventory, and business interruption caused by any such events below catastrophic levels of coverage, as well as in the event of a catastrophe, in excess of the aggregate limits of applicable coverages. 20 We are subject to certain legal proceedings that may adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. We are involved in a number of legal proceedings, which include consumer, employment, tort and other litigation. Certain of these lawsuits, if decided adversely to us or settled by us, may result in liability material to our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. We are currently a defendant in numerous cases containing class-action allegations in which the plaintiffs have brought claims under federal and state wage and hour laws. In addition, we are a defendant in Dukes v. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. , which was commenced as a class-action lawsuit in June 2001 in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California, asserting that the Company had engaged in a pattern and practice of discriminating against women in promotions, pay, training, and job assignments, and seeking, among other things, injunctive relief, front pay, back pay, punitive damages, and attorneys' fees. On June 21, 2004, the U.S. district court issued an order granting in part and denying in part the plaintiffs' motion for class certification. As defined by the U.S. district court, the class included \"[a]ll women employed at any Wal-Mart domestic retail store at any time since December 26, 1998, who have been or may be subjected to Wal-Mart's challenged pay and management track promotions policies and practices.\" The Company appealed the order to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals and subsequently to the U.S. Supreme Court. On June 20, 2011, the Supreme Court issued an opinion decertifying the class and remanding the case to the district court. On October 27, 2011, the plaintiffs' attorneys filed an amended complaint proposing a class of current and former female associates at the Company's California retail facilities, and the Company filed a motion to dismiss on January 13, 2012. On September 21, 2012, the court denied the motion. On October 28, 2011 , the attorneys for the plaintiffs in the Dukes case filed a similar complaint in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Texas entitled Odle v. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. , proposing a class of current and former female associates employed in any Walmart region that includes stores located in the state of Texas. On October 15, 2012, the court in the Odle case granted the Company's motion to dismiss, dismissing with prejudice the plaintiffs' class-action allegations and the individual claims of the lead plaintiff, Stephanie Odle. On October 2, 2012, the plaintiffs' attorneys filed another similar complaint in the United States District Court for the Middle District of Tennessee entitled Phipps v. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc ., proposing a class of current and former female associates employed in \"Region 43, centered in Middle and Western Tennessee.\" On February 20, 2013, the court in the Phipps case granted the Company's motion to dismiss, and dismissed the plaintiffs' class action allegations with prejudice. On October 4, 2012, the plaintiffs' attorneys filed another similar complaint in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Florida, entitled Love v. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc ., proposing a class of current and former female associates employed in certain designated stores and clubs in regions centered in the state of Florida. On October 25, 2012, the Company filed a motion to dismiss the Florida complaint. Finally, on February 20, 2013, the plaintiffs' attorneys filed another similar complaint in the United States District Court for the Western District of Wisconsin, entitled Ladik v. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. , proposing a class of current and former female associates employed in \"Region 14, which includes Wal-Mart retail stores located in parts of Wisconsin, Illinois, Indiana and Michigan.\" On March 15, 2013, the Company filed its motion to dismiss the Wisconsin complaint. We discuss these cases and other litigation to which we are party in greater detail below under the caption \"Item 3. Legal Proceedings\" and in Note 10 to our Consolidated Financial Statements, which are part of our Annual Report to Shareholders, which are incorporated by reference in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and are included as an exhibit to this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 21 We could be subject to liability, penalties and other sanctions and other adverse consequences arising out of our on-going FCPA matter. The Audit Committee of our Board of Directors, which is composed solely of independent directors, is conducting an internal investigation into, among other things, alleged violations of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (\"FCPA\") and other alleged crimes or misconduct in connection with certain of our foreign subsidiaries, including Wal-Mart de Mxico, S.A.B. de C.V., or Walmex, and whether we appropriately handled prior allegations of such violations and/or misconduct. We are also conducting a voluntary global review of our policies, practices and internal controls for FCPA compliance and strengthening our global anti-corruption compliance programs. Since the implementation of the global review and enhanced anti-corruption compliance programs, the Audit Committee and we have identified or been made aware of additional allegations regarding potential violations of the FCPA. Inquiries or investigations regarding allegations of potential FCPA violations have been commenced in a number of foreign markets in which we operate, including, but not limited to, Brazil, China and India. In November 2011, we voluntarily disclosed our investigative activity to the U.S. Department of Justice (the \"DOJ\") and the SEC, and we have been informed by the DOJ and the SEC that we are the subject of their respective investigations into possible violations of the FCPA. A number of federal and local government agencies in Mexico have also initiated investigations of these matters. Furthermore, lawsuits relating to the matters under investigation have been filed by several of our shareholders against us, certain of our current and former directors and officers and certain of Walmex's current and former officers. We could be exposed to a variety of negative consequences as a result of these matters. One or more enforcement actions could be instituted in respect of the matters that are the subject of some or all of the on-going government investigations, and such actions, if brought, may result in judgments, settlements, fines, penalties, injunctions, cease and desist orders, debarment or other relief, criminal convictions and/or penalties. The existing and any additional shareholder lawsuits may result in judgments against us and our current and former directors and officers named in those proceedings. We cannot predict at this time the outcome or impact of the government investigations, the shareholder lawsuits, or our own internal investigations and review. Moreover, we expect to continue to incur costs (in addition to the $157 million of costs incurred in fiscal 2013) in conducting our on-going review and investigations and in responding to requests for information or subpoenas seeking documents, testimony and other information in connection with the government investigations and in defending the existing and any additional shareholder lawsuits and any governmental proceedings that are instituted against us or any of our current or former officers. These matters may require the involvement of certain members of our senior management that could impinge on the time they have available to devote to other matters relating to our business. We also expect that there will be ongoing media and governmental interest, including additional news articles from media publications on these matters that could impact the perception of our role as a corporate citizen among certain audiences. Our process of assessing and responding to the governmental investigations and the shareholder lawsuits continues. While we believe that it is probable that we will incur a loss from these matters, given the on-going nature and complexity of the review, inquiries and investigations, we cannot reasonably estimate any loss or range of loss that may arise from these matters. Although we do not presently believe that these matters will have a material adverse effect on our business, given the inherent uncertainties in such situations, we can provide no assurance that these matters will not be material to our business in the future. If the technology-based systems that give our customers the ability to shop with us online do not function effectively, our operating results, as well as our ability to grow our Global eCommerce business, could be adversely affected. Many of our customers shop with us over our merchandising websites, including walmart.com and samsclub.com, which are a part of our multi-channel sales strategy. Increasingly, customers are using computers, tablets, and smart phones to shop online with us and with our competitors and to do comparison shopping. In addition, we offer a \"site-to-store\" program under which many products available for purchase online can be shipped to and picked up by the customer at his or her local Walmart store or Sam's Club, which provides additional customer traffic at such stores and clubs. Any failure on our part to provide the necessary technological interfaces with our merchandising programs, including user friendly software applications for smart phones and tablets, could place us at a competitive disadvantage, result in the loss of online and other sales, harm our reputation with customers, have an adverse impact on the growth of our Global eCommerce business and negatively affect our results of operations. 22 Any failure to maintain the security of the information relating to our customers, associates and vendors that we hold, whether as a result of cybersecurity attacks or otherwise, could damage our reputation with customers, associates and vendors, could cause us to incur substantial additional costs and to become subject to litigation, and could adversely affect our operating results. As do most retailers, we receive certain personal information about our customers, and we also receive personal information concerning our associates and vendors. In addition, our online operations at www.walmart.com , www.samsclub.com and other websites depend upon the secure transmission of confidential information over public networks, including information permitting cashless payments. Each year, computer hackers make numerous attempts to access the information stored in our information systems. We maintain substantial security measures to protect, and to prevent unauthorized access to, such information. As a result of those measures, the past attempts by computer hackers to gain access to the information stored on our information systems have been unsuccessful. Nevertheless, it is possible that computer hackers and others (through cyberattacks, which are rapidly evolving and becoming increasingly sophisticated, or by other means) might defeat our security measures in the future and obtain the personal information of customers, associates and vendors that we hold. Such an occurrence could adversely affect our reputation with our customers, associates, and vendors, as well as our operations, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity, and could result in litigation against us or the imposition of penalties. Moreover, a security breach could require that we expend significant additional resources to upgrade further the security measures that we employ to guard such important personal information against cyberattacks and other attempts to access such information and could result in a disruption of our operations, particularly our online sales operations. We rely extensively on computer systems to process transactions, summarize results and manage our business. Disruptions in both our primary and secondary (back-up) systems could harm our ability to run our business. Although we have independent, redundant and physically separate primary and secondary computer systems, given the number of individual transactions we have each year, it is critical that we maintain uninterrupted operation of our business-critical computer systems. Our computer systems, including our back-up systems, are subject to damage or interruption from power outages, computer and telecommunications failures, computer viruses, security breaches (through cyberattacks from computer hackers and sophisticated organizations), catastrophic events such as fires, tornadoes, earthquakes and hurricanes, and usage errors by our associates. If our computer systems and our back-up systems are damaged, breached or cease to function properly, we may have to make a significant investment to repair or replace them, and we may suffer interruptions in our operations in the interim. Any material interruption in both of our computer systems and back-up systems may have a material adverse effect on our business or results of operations. In addition, we are pursuing complex initiatives to transform our information technology processes and systems, which will include, for many of our computer systems, establishing common processes across our lines of business. The risk of system disruption is increased when significant system changes are undertaken, although we believe that our change management process will mitigate this risk. If we fail to integrate our computer systems and processes, we may fail to realize the cost savings anticipated to be derived from these initiatives. We may not timely identify or effectively respond to consumer trends, which could negatively affect our relationship with our customers, the demand for our products and services, and our market share. It is difficult to predict consistently and successfully the products and services our customers will demand. The success of our business depends in part on our ability to identify and respond to evolving trends in demographics and consumer preferences. Failure to timely identify or effectively respond to changing consumer tastes, preferences and spending patterns could negatively affect our relationship with our customers, the demand for our products and services and our market share. ##TABLE_START ", "1B": " ITEM 1B.

Lauderdale Div., 10/4/12; Ladik v. Wal-Mart , USDC, Western Dist. of WI, 2/20/13. II. CERTAIN OTHER PROCEEDINGS: The Company is a defendant in several lawsuits in which the complaints closely track the allegations set forth in a news story that appeared in the New York Times ( the  \" Times \" ) on April 21, 2012. One of these is a securities lawsuit that was filed on May 7, 2012, in the United States District Court for the Middle District of Tennessee, and subsequently transferred to the Western District of Arkansas, in which the plaintiff alleges various violations of the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (the \"FCPA\") beginning in 2005, and asserts violations of Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, relating to certain prior disclosures of the Company. The plaintiff seeks to represent a class of shareholders who purchased or acquired stock of the Company between December 8, 2011, and April 20, 2012, and seeks damages and other relief based on allegations that the defendants' conduct affected the value of such stock. In addition, a number of derivative complaints have been filed in Delaware and Arkansas, also tracking the allegations of the Times story, and naming various current and former officers and directors as additional defendants. The plaintiffs in the derivative suits (in which the Company is a nominal defendant) allege, among other things, that the defendants who are or were directors or officers of the Company breached their fiduciary duties in connection with oversight of FCPA compliance. Most, but not all, of the derivative suits have been combined into two consolidated proceedings, one of which is currently pending in the Western District of Arkansas and the other in Delaware Court of Chancery. Management does not believe any possible loss or the range of any possible loss that may be incurred in connection with these proceedings will be material to the Company's financial condition or results of operations.

ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS: Item 103 of SEC Regulation S-K requires disclosure of certain environmental matters. The following matters are disclosed in accordance with that requirement. On November 8, 2005, the Company received a grand jury subpoena from the United States Attorney's Office for the Central District of California, seeking documents and information relating to the Company's receipt, transportation, handling, identification, recycling, treatment, storage and disposal of certain merchandise that constitutes hazardous materials or hazardous waste. The Company has been informed by the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Central District of California that it is a target of a criminal investigation into potential violations of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (the \"RCRA\"), the Clean Water Act and the Hazardous Materials Transportation Statute. This U.S. Attorney's Office contends, among other things, that the use of Company trucks to transport certain returned merchandise from the Company's stores to its return centers is prohibited by RCRA because those materials may be considered hazardous waste. The government alleges that, to comply with RCRA, the Company must ship from the store certain materials as \"hazardous waste\" directly to a certified disposal facility using a certified hazardous waste carrier. The U.S. Attorney's Office in the Northern District of California and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (the \"EPA\") subsequently joined in this investigation. The Company contends that the practice of transporting returned merchandise to its return centers for subsequent disposition, including disposal by certified facilities, is compliant with applicable laws and regulations. Management does not believe any possible loss or the range of any possible loss that may be incurred in connection with this matter will be material to the Company's financial condition or results of operations. On March 28, 2008, the Company received a Notice of Violation from the Missouri Department of Natural Resources (the \"Department\") alleging various violations of Missouri hazardous waste laws and regulations in connection with the activities of a third-party contractor with whom the Company had contracted for recycling services. The Department alleged that the Company provided certain items to the contractor for recycling that should have been managed as hazardous waste. As reported previously, the Company has resolved these issues with the Department. However, the EPA also has inspected the contractor's facilities, and both the EPA and the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Western District of Missouri are now conducting investigations. The Company is cooperating with these authorities. Management does not believe any possible loss or the range of any possible loss that may be incurred in connection with this matter will be material to the Company's financial condition or results of operations. In January 2011, the Environmental Department of Porto Alegre Municipality formally notified WMS Supermercados do Brasil Ltda, a subsidiary of the Company, of soil inspection reports indicating soil contamination due to leakage of oil from power generating equipment at nine store locations in Brazil. WMS Supermercados do Brasil Ltda is cooperating with the agency as well as the District Attorney's Office for the State of Rio Grande do Sul and has filed a mitigation plan to address the situation. Management does not believe any possible loss or the range of any possible loss that may be incurred in connection with this matter will be material to the Company's financial condition or results of operations. In July 2011, the Environmental Department of Bento Gonalves Municipality notified WMS Supermercados do Brasil Ltda that it is investigating alleged soil contamination from wastewater at a store. WMS Supermercados do Brasil Ltda is cooperating with the agency and monitoring the affected area. Management does not believe any possible loss or the range of any possible loss that may be incurred in connection with this matter will be material to the Company's financial condition or results of operations. On September 24, 2012, the Office of the District Attorney for Riverside County, California, notified the Company that it had identified potential violations of California laws regarding electronic monitors used in conjunction with underground storage tanks at a Sam's Club fuel station. The Company is cooperating with the County's investigation. Management does not believe any possible loss or the range of any possible loss that may be incurred in connection with this matter will be material to the Company's financial condition or results of operations. ##TABLE_START ", "4": " ITEM 4.

CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES ##TABLE_ENDEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures We maintain a system of disclosure controls and procedures that is designed to provide reasonable assurance that information, which is required to be timely disclosed, is accumulated and communicated to management in a timely fashion. In designing and evaluating such controls and procedures, we recognize that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. Our management is necessarily required to use judgment in evaluating controls and procedures. Also, we may have investments in certain unconsolidated entities. Since we do not control or manage those entities, our controls and procedures with respect to those entities are substantially more limited than those we maintain with respect to our consolidated subsidiaries. In the ordinary course of business, we review our system of internal control over financial reporting and make changes to our systems and processes to improve such controls and increase efficiency, while ensuring that we maintain an effective internal control environment. Changes may include such activities as implementing new, more efficient systems and automating manual processes. We are currently implementing a new financial system in stages and, to date, have completed implementations in Argentina, Canada, Japan, Mexico, the United Kingdom and the United States. The new financial system is a significant component of our internal control over financial reporting. We will continue to implement our new financial system in stages, and each implementation may become a significant component of our internal control over financial reporting. Additionally, during the fiscal year ended January 31, 2013, we began establishing shared service functions and processes on a global scale. The implementation of our global shared services is in the beginning stages, and we believe the related changes to processes and internal controls will allow us to be more efficient and further enhance our internal control over financial reporting. An evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures was performed as of the end of the period covered by this report. This evaluation was performed under the supervision and with the participation of management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer. The evaluation is accumulated and communicated to management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Based upon that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are effective to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files or submits under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and are effective to provide reasonable assurance that such information is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified by the SEC's rules and forms. Reports on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting Management's report on internal control over financial reporting and the attestation report of Ernst  Young LLP, the Company's independent registered public accounting firm, on the Company's internal control over financial reporting are incorporated herein by reference to all information under the captions \"Management's Report to Our Shareholders\" and \"Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting,\" respectively, included in our Annual Report to Shareholders. Such information is included in an exhibit to this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting Except for the ongoing implementation of the financial system and global shared services functions noted above, there has been no change in the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of January 31, 2013 , that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company's internal control over financial reporting. ##TABLE_START ", "9B": " ITEM 9B.

BUSINESS ##TABLE_ENDGeneral Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. (\"Walmart,\" the \"Company\" or \"we\") helps people around the world save money and live better  anytime and anywhere  in retail stores, online, and through their mobile devices. We earn the trust of our customers every day by providing a broad assortment of quality merchandise and services at everyday low prices (\"EDLP\"), while fostering a culture that rewards and embraces mutual respect, integrity and diversity. EDLP is our pricing philosophy under which we price items at a low price every day so our customers trust that our prices will not change under frequent promotional activity. Our operations comprise three reportable business segments: Walmart U.S., Walmart International and Sam's Club. Our fiscal year ends on January 31 for our United States (\"U.S.\") and Canadian operations. We consolidate all other operations generally using a one-month lag and on a calendar basis. Our discussion is as of and for the fiscal years ended January 31, 2014 (\"fiscal 2014\"), January 31, 2013 (\"fiscal 2013\") and January 31, 2012 (\"fiscal 2012\"). During fiscal 2014, we generated total revenues of $ 476 billion , which was primarily comprised of net sales of $473 billion . Walmart U.S. is our largest segment and operates retail stores in various formats in all 50 states in the U.S., Washington D.C. and Puerto Rico, as well as its online retail operations, walmart.com. Walmart U.S. generated approximately 59% of our net sales in fiscal 2014 and, of our three segments, historically has had the highest gross profit as a percentage of net sales (\"gross profit rate\"), and contributed the greatest amount to the Company's net sales and operating income. Walmart International consists of the Company's operations in 26 countries outside of the U.S. and its operations include numerous formats of retail stores, wholesale clubs, including Sam's Clubs, restaurants, banks and various retail websites. Walmart International generated approximately 29% of our fiscal 2014 net sales. The overall gross profit rate for Walmart International is lower than that of Walmart U.S. because of the margin impact from its merchandise mix. Walmart International has generally been our most rapidly growing segment, growing primarily through new stores and acquisitions and, in recent years, has been growing its net sales and operating income at a faster rate than our other segments. However, for fiscal 2014, Walmart International sales growth slowed due to fluctuations in currency exchange rates, as well as no significant acquisitions, and operating income declined as a result of certain operating expenses. Sam's Club consists of warehouse membership clubs and operates in 48 states in the U.S. and in Puerto Rico, as well as its online operations, samsclub.com. Sam's Club accounted for approximately 12% of our fiscal 2014 net sales. Sam's Club operates as a warehouse membership club with a lower gross profit rate and lower operating expenses as a percentage of net sales than our other segments. We maintain our principal offices at 702 S.W. 8th Street, Bentonville, Arkansas 72716, USA. The Development of Our Company Although Walmart was incorporated in Delaware in October 1969, the businesses conducted by our founders began in 1945 when Sam M. Walton opened a franchise Ben Franklin variety store in Newport, Arkansas. In 1946, his brother, James L. Walton, opened a similar store in Versailles, Missouri. Until 1962, our founders' business was devoted entirely to the operation of variety stores. In that year, the first Wal-Mart Discount City, which was a discount store, opened in Rogers, Arkansas. In 1984, we opened our first three Sam's Clubs, and in 1988, we opened our first supercenter. In 1999, we opened our first Neighborhood Market. In 1992, we began our first international initiative when we entered into a joint venture in Mexico. Since then, our international presence has continued to expand and at January 31, 2014 , our Walmart International segment conducted business in 26 countries. 5 Information About Our Segments The Company is engaged in the operation of: retail stores and membership clubs located throughout the U.S.; its wholly-owned subsidiaries in Argentina, Brazil, Canada, China, India, Japan and the United Kingdom; its majority-owned subsidiaries in Africa, Central America, Chile, China and Mexico; and its joint ventures and other controlled subsidiaries in China. The Company defines its reportable segments as those operations whose results the chief operating decision maker (\"CODM\") regularly reviews to analyze performance and allocate resources. The Walmart U.S. segment includes the Company's mass merchant concept in the U.S. operating under the \"Walmart\" or \"Wal-Mart\" brands, as well as walmart.com. The Walmart International segment consists of the Company's operations outside of the U.S., including various retail websites. The Sam's Club segment includes the warehouse membership clubs in the U.S., as well as samsclub.com. Corporate and support consists of corporate overhead and other items not allocated to any of our segments. The Company measures the results of its segments using, among other measures, each segment's net sales and operating income, which includes certain corporate overhead allocations. From time to time, we revise the measurement of each segment's operating income, including any corporate overhead allocations, as determined by the information regularly reviewed by our CODM. When the measurement of a segment changes, previous period amounts and balances are reclassified to be comparable to the current period's presentation. Walmart U.S. Segment The Walmart U.S. segment had net sales of $279.4 billion , $274.4 billion and $264.2 billion for fiscal 2014 , 2013 and 2012 , respectively. During the most recent fiscal year, no single unit accounted for as much as 1% of total Company net sales. General. As a mass merchandiser of consumer products, the Walmart U.S. segment operates retail stores in all 50 states, Washington D.C. and Puerto Rico, with supercenters in 48 states, Washington D.C. and Puerto Rico, discount stores in 43 states and Puerto Rico and Neighborhood Markets and other small store formats in 31 states and Puerto Rico.

These services total less than 1% of annual net sales. Nationally advertised merchandise represents a significant portion of the merchandise sold in the Walmart U.S. segment. We also market lines of merchandise under our private-label store brands, including: \"Equate,\" \"Everstart,\" \"Faded Glory,\" \"George,\" \"Great Value,\" \"Hometrends,\" \"Mainstays,\" \"Marketside,\" \"No Boundaries,\" \"Ol' Roy,\" \"Ozark Trail,\" \"Parent's Choice,\" \"Price First,\" \"Prima Della,\" \"Sam's Choice,\" \"Spring Valley\" and \"White Stag.\" The Company also markets lines of merchandise under licensed brands, some of which include: \"Better Homes  Gardens,\" \"Danskin Now,\" \"Disney,\" \"General Electric,\" \"OP,\" \"Rival\" and \"Starter.\" The percentage of net sales for the Walmart U.S. segment, including online sales, represented by each strategic merchandise unit was as follows for fiscal 2014, 2013 and 2012: ##TABLE_START   Fiscal Years Ended January 31, STRATEGIC MERCHANDISE UNITS    Grocery  56%  55%  55% Entertainment  11%  11%  12% Health and wellness  10%  11%  11% Hardlines  9%  9%  9% Apparel  7%  7%  7% Home  7%  7%  6% Total  100%  100%  100% ##TABLE_ENDPeriodically, we make revisions to the categorization of the components comprising our strategic merchandise units. When revisions are made, we also adjust the previous period's presentation to maintain comparability. Operations. Hours of operation for nearly all supercenters, and an increasing number of discount stores and Neighborhood Markets, are 24 hours each day. Hours of operation for the remaining supercenters, discount stores, Neighborhood Markets and other small store formats vary by location, but are generally 7:00 a.m. to 10:00 or 11:00 p.m., seven days a week. We accept a variety of payment methods including cash, check, debit and credit cards, electronic benefits transfer cards, a private-label store credit card issued by a third-party provider and online payments through PayPal. In addition, our pharmacy and optical departments accept payments for products and services through our customers' health benefit plans. Seasonal Aspects of Operations. The Walmart U.S. segment's business is seasonal to a certain extent due to different calendar events and national and religious holidays, as well as different weather patterns. Historically, its highest sales volume and segment operating income have occurred in the fiscal quarter ending January 31. 7 Competition. The Walmart U.S. segment competes with a variety of local, national and global chains in the supermarket, discount, grocery, department, dollar, drug, variety and specialty stores, supercenter-type stores, hypermarkets, internet-based retailers and catalog businesses. We also compete with others for desirable sites for new or relocated retail units. Our ability to develop, open and operate units at the right locations and offer value and service to our customers largely determines our competitive position within the retail industry. We employ many programs designed to meet competitive pressures within our industry. These programs include the following: ##TABLE_START  EDLP: our commitment to price leadership and our pricing philosophy under which we price items at a low price every day so our customers trust that our prices will not change under frequent promotional activity; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Rollbacks: our commitment to continually pass cost savings on to the customer by lowering prices on selected goods; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Save Even More and Ad Match: strategies to meet or be below a competitor's advertised price; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Store of the Community: a program to ensure the merchandise assortment in a particular store fits the demographic needs of the local community in which that store is located; and ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Clean, Fast and Friendly: our commitment to deliver a great customer experience through fast, friendly service in a clean environment. ##TABLE_END We offer a broad assortment of merchandise that provides one-stop shopping, in-stock levels that give our customers confidence that we will have the products they need and operating hours that allow customers to shop at their convenience. Distribution. For fiscal 2014 , approximately 80% of the Walmart U.S. segment's purchases of merchandise were shipped through our distribution facilities, which are located strategically throughout the U.S. The remaining merchandise we purchased was shipped directly from suppliers. General merchandise is transported primarily through our private truck fleet. However, we contract with common carriers to transport the majority of our perishable and dry grocery merchandise. Our Walmart U.S. segment operations are supported by 132 distribution facilities, including return facilities and e-commerce fulfillment centers, as of January 31, 2014 . Of these 132 facilities, we owned and operated 102. We owned and third parties operated two facilities, and we leased and operated three facilities. Third parties owned and operated the remaining 25 facilities. In addition to servicing the Walmart U.S. segment, some of our Walmart distribution facilities also service our Sam's Club segment for certain items. 8 Walmart International Segment The Walmart International segment's net sales for fiscal 2014 , 2013 and 2012 , were $136.5 billion , $134.7 billion and $125.4 billion , respectively.

The Company has entered into an agreement to sell the operations of the Vips restaurant business, subject to regulatory approval. ##TABLE_END Merchandise. The merchandising strategy for the Walmart International segment is similar to that of our operations in the U.S. in terms of the breadth and scope of merchandise offered for sale. While brand name merchandise accounts for a majority of sales, numerous store brands not offered for sale in the U.S. stores and clubs have been developed to serve customers in the different markets in which the Walmart International segment operates. In addition, steps have been taken to develop relationships with local suppliers in each country to ensure reliable sources of quality merchandise. Operations. The hours of operation for operating units in the Walmart International segment vary by country and by individual markets within countries, depending upon local and national ordinances governing hours of operation. We accept a variety of payment methods including cash, check, debit and credit cards, private-label store credit cards issued by third-party providers and credit cards issued by our subsidiaries in Canada, Chile and Mexico. Limited consumer finance programs exist in certain markets to facilitate the purchase of goods by the customer. Across the Walmart International segment, we are leveraging our best practices, lessons from multiple store formats and global sourcing practices. Seasonal Aspects of Operations. The Walmart International segment's business is seasonal to a certain extent. Historically, the segment's highest sales volume and operating income have occurred in the fourth quarter of our fiscal year. The seasonality of the business varies by country due to different national and religious holidays, festivals and customs, as well as different weather patterns. Competition. The Walmart International segment competes with a variety of local, national and global chains in the supermarket, discount, grocery, department, drug, variety and specialty stores, supercenter-type stores, hypermarkets, wholesale clubs, internet-based retailers and catalog businesses in each of the countries in which we operate. We also operate some restaurants and, on a limited basis, consumer finance operations. We compete with others for desirable sites for new retail units. Our ability to offer our customers low prices on quality merchandise determines, to a large extent, our competitive position in the countries in which Walmart International operates. We believe EDLP is the right business model for our customers and for all of our markets and we are in the midst of a multi-year plan to transition all of our markets to EDLP. Additionally, our ability to operate food departments effectively has a significant impact on our competitive position in the markets where we operate. Distribution. We utilize a total of 151 distribution facilities located in Argentina, Brazil, Canada, Central America, Chile, China, Japan, Mexico, South Africa and the United Kingdom. Through these facilities, we process and distribute both imported and domestic products to the operating units of the Walmart International segment. During fiscal 2014 , approximately 80% of the Walmart International segment's purchases passed through these distribution facilities. Suppliers ship the balance of the Walmart International segment's purchases directly to our stores in the various countries in which we operate. Of these 151 distribution facilities, we owned and operated 42 , we owned and third parties operated 11 , and we leased and operated 62 . Third parties leased and operated the remaining 36 distribution facilities. 10 Sam's Club Segment The Sam's Club segment had net sales of $57.2 billion , $56.4 billion and $53.8 billion for fiscal 2014 , 2013 and 2012 , respectively. During the most recent fiscal year, no single club location accounted for as much as 1% of total Company net sales. General. Sam's Clubs are membership only operations. Members include both business owners and individual consumers. Individual consumers are referred to as Savings Members (formerly Advantage Members). The annual membership fee for an individual Savings Member is $45 for the primary membership card, with a spouse/household card available at no additional cost. The annual membership fee for Business Members is $45 for the primary membership card, with a spouse/household card available at no additional cost. In addition, Business Members can add up to eight business associates to their business account for $45 each. Sam's Club Plus is a premium membership program that offers additional benefits and services to both Business and Savings Members. The annual fee for a Business or Savings Plus Member (formerly Advantage Plus Members) is $100. In addition, Business Plus Members can add up to 16 business associates to their business membership for $45 each. Taxes, if applicable, are added to all membership fees. As a membership club warehouse, Sam's Club facility sizes generally range between 71,000 and 190,000 square feet, with an average size of approximately 134,000 square feet. Sam's Club also provides its members with a broad assortment of merchandise and services online at www.samsclub.com.

Operating hours for Sam's Clubs are Monday through Friday from 10:00 a.m. to 8:30 p.m., Saturday from 9:00 a.m. to 8:30 p.m. and Sunday from 10:00 a.m. to 6:00 p.m. Additionally, all club locations offer Business Members and Plus Members the ability to shop before the regular operating hours Monday through Saturday, starting at 7:00 a.m. A variety of payment methods are accepted at our clubs, including cash, check, debit cards, certain types of credit cards and private label and co-branded Discover credit cards, issued by a third-party provider. In addition, our pharmacy and optical departments accept payments for products and services through our members' health benefit plans. Seasonal Aspects of Operations. The Sam's Club segment's business is seasonal to a certain extent due to different calendar events and national and religious holidays, as well as different weather patterns. Historically, its highest sales volume and segment operating income have occurred in the fiscal quarter ending January 31. Competition. Sam's Club competes with other warehouse clubs, as well as with discount retailers, retail and wholesale grocers, general merchandise wholesalers and distributors, internet-based retailers, gasoline stations and catalog businesses. Sam's Club also competes with other retailers and warehouse clubs for desirable new club sites. At Sam's Club, we provide value at members-only prices, a quality merchandise assortment, and bulk sizing to serve both our Savings and Business members. Our strategy allows us to differentiate ourselves within the warehouse club industry and the overall retail industry. Distribution. During fiscal 2014 , approximately 64% of the Sam's Club segment's non-fuel purchases were shipped from the Sam's Club segment's dedicated distribution facilities or from some of the Walmart U.S. segment's distribution facilities. Suppliers shipped the balance of the Sam's Club segment's purchases directly to Sam's Club locations. As of January 31, 2014 , our Sam's Club segment operations were supported by 23 distribution facilities located strategically throughout the continental United States. Of these 23 distribution facilities, we owned and operated eight . Third parties owned and operated the remaining 15 distribution facilities. Additionally, some of the Walmart U.S. distribution facilities also service our Sam's Club segment for certain items. The principal focus of our Sam's Club's distribution operations is on cross-docking merchandise, while stored inventory is minimized. Cross-docking is a distribution process under which shipments are directly transferred from inbound to outbound trailers. Shipments typically spend less than 24 hours in a cross-dock facility, and sometimes less than an hour. Sam's Club uses a combination of our private truck fleet, as well as common carriers, to transport non-perishable merchandise from distribution facilities to clubs. We contract with common carriers to transport perishable grocery merchandise from distribution facilities to clubs. 12 Other Segment Information Certain financial information relating to our segments is included in our Annual Report to Shareholders for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2014 (\"Annual Report to Shareholders\") under the caption \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\" and in Note 14 in the \"Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\" included therein, which information is incorporated herein by reference.

RISK FACTORS ##TABLE_ENDThe risks described below could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. These risks are not the only risks that we face. Our business operations could also be affected by additional factors that apply to all companies operating in the U.S. and globally, as well as other risks that are not presently known to us or that we currently consider to be immaterial to our operations. General or macro-economic factors, both domestically and internationally, may adversely affect our financial performance. General economic conditions, globally or in one or more of the markets we serve, may adversely affect our financial performance. Higher interest rates, higher fuel and other energy costs, weakness in the housing market, inflation, deflation, increased costs of essential services, such as medical care and utilities, higher levels of unemployment, decreases in consumer disposable income, unavailability of consumer credit, higher consumer debt levels, changes in consumer spending and shopping patterns, fluctuations in currency exchange rates, higher tax rates, imposition of new taxes and surcharges, other changes in tax laws, other regulatory changes, overall economic slowdown and other economic factors could adversely affect consumer demand for the products and services we sell through our business, change the mix of products we sell to one with a lower average gross margin, cause a slowdown in discretionary purchases of goods and result in slower inventory turnover and greater markdowns on inventory. Higher levels of unemployment, inflation, deflation, decreases in consumer disposable income, unavailability of consumer credit, changes in consumer spending and shopping patterns, changes in tax and other laws, higher fuel and other energy costs, weakness in the local housing market, fluctuations in currency exchange rates, currency devaluations and other adverse developments in the economies of the other countries in which we operate may adversely affect consumer demand for our merchandise in those countries, especially those countries in which average incomes are significantly lower than average incomes in the U.S. These conditions may adversely affect our gross margins, cost of sales, inventory turnover and markdowns or otherwise adversely affect our operations and consolidated operating results. Higher interest rates, higher fuel and other energy costs, transportation costs, inflation, higher costs of labor, insurance and healthcare, currency exchange rate fluctuations, higher tax rates and other changes in tax laws, changes in healthcare laws, the imposition of measures that create barriers to or increase the costs associated with international trade, changes in other laws and regulations and other economic factors in the U.S. and other countries in which we have operations can increase our cost of sales and operating, selling, general and administrative expenses, and otherwise adversely affect our domestic and international operations and our operating results. The economic factors that affect our operations also affect the operations and economic viability of our suppliers from whom we purchase goods, a factor that can result in an increase in the cost to us of the goods we sell to our customers or, in more extreme cases, could result in certain suppliers not producing goods in the volume typically available to us for sale. We may not timely identify or effectively respond to consumer trends or preferences, whether involving physical retail, e-commerce retail or a combination of both retail offerings, which could negatively affect our relationship with our customers, the demand for our products and services, and our market share. It is difficult to predict consistently and successfully the products and services our customers will demand. The success of our business depends in part on how accurately we predict consumer demand, availability of merchandise, the related impact on the demand for existing products and the competitive environment, whether for customers purchasing products at our stores and clubs, through our e-commerce businesses or through the combination of both retail offerings. A critical piece of identifying consumer preferences involves price transparency, assortment of products, customer experience and convenience. These factors are of primary importance to customers and they continue to increase in importance, particularly as a result of digital tools and social media available to consumers and the choices available to consumers for purchasing products online, at physical locations or through a combination of both retail offerings. Failure to timely identify or effectively respond to changing consumer tastes, preferences (including the key factors described above) and spending patterns, whether for our physical retail offerings, e-commerce offerings or through a combination of these retail offerings, could negatively affect our relationship with our customers, the demand for our products and services and our market share. 16 We may face impediments to our expansion in the U.S., including conversions of discount stores into supercenters and opening other store formats, which may adversely affect our financial performance. Our expansion strategy in the U.S. depends upon our ability to execute our retail concepts successfully in new markets within the U.S. and upon our ability to increase the number of stores in markets in which we currently have operations. Our ability to open additional supercenters, discount stores, Neighborhood Markets, other store formats, and Sam's Clubs and to convert existing discount stores into supercenters depends in large measure upon our ability to locate, hire and retain qualified personnel and to acquire new store sites on acceptable terms. Local real estate, land use, zoning, and other regulations restricting the construction of buildings of the type in which we operate our various formats, as well as local community action opposed to the location of specific stores at specific sites and the adoption of certain local laws restricting our operations, may affect our ability to open new stores and clubs, to convert discount stores into supercenters or to relocate or expand existing units in certain cities and states. Increased real estate, construction and development costs could limit our growth opportunities and our ability to convert our discount stores into supercenters. If we are unable to open new supercenters, discount stores, Neighborhood Markets, other small formats or Sam's Clubs or continue to convert discount stores into supercenters, our financial performance, such as net sales and operating income growth, could be adversely affected. In addition, if consumers in the markets into which we expand are not receptive to our retail concepts or are otherwise not receptive to our presence in a market, our financial performance could be adversely affected. Impediments to the expansion of our Walmart International operations could adversely affect our financial performance. Our business strategy for our Walmart International segment includes expansion by selective acquisitions and strategic alliances that add new stores and markets to our existing Walmart International business, as well as opening new units in the countries in which we have existing operations. In the countries in which we have existing operations, new units may be opened in the formats already existing in those countries or may be opened in newly introduced formats, such as supercenters or Sam's Clubs, not previously operated in those markets. As in the U.S., our ability to open new stores or to expand or relocate existing stores in a market served by our Walmart International segment depends in large measure upon our ability to locate, hire and retain qualified personnel and our ability to acquire new store sites on acceptable terms. Local laws can affect our ability to acquire attractive pre-existing buildings in which to locate units or sites on which to build new units or to expand existing units. In addition, access to local suppliers of certain types of goods may limit our ability to add new units or to expand product selections in existing units in certain markets, especially in those markets in which consumers desire to purchase locally produced goods. Moreover, cultural differences in some markets into which we expand or into which we introduce new retail concepts may result in the consumers in those markets not being as receptive to our retail concepts as we anticipate those consumers will be and may make an effective response to such issues more difficult to achieve. If we do not effectively execute our expansion plans for our Walmart International segment, our financial performance could be adversely affected. We may be unable to continue to identify suitable acquisition candidates at acceptable prices and may not be successful in completing the acquisition of any such candidate identified. Although we ultimately believe we will be able to successfully integrate any newly acquired operations into our existing operations, no certainty exists that future acquisitions or alliances will be successfully integrated into our operations or can be successfully integrated in a reasonable time. Our failure to identify appropriate candidates for acquisition or alliance or to integrate effectively future acquisitions and alliances into our existing operations could adversely affect the growth of our Walmart International segment and our future financial performance. Our failure to attract and retain qualified associates, changes in laws and other labor issues could adversely affect our financial performance. Our ability to continue to expand our operations depends on our ability to attract and retain a large and growing number of qualified associates. Our ability to meet our labor needs, including our ability to find qualified personnel to fill positions that become vacant at our existing stores, clubs and distribution centers, while controlling our associate wage and related labor costs, is generally subject to numerous external factors, including the availability of a sufficient number of qualified persons in the work force of the markets in which we are located, unemployment levels within those markets, prevailing wage rates, changing demographics, health and other insurance costs and adoption of new or revised employment and labor laws and regulations. If we are unable to locate, to attract or to retain qualified personnel, if our costs of labor or related costs increase significantly or if new or revised labor laws, rules or regulations or healthcare laws are adopted or implemented, our financial performance could be adversely affected. 17 We face strong competition from other retailers and wholesale club operators (whether through physical retail, e-commerce retail or through a combination of both areas), which could adversely affect our financial performance. The retail business is highly competitive. Each of our segments competes for customers, employees, store sites, products and services and in other important aspects of its business with many other local, regional, national and global retailers. Our Walmart U.S. segment competes with retailers operating discount, department, drug, dollar, variety and specialty stores, supermarkets, supercenter-type stores and hypermarkets, as well as internet-based retailers and catalog businesses. Our Sam's Club segment competes with other wholesale club operators, as well as discount retailers, retail and wholesale grocers and general merchandise wholesalers and distributors, gasoline stations, as well as internet-based retailers, wholesalers and catalog businesses. Internationally, we compete with retailers who operate department, drug, dollar stores, variety and specialty stores, supermarkets, supercenter-type stores, hypermarkets, wholesale clubs, internet-based retailers and catalog businesses. Such retailers and wholesale club operators compete in a variety of ways, including merchandise selection and availability, services offered to customers, location, store hours, in-store amenities and price. Where necessary, to compete effectively with competitors who price merchandise at points lower than the prices we set under our EDLP philosophy, we will lower our prices on goods for sale. Our ability to respond effectively to competitive pressures and changes in the retail markets could adversely affect our financial performance. See \"Item 1. Business\" above for additional discussion of our competitive situation in each of our reportable segments. Although the retail industry as a whole is highly fragmented, certain segments of the retail industry may undergo consolidation from time to time, which could result in increased competition and significantly alter the dynamics of the retail marketplace. Such consolidation may result in competitors with greatly improved financial resources, improved access to merchandise, greater market penetration than they previously enjoyed and other improvements in their competitive positions. Such business combinations could result in the provision of a wider variety of products and services at competitive prices by such consolidated companies, which could adversely affect our financial performance. Risks associated with the suppliers from whom our products are sourced and the safety of those products could materially adversely affect our financial performance. The products we sell are sourced from a wide variety of domestic and international suppliers. Global sourcing of many of the products we sell is an important factor in our financial performance. All of our suppliers must comply with applicable laws, including labor, safety and environmental laws, and otherwise be certified as meeting our required supplier standards of conduct. Our ability to find qualified suppliers who meet our standards, and to access products in a timely and efficient manner is a significant challenge, especially with respect to suppliers located and goods sourced outside the U.S. Political and economic instability in the countries in which foreign suppliers are located, the financial instability of suppliers, suppliers' failure to meet our supplier standards, labor problems experienced by our suppliers, the availability of raw materials to suppliers, merchandise quality issues, currency exchange rates, transport availability and cost, transport security, inflation and other factors relating to the suppliers and the countries in which they are located are beyond our control. In addition, the U.S.'s foreign trade policies, tariffs and other impositions on imported goods, trade sanctions imposed on certain countries, the limitation on the importation of certain types of goods or of goods containing certain materials from other countries and other factors relating to foreign trade are beyond our control. These and other factors affecting our suppliers and our access to products could adversely affect our financial performance. Our customers count on us to provide them with safe products. Concerns regarding the safety of food and non-food products that we source from our suppliers and then sell could cause customers to avoid purchasing certain products from us, or to seek alternative sources of supply for all of their food and non-food needs, even if the basis for the concern is outside of our control. Any lost confidence on the part of our customers would be difficult and costly to reestablish. As such, any issue regarding the safety of any food and non-food items we sell, regardless of the cause, could adversely affect our financial performance. 18 Our Walmart International operations subject us to risks associated with the legislative, judicial, accounting, regulatory, political and economic risks and conditions specific to the countries or regions in which we operate, which could adversely affect our business or financial performance. We are currently engaged in the operation of retail through our wholly-owned subsidiaries operating in Argentina, Brazil, Canada, China, India, Japan and the United Kingdom; our majority-owned subsidiaries operating in Africa, Central America, Chile, China and Mexico; and our joint ventures and other controlled subsidiaries in China. During fiscal 2014 , our Walmart International operations generated approximately 29% of our consolidated net sales. As a result of our expansion activities in countries outside the U.S., we expect that our Walmart International operations could account for a larger portion of our net sales in future years. Our future operating results in these countries or in other countries or regions throughout the world could be negatively affected by a variety of factors, most of which are beyond our control. These factors include political conditions, including political instability, economic conditions, legal and regulatory constraints, anti-money laundering laws and regulations, trade policies, currency regulations, and other matters in any of the countries or regions in which we operate, now or in the future. Foreign currency exchange rates and fluctuations may have an impact on our future costs or on future cash flows from our Walmart International operations, and could adversely affect our financial performance. Moreover, the economies of some of the countries in which we have operations have in the past suffered from high rates of inflation and currency devaluations, which, if they occurred again, could adversely affect our financial performance. Other factors which may impact our Walmart International operations include foreign trade, monetary and fiscal policies both of the U.S. and of other countries, laws, regulations and other activities of foreign governments, agencies and similar organizations, and risks associated with having numerous facilities located in countries which have historically been less stable than the U.S. Additional risks inherent in our Walmart International operations generally include, among others, the costs and difficulties of managing international operations, adverse tax consequences and greater difficulty in enforcing intellectual property rights in countries other than the U.S. The various risks inherent in doing business in the U.S. generally also exist when doing business outside of the U.S., and may be exaggerated by the difficulty of doing business in numerous sovereign jurisdictions due to differences in culture, laws and regulations. In foreign countries in which we have operations, a risk exists that our associates, contractors or agents could, in contravention of our policies, engage in business practices prohibited by U.S. laws and regulations applicable to us, such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the laws and regulations of other countries such as the UK Bribery Act. We maintain policies prohibiting such business practices and have in place enhanced global anti-corruption compliance programs designed to ensure compliance with these laws and regulations. Nevertheless, we remain subject to the risk that one or more of our associates, contractors or agents, including those based in or from countries where practices that violate such U.S. laws and regulations or the laws and regulations of other countries may be customary, will engage in business practices that are prohibited by our policies, circumvent our compliance programs and, by doing so, violate such laws and regulations. Any such violations, even if prohibited by our internal policies, could adversely affect our business or financial performance. 19 Natural disasters, changes in climate, and geo-political events could adversely affect our financial performance. The occurrence of one or more natural disasters, such as hurricanes, cyclones, typhoons, tropical storms, floods, earthquakes, tsunamis, weather conditions such as major or extended winter storms, droughts and tornadoes, whether as a result of climate change or otherwise, severe changes in climate and geo-political events, such as civil unrest or terrorist attacks in a country in which we operate or in which our suppliers are located could adversely affect our operations and financial performance. Such events could result in physical damage to, or the complete loss of, one or more of our properties, the closure of one or more stores, clubs and distribution facilities, the lack of an adequate work force in a market, the inability of customers and our associates to reach or have transportation to our stores and clubs directly affected by such events, the evacuation of the populace from areas in which our stores, clubs and distribution facilities are located, changes in the purchasing patterns of consumers and in consumers' disposable income, the temporary or long-term disruption in the supply of products from some local and overseas suppliers, the disruption in the transport of goods from overseas, the disruption or delay in the delivery of goods to our distribution facilities or stores within a country in which we are operating, the reduction in the availability of products in our stores, the disruption of utility services to our stores and our facilities, and disruption in our communications with our stores. These events and their impacts could otherwise disrupt and adversely affect our operations in the areas in which these types of events occur, such as the March 2011 earthquake and tsunami in Japan, Superstorm Sandy in the U.S. in 2012, or numerous winter storm systems in the U.S. in 2013 and 2014, and could adversely affect our financial performance. In light of the substantial premiums payable for insurance coverage for losses caused by certain natural disasters, such as hurricanes, cyclones, typhoons, tropical storms, earthquakes, floods and tsunamis in the current insurance market, as well as the limitations on available coverage for such losses, we have chosen to be primarily self-insured with respect to such losses. Although we maintain certain specific coverages for losses from physical damages in excess of certain amounts to guard against catastrophic losses suffered from such causes, we still bear the risk of losses that would be incurred as a result of any physical damage to, or the destruction of, any stores, clubs and distribution facilities, loss or spoilage of inventory, and business interruption caused by any such events below catastrophic levels of coverage, as well as in the event of a catastrophe, in excess of the aggregate limits of applicable coverages. Significant losses caused by such events could materially adversely affect our financial performance. We are subject to certain legal proceedings that may adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. We are involved in a number of legal proceedings, which include consumer, employment, tort and other litigation. Certain of these lawsuits, if decided adversely to us or settled by us, may result in liability material to our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. We are currently a defendant in numerous cases containing class-action allegations in which the plaintiffs have brought claims under federal and state wage and hour laws. In addition, we are a defendant in Dukes v. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. , which was commenced as a class-action lawsuit in June 2001 in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California, asserting that the Company had engaged in a pattern and practice of discriminating against women in promotions, pay, training, and job assignments, and seeking, among other things, injunctive relief, front pay, back pay, punitive damages, and attorneys' fees. On June 21, 2004, the U.S. district court issued an order granting in part and denying in part the plaintiffs' motion for class certification. As defined by the U.S. district court, the class included \"[a]ll women employed at any Wal-Mart domestic retail store at any time since December 26, 1998, who have been or may be subjected to Wal-Mart's challenged pay and management track promotions policies and practices.\" The Company appealed the order to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals and subsequently to the United States Supreme Court. On June 20, 2011, the Supreme Court issued an opinion decertifying the class and remanding the case to the district court. On October 27, 2011, the plaintiffs' attorneys filed an amended complaint proposing a class of current and former female associates at the Company's California retail facilities, and the Company filed a motion to dismiss on January 13, 2012. On September 21, 2012, the court denied the motion. The plaintiffs filed a motion for class certification on April 15, 2013. On August 2, 2013, the court denied the motion. On August 16, 2013, the plaintiffs filed a petition for permission to appeal that ruling to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. On November 18, 2013, the Ninth Circuit denied that petition. On October 28, 2011, the attorneys for the plaintiffs in the Dukes case filed a similar complaint in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Texas entitled Odle v. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. , proposing a class of current and former female associates employed in any Walmart region that includes stores located in the state of Texas. On October 15, 2012, the court in the Odle case granted the Company's motion to dismiss, dismissing with prejudice the plaintiffs' class-action allegations and the individual claims of the lead plaintiff, Stephanie Odle. On March 19, 2013, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit denied the plaintiffs' petition for permission to appeal. On October 2, 2012, the plaintiffs' attorneys filed another similar complaint in the United States District Court for the Middle District of Tennessee entitled Phipps v. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc ., proposing a class of current and former female associates employed in \"Region 43, centered in Middle and Western Tennessee.\" On February 20, 2013, the court in the Phipps case granted the Company's motion to dismiss, dismissing with prejudice the plaintiffs' class-action allegations. On September 11, 2013, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit granted the plaintiffs' petition for permission to appeal that ruling. On October 4, 2012, the plaintiffs' attorneys filed another similar complaint in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Florida entitled Love v. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc ., proposing a class of current and former female associates employed in certain designated stores and clubs in regions centered in the state of Florida. On September 23, 2013, the court in 20 the Love case granted the Company's motion to dismiss, dismissing with prejudice the plaintiffs' class-action allegations. Finally, on February 20, 2013, the plaintiffs' attorneys filed another similar complaint in the United States District Court for the Western District of Wisconsin, entitled Ladik v. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. , proposing a class of current and former female associates employed in \"Region 14, which includes Wal-Mart retail stores located in parts of Wisconsin, Illinois, Indiana and Michigan.\" On May 24, 2013, the court in the Ladik case granted the Company's motion to dismiss, dismissing with prejudice the plaintiffs' class-action allegations. On June 13, 2013, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit denied the plaintiffs' petition for permission to appeal. We discuss these cases and other litigation to which we are party in greater detail below under the caption \"Item 3. Legal Proceedings\" and in Note 10 to our Consolidated Financial Statements, which are part of our Annual Report to Shareholders, which are incorporated by reference in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and are included as an exhibit to this Annual Report on Form 10-K. We could be subject to liability, penalties and other sanctions and other adverse consequences arising out of our on-going FCPA matter. The Audit Committee of our Board of Directors, which is composed solely of independent directors, is conducting an internal investigation into, among other things, alleged violations of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (\"FCPA\") and other alleged crimes or misconduct in connection with certain of our foreign subsidiaries, including Wal-Mart de Mxico, S.A.B. de C.V., or Walmex, and whether we appropriately handled prior allegations of such violations and/or misconduct. We are also conducting a voluntary global review of our policies, practices and internal controls for FCPA compliance and strengthening our global anti-corruption compliance programs. Since the implementation of the global review and enhanced anti-corruption compliance programs, the Audit Committee and we have identified or been made aware of additional allegations regarding potential violations of the FCPA. Inquiries or investigations regarding allegations of potential FCPA violations have been commenced in a number of foreign markets in which we operate, including, but not limited to, Brazil, China and India. In November 2011, we voluntarily disclosed our investigative activity to the U.S. Department of Justice (the \"DOJ\") and the SEC, and we have been informed by the DOJ and the SEC that we are the subject of their respective investigations into possible violations of the FCPA. A number of federal and local government agencies in Mexico have also initiated investigations of these matters. Furthermore, lawsuits relating to the matters under investigation have been filed by several of our shareholders against us, certain of our current and former directors and officers and certain of Walmex's current and former officers. We could be exposed to a variety of negative consequences as a result of these matters. One or more enforcement actions could be instituted in respect of the matters that are the subject of some or all of the on-going government investigations, and such actions, if brought, may result in judgments, settlements, fines, penalties, injunctions, cease and desist orders, debarment or other relief, criminal convictions and/or penalties. The existing and any additional shareholder lawsuits may result in judgments against us and our current and former directors and officers named in those proceedings. We cannot predict at this time the outcome or impact of the government investigations, the shareholder lawsuits, or our own internal investigations and review. Moreover, we expect to continue to incur costs (incremental to the $282 million of costs incurred in fiscal 2014) in conducting our on-going review and investigations and in responding to requests for information or subpoenas seeking documents, testimony and other information in connection with the government investigations and in defending the existing and any additional shareholder lawsuits and any governmental proceedings that are instituted against us or any of our current or former officers. These matters may require the involvement of certain members of our senior management that could impinge on the time they have available to devote to other matters relating to our business. We also expect that there will be ongoing media and governmental interest, including additional news articles from media publications on these matters that could impact the perception of our role as a corporate citizen among certain audiences. Our process of assessing and responding to the governmental investigations and the shareholder lawsuits continues. While we believe that it is probable that we will incur a loss from these matters, given the on-going nature and complexity of the review, inquiries and investigations, we cannot reasonably estimate any loss or range of loss that may arise from these matters. Although we do not presently believe that these matters will have a material adverse affect on our business, given the inherent uncertainties in such situations, we can provide no assurance that these matters will not be material to our business in the future. 21 If the technology-based systems that give our customers the ability to shop with us online do not function effectively, our operating results, as well as our ability to grow our e-commerce business globally, could be materially adversely affected. Many of our customers shop with us over our merchandising websites, including walmart.com and samsclub.com, which are a part of our multi-channel sales strategy. Increasingly, customers are using computers, tablets, and smart phones to shop online with us and with our competitors and to do comparison shopping. We are increasingly using social media to interact with our customers and as a means to enhance their shopping experience. As a part of our multi-channel sales strategy, we offer a \"site-to-store\" program under which many products available for purchase online can be shipped to and picked up by the customer at his or her local Walmart store or Sam's Club, which provides additional customer traffic at such stores and clubs. Any failure on our part to provide attractive, user-friendly online merchandising platforms that offer a wide assortment of merchandise at competitive prices and with rapid delivery options and that continually meet the changing expectations of online shoppers and developments in online merchandising and related technology could place us at a competitive disadvantage, result in the loss of online and other sales, harm our reputation with customers, have a material adverse impact on the growth of our e-commerce business globally and could have a material adverse impact on our business and results of operations. Any failure to maintain the security of the information relating to our customers, associates and vendors that we hold, whether as a result of cybersecurity attacks or otherwise, could damage our reputation with customers, associates, vendors and others, could cause us to incur substantial additional costs and to become subject to litigation, and could materially adversely affect our operating results. As do most retailers, we receive and store certain personal information about our customers in our information systems, and we receive and store personal information concerning our associates and vendors. We also utilize use third-party service providers for a variety of reasons, including, without limitation, encryption and authentication technology, content delivery to customers, back-office support, and other functions. In addition, our online operations at www.walmart.com, www.samsclub.com and other websites depend upon the secure transmission of confidential information over public networks, including information permitting cashless payments. Each year, computer hackers, cyber terrorists, and others make numerous attempts to access the information stored in our information systems. We maintain substantial security measures to protect, and to prevent unauthorized access to, such information and have security processes, protocols and standards that are applicable to our third-party service providers to protect information from our systems to which they have access to under their engagements with us. As a result of these measures and our monitoring processes and procedures, we believe that past attempts by computer hackers, cyber terrorists and others to gain access to the information stored on our information systems have been unsuccessful. Nevertheless, it is possible that computer hackers, cyber terrorists and others (through cyberattacks, which are rapidly evolving and becoming increasingly sophisticated, or by other means) might defeat our security measures or those of our third-party service providers in the future and obtain the personal information of customers, associates and vendors that we hold. Any breach of our security measures or those of our third-party service providers and loss of our confidential information, which could be undetected for a period of time, or any failure by us to comply with applicable privacy and information security laws and regulations could cause us to incur significant costs to protect any customers whose personal data was compromised and to restore customer confidence in us and to make changes to our information systems and administrative processes to address security issues and compliance with applicable laws and regulations. In addition, such events could materially adversely affect our reputation with our customers, associates, and vendors, as well as our operations, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity, and could result in litigation against us or the imposition of penalties or liabilities, which may not be covered by our insurance policies. Moreover, a security breach could require us to devote significant management resources to address the problems created by the security breach and to expend significant additional resources to upgrade further the security measures that we employ to guard such important personal information against cyberattacks and other attempts to access such information and could result in a disruption of our operations, particularly our online sales operations. As a retailer who accepts debit and credit cards for payment, we are subject to the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (\"PCI DSS\"), issued by the PCI Council. PCI DSS contains compliance guidelines and standards with regard to our security surrounding the physical and electronic storage, processing and transmission of individual cardholder data. Despite our compliance with these standards and other information security measures, we cannot be certain that all of our information technology systems are able to prevent, contain or detect any cyberattacks, cyber terrorism, or security breaches from known malware or malware that may be developed in the future. To the extent that any disruption results in the loss, damage or misappropriation of information, we may be materially adversely affected by claims from customers, financial institutions, regulatory authorities, payment card associations and others. In addition, the cost of complying with stricter privacy and information security laws and standards could be significant to us. 22 We rely extensively on information systems to process transactions, summarize results and manage our business. Disruptions in both our primary and secondary (back-up) systems could harm our ability to run our business. Although we have independent, redundant and physically separate primary and secondary information systems, given the number of individual transactions we have each year, it is critical that we maintain uninterrupted operation of our business-critical information systems. Our information systems, including our back-up systems, are subject to damage or interruption from power outages, computer and telecommunications failures, computer viruses, worms, other malicious computer programs, denial-of-service attacks, security breaches (through cyberattacks from computer hackers and sophisticated organizations), catastrophic events such as fires, tornadoes, earthquakes and hurricanes, and usage errors by our associates. If our information systems and our back-up systems are damaged, breached or cease to function properly, we may have to make a significant investment to repair or replace them, and we may suffer interruptions in our operations in the interim. Any material interruption in both our information systems and back-up systems may have a material adverse affect on our business or results of operations. In addition, we are pursuing complex initiatives to transform our information technology processes and systems, which will include, for many of our information systems, establishing common processes across our lines of business. The risk of system disruption is increased when significant system changes are undertaken, although we believe that our change management process will mitigate this risk. If we fail to integrate our information systems and processes, we may fail to realize the cost savings anticipated to be derived from these initiatives. ##TABLE_START ", "1B": " ITEM 1B.

CERTAIN OTHER PROCEEDINGS: The Company is a defendant in several lawsuits in which the complaints closely track the allegations set forth in a news story that appeared in The New York Times ( the  \" Times \" ) on April 21, 2012. One of these is a securities lawsuit that was filed on May 7, 2012, in the United States District Court for the Middle District of Tennessee, and subsequently transferred to the Western District of Arkansas, in which the plaintiff alleges various violations of the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (the \"FCPA\") beginning in 2005, and asserts violations of Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, relating to certain prior disclosures of the Company. The plaintiff seeks to represent a class of shareholders who purchased or acquired stock of the Company between December 8, 2011, and April 20, 2012, and seeks damages and other relief based on allegations that the defendants' conduct affected the value of such stock. In addition, a number of derivative complaints have been filed in Delaware and Arkansas, also tracking the allegations of the Times story, and naming various current and former officers and directors as additional defendants. The plaintiffs in the derivative suits (in which the Company is a nominal defendant) allege, among other things, that the defendants who are or were directors or officers of the Company breached their fiduciary duties in connection with oversight of FCPA compliance. Most, but not all, of the derivative suits have been combined into two consolidated proceedings, one of which is currently pending in the Western District of Arkansas and the other in the Delaware Court of Chancery. Management does not believe any possible loss or the range of any possible loss that may be incurred in connection with these proceedings will be material to the Company's financial condition or results of operations.

Delaware Derivative Litigation, Delaware Court of Chancery, 4/25/12 (consolidation of seven separately-filed suits). 25 III. ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS: Item 103 of SEC Regulation S-K requires disclosure of certain environmental matters. The following matters are disclosed in accordance with that requirement. In January 2011, the Environmental Department of Porto Alegre Municipality formally notified WMS Supermercados do Brasil Ltda (\"Walmart Brazil\"), a subsidiary of the Company, of soil inspection reports indicating soil contamination due to leakage of oil from power generating equipment at nine store locations in Brazil. Walmart Brazil is cooperating with the agency as well as the District Attorney's Office for the State of Rio Grande do Sul and has filed a mitigation plan to address the situation. Management does not believe any possible loss or the range of any possible loss that may be incurred in connection with this matter will be material to the Company's financial condition or results of operations. In July 2011, the Environmental Department of Bento Gonalves  notified Walmart Brazil that it is investigating alleged soil contamination from oil leakage, in addition to the previous wastewater issue. Walmart Brazil is cooperating with the agency and monitoring the affected area. Management does not believe any possible loss or the range of any possible loss that may be incurred in connection with this matter will be material to the Company's financial condition or results of operations. In January 2014, a division of the State Department of Sustainable Development of Santa Catarina notified Walmart Brazil that a store did not have the proper license for a wastewater treatment system. Walmart Brazil is working with the agency to resolve the issue. Management does not believe any possible loss or the range of any possible loss that may be incurred in connection with this matter will be material to the Company's financial condition or results of operations. In February 2014, a division of the Health Department of the City of Vitria notified Walmart Brazil that a wastewater leak had been observed in the parking lot of a store. Walmart Brazil immediately took steps to address the situation and is cooperating with the agency to resolve the issue. Management does not believe any possible loss or the range of any possible loss that may be incurred in connection with this matter will be material to the Company's financial condition or results of operations. In April 2013, a subsidiary of the Company, Corporacion de Compaias Agroindustriales, operating in Costa Rica, became aware that the Municipality of Curridabat is seeking a penalty of approximately $380,000 in connection with the construction of a retaining wall fifteen years ago for a perishables distribution center that is situated along a protected river bank. The subsidiary obtained permits from the Municipality and the Secretaria Tcnica Nacional Ambiental at the time of construction, but the Municipality now alleges that the wall is non-conforming. Management does not believe any possible loss or the range of any possible loss that may be incurred in connection with this matter will be material to the Company's financial condition or results of operations. In 2013, Wal-Mart de Mxico, S.A.B. de C.V. (\"Walmex\"), a subsidiary of the Company, resolved 21 enforcement actions with the Mexico Environmental Protection Agency in the State of Michoacn, Mexico, involving a variety of issues that occurred between 2008 and 2013. The issues included, but were not limited to, record-keeping allegations, such as failure to maintain appropriate records for air conditioning equipment, and the alleged failure to obtain appropriate permits, such as for the installation of ovens. Walmex agreed to pay approximately $92,000 USD into a fund set up by the state for ecological projects and to help restore a natural preservation area known as La Mintzita, in resolution of 18 of the matters, and to pay approximately $92,500 USD to resolve the remaining 3 matters . In August 2013, the Company received a notice from the California Air Resources Board (\"CARB\") alleging that two products sold by the Company have exceeded volatile organic chemical limits prescribed in its California Consumer Products Regulations.

Such information appears in the portion of the Annual Report to Shareholders that is an Exhibit 13 to this Annual Report on Form 10-K and incorporated by reference herein. Our common stock is primarily traded in the United States on the New York Stock Exchange. At March 18, 2014 , the latest practicable date, there were 255,758 common stock shareholders of record. From time to time, the Company repurchases shares of its common stock under share repurchase programs authorized by the Board of Directors. On June 6, 2013 , the Company's Board of Directors replaced the previous $15.0 billion share repurchase program, which had approximately $712 million of remaining authorization for share repurchases as of that date, with a new $15.0 billion share repurchase program, announced on June 7, 2013 . As was the case with the replaced share repurchase program, the current share repurchase program has no expiration date or other restrictions limiting the period over which the Company can make share repurchases. At January 31, 2014 , authorization for $11.3 billion of share repurchases remained under the current share repurchase program. Any repurchased shares are constructively retired and returned to an unissued status. Share repurchase activity under our share repurchase program, on a settlement date basis, for each of the three months ended January 31, 2014 , was as follows: ##TABLE_START Fiscal Period  Total Number of Shares Repurchased  Average Price Paid per Share (in dollars)  Total Number of Shares Purchased as Part of Publicly Announced Plans or Programs  Approximate Dollar Value of Shares that May Yet Be Purchased Under the Plans or Programs (in billions) November 1-30, 2013  4,937,704  $ 78.08  4,937,704  $ 11.8 December 1-31, 2013  3,105,451  79.12  3,105,451  11.6 January 1-31, 2014  3,187,282  77.11  3,187,282  11.3 Total  11,230,437    11,230,437   ##TABLE_END27 ##TABLE_START ", "6": " ITEM 6.

CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES ##TABLE_ENDEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures We maintain a system of disclosure controls and procedures that is designed to provide reasonable assurance that information, which is required to be timely disclosed, is accumulated and communicated to management in a timely fashion. In designing and evaluating such controls and procedures, we recognize that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. Our management is necessarily required to use judgment in evaluating controls and procedures. Also, we may have investments in certain unconsolidated entities. Since we do not control or manage those entities, our controls and procedures with respect to those entities are substantially more limited than those we maintain with respect to our consolidated subsidiaries. In the ordinary course of business, we review our system of internal control over financial reporting and make changes to our systems and processes to improve such controls and increase efficiency, while ensuring that we maintain an effective internal control environment. Changes may include such activities as implementing new, more efficient systems, automating manual processes and updating existing systems. For example, we are currently implementing various new financial system applications in stages across the Company. To date, we have completed significant implementations in Argentina, Canada, Central America, Japan, Mexico, the United Kingdom and the United States. As these financial system applications are implemented, they become a significant component of our internal control over financial reporting. We will continue to implement and update our financial system applications in stages, and each implementation may become a significant component of our internal control over financial reporting. Additionally, we are currently establishing shared service functions and processes on a global scale. The implementation of our global shared services is in the beginning stages, and we believe the related changes to processes and internal controls will allow us to be more efficient and further enhance our internal control over financial reporting. An evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report was performed under the supervision and with the participation of management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer. Based upon that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are effective to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files or submits under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, is accumulated and communicated to management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure and are effective to provide reasonable assurance that such information is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified by the SEC's rules and forms. Reports on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting Management's report on internal control over financial reporting and the attestation report of Ernst  Young LLP, the Company's independent registered public accounting firm, on the Company's internal control over financial reporting are incorporated herein by reference to all information under the captions \"Management's Report to Our Shareholders\" and \"Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting,\" respectively, included in our Annual Report to Shareholders. Such information is included in Exhibit 13 to this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting Except for the ongoing implementation and updating of the financial system and global shared services functions noted above, there has been no change in the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of January 31, 2014 , that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company's internal control over financial reporting. ##TABLE_START ", "9B": " ITEM 9B.

BUSINESS ##TABLE_ENDGeneral Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. (\"Walmart,\" the \"Company\" or \"we\") helps people around the world save money and live better  anytime and anywhere  in retail stores or through our e-commerce and mobile capabilities. Through innovation, we are striving to create a customer-centric experience that seamlessly integrates digital and physical shopping. Physical retail encompasses our brick and mortar presence in each market where we operate. Digital retail is comprised of our e-commerce websites and mobile commerce applications. Each week, we serve nearly 260 million customers who visit our over 11,000 stores under 72 banners in 27 countries and e-commerce websites in 11 countries. Our strategy is to lead on price, invest to differentiate on access, be competitive on assortment and deliver a great experience. Leading on price is designed to earn the trust of our customers every day by providing a broad assortment of quality merchandise and services at everyday low prices (\"EDLP\"), while fostering a culture that rewards and embraces mutual respect, integrity and diversity. EDLP is our pricing philosophy under which we price items at a low price every day so our customers trust that our prices will not change under frequent promotional activity. Price leadership is core to who we are. Everyday low cost (\"EDLC\") is our commitment to control expenses so those cost savings can be passed along to our customers. Our digital and physical presence provides customers access to our broad assortment anytime and anywhere. We strive to give our customers and members a great digital and physical shopping experience. Our operations comprise three reportable segments: Walmart U.S., Walmart International and Sam's Club. Our fiscal year ends on January 31 for our United States (\"U.S.\") and Canadian operations. We consolidate all other operations generally using a one-month lag and on a calendar basis. Our discussion is as of and for the fiscal years ended January 31, 2015 (\"fiscal 2015 \"), January 31, 2014 (\"fiscal 2014 \") and January 31, 2013 (\"fiscal 2013 \"). During fiscal 2015 , we generated total revenues of $ 485.7 billion , which was primarily comprised of net sales of $482.2 billion . We maintain our principal offices at 702 S.W. 8th Street, Bentonville, Arkansas 72716, USA. Our common stock trades on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol \"WMT.\" The Development of Our Company Although Walmart was incorporated in Delaware in October 1969, the businesses conducted by our founders began in 1945 when Sam M. Walton opened a franchise Ben Franklin variety store in Newport, Arkansas. In 1946, his brother, James L. Walton, opened a similar store in Versailles, Missouri. Until 1962, our founders' business was devoted entirely to the operation of variety stores. In that year, the first Wal-Mart Discount City, which was a discount store, opened in Rogers, Arkansas. In 1983, we opened our first three Sam's Clubs, and in 1988, we opened our first supercenter. In 1998, we opened our first Neighborhood Market. In 1991, we began our first international initiative when we entered into a joint venture in Mexico. Since then, our international presence has continued to expand and as of January 31, 2015 , our Walmart International segment conducted business in 26 countries. In 2000, we began our first digital initiative by creating the walmart.com retail website. Since then, our digital presence has continued to grow and as of January 31, 2015 , we operated e-commerce websites in 11 countries, providing access to Walmart and our various brands around the world. 7 Information About Our Segments The Company is engaged in the operation of retail, wholesale and other units located throughout the U.S., Africa, Argentina, Brazil, Canada, Central America, Chile, China, India, Japan, Mexico and the United Kingdom. The Company's operations are conducted in three reportable segments: Walmart U.S., Walmart International and Sam's Club. The Company defines its segments as those operations whose results the chief operating decision maker (\"CODM\") regularly reviews to analyze performance and allocate resources. The Company sells similar individual products and services in each of its segments. It is impractical to segregate and identify revenues for each of these individual products and services. Walmart U.S. is our largest segment and operates retail stores in all 50 states in the U.S., Washington D.C. and Puerto Rico, with three primary store formats, as well as digital retail. Walmart U.S. generated approximately 60% of our net sales in fiscal 2015 , and of our three segments, Walmart U.S. is the largest and has historically had the highest gross profit as a percentage of net sales (\"gross profit rate\"). In addition, Walmart U.S. has historically contributed the greatest amount to the Company's net sales and operating income. Walmart International consists of operations in 26 countries outside of the U.S. and includes numerous formats divided into three major categories: retail, wholesale and other. These categories consist of numerous formats, including supercenters, supermarkets, hypermarkets, warehouse clubs, including Sam's Clubs, cash  carry, home improvement, specialty electronics, restaurants, apparel stores, drug stores and convenience stores, as well as digital retail. Walmart International generated approximately 28% of our fiscal 2015 net sales. The overall gross profit rate for Walmart International is lower than that of Walmart U.S. because of its merchandise mix. Walmart International is our second largest segment and has grown through acquisitions, as well as by adding retail, wholesale and other units. Sam's Club consists of membership-only warehouse clubs and operates in 48 states in the U.S. and in Puerto Rico, as well as digital retail. Sam's Club accounted for approximately 12% of our fiscal 2015 net sales. As a membership-only warehouse club, membership income is a significant component of the segment's operating income. As a result, Sam's Club operates with a lower gross profit rate and lower operating expenses as a percentage of net sales than our other segments. The Company measures the results of its segments using, among other measures, each segment's net sales and operating income, which includes certain corporate overhead allocations. From time to time, we revise the measurement of each segment's operating income, including any corporate overhead allocations, as determined by the information regularly reviewed by our CODM. When the measurement of a segment changes, previous period amounts and balances are reclassified to be comparable to the current period's presentation. Walmart U.S. Segment The Walmart U.S. segment is a mass merchandiser of consumer products, operating under the \"Walmart\" or \"Wal-Mart\" brands, as well as walmart.com. The Walmart U.S. segment had net sales of $288.0 billion , $279.4 billion and $274.4 billion for fiscal 2015 , 2014 and 2013 , respectively. During the most recent fiscal year, no single unit accounted for as much as 1% of total Company net sales. Physical. The Walmart U.S. segment operates retail stores in the U.S., including in all 50 states, Washington D.C. and Puerto Rico, with supercenters in 49 states, Washington D.C. and Puerto Rico, discount stores in 42 states and Puerto Rico and Neighborhood Markets and other small store formats in 31 states and Puerto Rico.

Hours of operation for nearly all supercenters, and an increasing number of discount stores and Neighborhood Markets, are 24 hours each day. A variety of payment methods are accepted at our stores and through our e-commerce websites and mobile commerce applications. Seasonal Aspects of Operations. The Walmart U.S. segment's business is seasonal to a certain extent due to calendar events and national and religious holidays, as well as different weather patterns. Historically, its highest sales volume and segment operating income have occurred in the fiscal quarter ending January 31. 10 Competition. The Walmart U.S. segment competes with a variety of local, national and global chains in the supermarket, discount, grocery, department, dollar, drug, variety and specialty stores, supercenter-type stores, hypermarkets, e-commerce and catalog businesses. We also compete with others for desirable sites for new or relocated retail units. Our ability to develop, open and operate units at the right locations and to deliver a customer-centric experience that seamlessly integrates digital and physical shopping largely determines our competitive position within the retail industry. We employ many programs designed to meet competitive pressures within our industry.

The Walmart International segment operates e-commerce websites in 10 countries (Argentina, Brazil, Canada, Chile, China, India, Japan, Mexico, South Africa and the United Kingdom). Customers have access through our e-commerce websites and mobile commerce applications to a broad assortment of merchandise and services, both of which vary by country. Digital retail supports our physical stores with capabilities like \"Click  Collect\" in the United Kingdom and our grocery home delivery business in Mexico. Merchandise. The merchandising strategy for the Walmart International segment is similar to that of our operations in the U.S. in terms of the breadth and scope of merchandise offered for sale. While brand name merchandise accounts for a majority of our sales, we have both leveraged U.S. private brands and developed market specific private brands to serve our customers with high quality, lower priced items. Along with the private brands we market globally, such as \"Equate,\" \"George,\" \"Great Value,\" \"Holiday Time,\" \"Hometrends,\" \"Mainstays,\" \"Ol' Roy\" and \"Parents Choice,\" our international markets have developed market specific brands including \"Aurrera,\" \"Cambridge,\" \"Chosen by You,\" \"Extra Special\" and \"Smart Price.\" In addition, we have developed relationships with regional and local suppliers in each market to ensure reliable sources of quality merchandise that is equal to national brands at low prices. Operations. The hours of operation for operating units in the Walmart International segment vary by country and by individual markets within countries, depending upon local and national ordinances governing hours of operation. Each country accepts a variety of payment methods. Seasonal Aspects of Operations. The Walmart International segment's business is seasonal to a certain extent. Historically, the segment's highest sales volume and operating income have occurred in the fourth quarter of our fiscal year. The seasonality of the business varies by country due to different national and religious holidays, festivals and customs, as well as different weather patterns. Competition. The Walmart International segment competes with a variety of local, national and global chains in the supermarket, discount, grocery, department, drug, variety and specialty stores, hypermarkets, wholesale clubs, home improvement, specialty electronic, e-commerce and catalog businesses in each of the markets in which we operate. We also operate some restaurants and, on a limited basis, consumer finance operations. We compete with others for desirable sites. Our ability to develop, open and operate units at the right locations and to deliver a customer-centric experience that seamlessly integrates digital and physical shopping determines, to a large extent, our competitive position in the markets in which Walmart International operates. We believe EDLP is the right business model for our customers and for all of our markets and we are in the midst of a multi-year plan to transition all of our markets to EDLP. Additionally, our ability to operate food departments effectively has a significant impact on our competitive position in the markets where we operate. 13 Distribution. We utilize a total of 156 distribution facilities located in Argentina, Brazil, Canada, Central America, Chile, China, Japan, Mexico, South Africa and the United Kingdom. Through these facilities, we process and distribute both imported and domestic products to the operating units of the Walmart International segment. During fiscal 2015 , approximately 80% of the Walmart International segment's purchases passed through these distribution facilities. Suppliers ship the balance of the Walmart International segment's purchases directly to our stores in the various markets in which we operate. The following table provides further details of our international distribution facilities as of January 31, 2015 : ##TABLE_START   Owned and Operated  Owned and Third Party Operated  Leased and Operated  Leased and Third Party Operated  Total International distribution facilities  11 34 ##TABLE_END14 Sam's Club Segment The Sam's Club segment operates membership-only warehouse clubs, as well as samsclub.com, in the U.S. and had net sales of $58.0 billion , $57.2 billion and $56.4 billion for fiscal 2015 , 2014 and 2013 , respectively. During the most recent fiscal year, no single club location accounted for as much as 1% of total Company net sales. Membership.

Seasonal Aspects of Operations. The Sam's Club segment's business is seasonal to a certain extent due to calendar events and national and religious holidays, as well as different weather patterns. Historically, its highest sales volume and segment operating income have occurred in the fiscal quarter ending January 31. Competition. Sam's Club competes with other membership-only warehouse clubs, the largest of which are Costco Wholesale and BJ's Wholesale Club, as well as with discount retailers, retail and wholesale grocers, general merchandise wholesalers and distributors, gasoline stations, e-commerce and catalog businesses. Sam's Club also competes with other retailers and warehouse clubs for desirable new club sites. At Sam's Club, we provide value at members-only prices, a quality merchandise assortment, and bulk sizing to serve both our Savings and Business members. Our strategy allows us to differentiate ourselves within the membership-only warehouse club industry and the overall retail industry. Distribution. During fiscal 2015 , approximately 66% of the Sam's Club segment's non-fuel purchases were shipped from the Sam's Club segment's 24 dedicated distribution facilities located strategically throughout the U.S., or from some of the Walmart U.S. segment's distribution facilities, which service the Sam's Club segment for certain items. Suppliers shipped the balance of the Sam's Club segment's purchases directly to Sam's Club locations. The table below provides further details of our dedicated distribution facilities as of January 31, 2015 . ##TABLE_START   Owned and Operated  Owned and Third Party Operated  Leased and Operated  Leased and Third Party Operated  Total Sam's Club distribution facilities      ##TABLE_ENDThe principal focus of Sam's Club's distribution operations is on cross-docking merchandise, while stored inventory is minimized. Cross-docking is a distribution process under which shipments are directly transferred from inbound to outbound trailers. Shipments typically spend less than 24 hours in a cross-dock facility, and sometimes less than an hour. Sam's Club uses a combination of a private truck fleet, as well as common carriers, to transport non-perishable merchandise from distribution facilities to clubs. The segment contracts with common carriers to transport perishable grocery merchandise from distribution facilities to clubs. 16 Other Segment Information Certain financial information relating to our segments is included in our Annual Report to Shareholders for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2015 (\"Annual Report to Shareholders\") under the caption \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\" and in Note 14 in the \"Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\" included therein, which information is incorporated herein by reference.

Similar to other retailers, the Company has a large number of part-time, hourly or non-exempt associates and a large number of associates turn over each year. We believe our relationships with our associates are good. On February 19, 2015, the Company announced a significant initiative on pay and training for U.S. associates. Approximately 500,000 full-time and part-time associates at Walmart U.S. stores and Sam's Clubs will receive pay raises in the first half of fiscal 2016. Also included in the announcement were comprehensive changes to our hiring, training, compensation and scheduling programs, as well as to our store management structure. These changes will give our U.S. associates the opportunity to earn higher pay and advance in their careers. Certain information relating to retirement-related benefits we provide to our associates is included in our Annual Report to Shareholders in Note 12 in the \"Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\" included therein, which information is incorporated herein by reference. In addition to retirement-related benefits, in the U.S., the Company offers a broad range of Company-paid benefits to our associates, including store discount cards or Sam's Club memberships, bonuses based on Company performance, matching a portion of purchases through the Associate Stock Purchase Plan and life insurance. The Company also offers health-care benefits to eligible full-time and part-time associates in the U.S. The Company's medical plan in the U.S. has no lifetime maximum benefit for most expenses. Similarly, in the operations outside the U.S., the Company provides a variety of associate benefits that vary based on customary local practices and statutory requirements. 17 Executive Officers of the Registrant The following chart names the executive officers of the Company, each of whom is elected by and serves at the pleasure of the Board of Directors.

RISK FACTORS ##TABLE_ENDThe risks described below could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. Our business operations could also be affected by additional factors that apply to all companies operating in the U.S. and globally. Global and Domestic Economic Risks and Consumer Demand Risks General or macro-economic factors, both domestically and internationally, may materially adversely affect our financial performance. General economic conditions, globally or in one or more of the markets we serve, may adversely affect our financial performance. Higher interest rates, higher fuel and other energy costs, weakness in the housing market, inflation, deflation, increased costs of essential services, such as medical care and utilities, higher levels of unemployment, decreases in consumer disposable income, unavailability of consumer credit, higher consumer debt levels, changes in consumer spending and shopping patterns, fluctuations in currency exchange rates, higher tax rates, imposition of new taxes and surcharges, other changes in tax laws, other regulatory changes, overall economic slowdown and other economic factors could adversely affect consumer demand for the products and services we sell through our business, change the mix of products we sell to one with a lower average gross margin, cause a slowdown in discretionary purchases of goods and result in slower inventory turnover and greater markdowns on inventory. Higher levels of unemployment, inflation, deflation, decreases in consumer disposable income, unavailability of consumer credit, changes in consumer spending and shopping patterns, changes in tax and other laws, higher fuel and other energy costs, weakness in the local housing market, fluctuations in currency exchange rates, currency devaluations and other adverse developments in the economies of the other countries in which we operate may adversely affect consumer demand for our merchandise in those countries, especially those countries in which average incomes are significantly lower than average incomes in the U.S. These conditions may adversely affect our gross margins, cost of sales, inventory turnover and markdowns or otherwise adversely affect our operations and consolidated operating results. Higher interest rates, higher fuel and other energy costs, transportation costs, inflation, higher costs of labor, insurance and healthcare, currency exchange rate fluctuations, higher tax rates and other changes in tax laws, changes in healthcare laws, the imposition of measures that create barriers to or increase the costs associated with international trade, changes in other laws and regulations and other economic factors in the U.S. and other countries in which we have operations can increase our cost of sales and operating, selling, general and administrative expenses, and otherwise adversely affect our domestic and international operations and our operating results. The economic factors that affect our operations also affect the operations and economic viability of our suppliers from whom we purchase goods, a factor that can result in an increase in the cost to us of the goods we sell to our customers or, in more extreme cases, could result in certain suppliers not producing goods in the volume typically available to us for sale. We may not timely identify or effectively respond to consumer trends or preferences, whether involving physical retail, digital retail or a combination of both retail offerings, which could negatively affect our relationship with our customers, the demand for our products and services, and our market share. It is difficult to predict consistently and successfully the products and services our customers will demand. The success of our business depends in part on how accurately we predict consumer demand, availability of merchandise, the related impact on the demand for existing products and the competitive environment, whether for customers purchasing products at our stores and clubs, through our digital retail businesses or through the combination of both retail offerings. A critical piece of identifying consumer preferences involves price transparency, assortment of products, customer experience and convenience. These factors are of primary importance to customers and they continue to increase in importance, particularly as a result of digital tools and social media available to consumers and the choices available to consumers for purchasing products online, at physical locations or through a combination of both retail offerings. Failure to timely identify or effectively respond to changing consumer tastes, preferences (including the key factors described above) and spending patterns, whether for our physical retail offerings, digital retail offerings or a combination of these retail offerings, could negatively affect our relationship with our customers, the demand for our products and services and our market share. Fluctuations in foreign exchange rates may adversely affect our financial performance and our reported results of operations. Our operations in countries other than the U.S. are conducted primarily in the local currencies of those countries. Our consolidated financial statements are denominated in U.S. dollars, and to prepare those financial statements we must translate the amounts of the assets, liabilities, net sales, other revenues and expenses of our operations outside of the U.S. from local currencies into U.S. dollars using exchange rates for the current period. As a result of such translations, future fluctuations in currency exchange rate over time that are unfavorable to us may result in our consolidated financial statements reflecting significant adverse period-over-period changes in our financial performance. Such unfavorable currency exchange rate 20 fluctuations will adversely affect the reported performance of our Walmart International operating segment and have a corresponding adverse affect on our reported consolidated results of operations. We may pay for products we purchase for sale in our stores and clubs around the world with a currency other than the local currency of the country in which the goods will be sold. When we must acquire the currency to pay for such products and the exchange rates for the payment currency fluctuate in a manner unfavorable to us, our cost of goods sold may increase and we may be unable or unwilling to change the prices at which we sell those goods to address that increase in our costs. Consequently, fluctuations in currency exchange rates may adversely affect our results of operations. Capital Investment and Information Systems Risks We may face impediments to our expansion in the U.S., including conversions of discount stores into supercenters and opening other store formats, which may adversely affect our financial performance. Our expansion strategy in the U.S. depends upon our ability to execute our retail concepts successfully in new markets within the U.S. and upon our ability to increase the number of stores in markets in which we currently have operations. Our ability to open additional supercenters, discount stores, Neighborhood Markets, other store formats, and Sam's Clubs and to convert existing discount stores into supercenters depends in large measure upon our ability to locate, hire and retain qualified personnel and to acquire new store sites on acceptable terms. Local real estate, land use, zoning, and other regulations restricting the construction of buildings of the type in which we operate our various formats, as well as local community action opposed to the location of specific stores at specific sites and the adoption of certain local laws restricting our operations, may affect our ability to open new stores and clubs, to convert discount stores into supercenters or to relocate or expand existing units in certain cities and states. Increased real estate, construction and development costs could limit our growth opportunities and our ability to convert our discount stores into supercenters. If we are unable to open new supercenters, discount stores, Neighborhood Markets, other small formats or Sam's Clubs or continue to convert discount stores into supercenters, our financial performance, such as net sales and operating income growth, could be adversely affected. In addition, if consumers in the markets into which we expand are not receptive to our retail concepts or are otherwise not receptive to our presence in a market, our financial performance could be adversely affected. Impediments to the expansion of our Walmart International operations could adversely affect our financial performance. Our business strategy for our Walmart International segment includes expansion by selective acquisitions and strategic alliances that add new stores and markets to our existing Walmart International business, as well as opening new units in the countries in which we have existing operations. In the countries in which we have existing operations, new units may be opened in the formats already existing in those countries or may be opened in newly introduced formats, such as supercenters or Sam's Clubs, not previously operated in those markets. As in the U.S., our ability to open new stores or to expand or relocate existing stores in a market served by our Walmart International segment depends in large measure upon our ability to locate, hire and retain qualified personnel and our ability to acquire new store sites on acceptable terms. Local laws can affect our ability to acquire attractive pre-existing buildings in which to locate units or sites on which to build new units or to expand existing units. In addition, access to local suppliers of certain types of goods may limit our ability to add new units or to expand product selections in existing units in certain markets, especially in those markets in which consumers desire to purchase locally produced goods. Moreover, cultural differences in some markets into which we expand or into which we introduce new retail concepts may result in the consumers in those markets not being as receptive to our retail concepts as we anticipate those consumers will be and may make an effective response to such issues more difficult to achieve. If we do not effectively execute our expansion plans for our Walmart International segment, our financial performance could be adversely affected. We may be unable to continue to identify suitable acquisition candidates at acceptable prices and may not be successful in completing the acquisition of any such candidate identified. Although we ultimately believe we will be able to successfully integrate any newly acquired operations into our existing operations, no certainty exists that future acquisitions or alliances will be successfully integrated into our operations or can be successfully integrated in a reasonable time. Our failure to identify appropriate candidates for acquisition or alliance or to integrate effectively future acquisitions and alliances into our existing operations could adversely affect the growth of our Walmart International segment and our future financial performance. We rely extensively on information systems to process transactions, summarize results and manage our business. Disruptions in both our primary and secondary (back-up) systems could harm our ability to run our business. Although we have independent, redundant and physically separate primary and secondary information systems, given the number of individual transactions we have each year, it is critical that we maintain uninterrupted operation of our business-critical information systems. Our information systems, including our back-up systems, are subject to damage or interruption from power outages, computer and telecommunications failures, computer viruses, worms, other malicious computer programs, denial-of-service attacks, security breaches (through cyberattacks from computer hackers and sophisticated organizations), catastrophic events such as fires, tornadoes, earthquakes and hurricanes, and usage errors by our associates. If our information systems and our back-up systems are damaged, breached or cease to function properly, we may have to make a significant 21 investment to repair or replace them, and we may suffer interruptions in our operations in the interim. Any material interruption in both our information systems and back-up systems may have a material adverse affect on our business or results of operations. In addition, we are pursuing complex initiatives to transform our information technology processes and systems, which will include, for many of our information systems, establishing common processes across our lines of business. The risk of system disruption is increased when significant system changes are undertaken, although we believe that our change management process will mitigate this risk. If we fail to integrate our information systems and processes, we may fail to realize the cost savings anticipated to be derived from these initiatives. Competitive and Reputational Risks Our failure to attract and retain qualified associates, increases in wage and benefit costs, changes in laws and other labor issues could materially adversely affect our financial performance. Our ability to continue to expand our operations depends on our ability to attract and retain a large and growing number of qualified associates. Our ability to meet our labor needs, including our ability to find qualified personnel to fill positions that become vacant at our existing stores, clubs and distribution centers, while controlling our associate wage and related labor costs, is generally subject to numerous external factors, including the availability of a sufficient number of qualified persons in the work force of the markets in which we are located, unemployment levels within those markets, prevailing wage rates, changing demographics, health and other insurance costs and adoption of new or revised employment and labor laws and regulations. If we are unable to locate, to attract or to retain qualified personnel, the quality of service we provide to our customers may decrease and our financial performance may be adversely affected. The wage increases for over 500,000 associates in our operations in the U.S. and investment in other initiatives for our associates in the U.S. that we announced in February 2015 will increase our wage and other labor expenses significantly. If the combined impact of the increase in our gross profit and decrease in certain operating expenses in fiscal 2015 and thereafter does not offset the additional wage expense, our consolidated operating income and our consolidated income from continuing operations could be less than our consolidated operating income and consolidated income from continuing operations for recent fiscal years. In addition, if our costs of labor or related costs increase significantly for other reasons or if new or revised labor laws, rules or regulations or healthcare laws are adopted or implemented, our financial performance could be materially adversely affected. We face strong competition from other retailers and wholesale club operators (whether through physical retail, digital retail or through a combination of both areas), which could materially adversely affect our financial performance. The retail business is highly competitive. Each of our segments competes for customers, employees, store sites, products and services and in other important aspects of its business with many other local, regional, national and global retailers, as well as other national and international internet-based retailers. Our Walmart U.S. segment competes with retailers operating discount, department, drug, dollar, variety and specialty stores, supermarkets, supercenter-type stores and hypermarkets, as well as e-commerce and catalog businesses. Our Sam's Club segment competes with other wholesale club operators, as well as discount retailers, retail and wholesale grocers and general merchandise wholesalers and distributors, gasoline stations, as well as internet-based retailers, wholesalers and catalog businesses. Internationally, we compete with retailers who operate department, drug, dollar stores, variety and specialty stores, supermarkets, supercenter-type stores, hypermarkets, wholesale clubs, e-commerce and catalog businesses. Such retailers, wholesale club operators and e-commerce retailers compete in a variety of ways, including the prices at which we sell our merchandise, the merchandise selection and availability, services offered to customers, location, store hours, in-store amenities, the shopping convenience and overall shopping experience we offer, the attractiveness and ease of use of our e-commerce websites and mobile commerce applications, speed of and options for delivery to our customers of the merchandise they purchase from us online and the integration of our physical locations with our digital retail operations. Where necessary, to compete effectively with competitors who price merchandise at points lower than the prices we set under our EDLP philosophy, we will lower our prices on goods for sale. Our ability to respond effectively to competitive pressures and changes in the retail markets could materially adversely affect our financial performance. See \"Item 1. Business\" above for additional discussion of our competitive situation in each of our reportable segments. Although the retail industry as a whole is highly fragmented, certain segments of the retail industry may undergo consolidation from time to time, which could result in increased competition and significantly alter the dynamics of the retail marketplace. Such consolidation may result in competitors with greatly improved financial resources, improved access to merchandise, greater market penetration than they previously enjoyed and other improvements in their competitive positions. Such business combinations could result in the provision of a wider variety of products and services at competitive prices by such consolidated companies, which could adversely affect our financial performance. 22 If the technology-based systems that give our customers the ability to shop with us online do not function effectively, our operating results, as well as our ability to grow our e-commerce business globally, could be materially adversely affected. Many of our customers shop with us over our e-commerce websites and mobile commerce applications, including walmart.com and samsclub.com, which are a part of our multi-channel sales strategy. Increasingly, customers are using computers, tablets, and smart phones to shop online with us and with our competitors and to do comparison shopping. We are increasingly using social media to interact with our customers and as a means to enhance their shopping experience. As a part of our multi-channel sales strategy, we offer \"Walmart Pickup\" and \"Club Pickup\" programs under which many products available for purchase online can be shipped to and picked up by the customer at his or her local Walmart store or Sam's Club, which provides additional customer traffic at such stores and clubs. Multi-channel retailing is a rapidly evolving part of the retail industry and of our operations in the U.S. and in a number of markets in which our Walmart International segment operates. Any failure on our part to provide attractive, user-friendly e-commerce platforms that offer a wide assortment of merchandise at competitive prices and with rapid delivery options and that continually meet the changing expectations of online shoppers and developments in online merchandising and related technology could place us at a competitive disadvantage, result in the loss of e-commerce and other sales, harm our reputation with customers, have a material adverse impact on the growth of our e-commerce business globally and could have a material adverse impact on our business and results of operations. Data and Privacy Risks Any failure to maintain the security of the information relating to our company, customers, associates and vendors that we hold, whether as a result of cybersecurity attacks on our information systems or otherwise, could damage our reputation with customers, associates, vendors and others, could cause us to incur substantial additional costs and to become subject to litigation, and could materially adversely affect our operating results. As do most retailers, we receive and store in our digital information systems certain personal information about our customers, and we receive and store personal information concerning our associates and vendors. We also utilize third-party service providers for a variety of reasons, including, without limitation, encryption and authentication technology, content delivery to customers, back-office support, and other functions. In addition, our online operations at www.walmart.com, www.samsclub.com and our websites in certain of our foreign markets depend upon the secure transmission of confidential information over public networks, including information permitting cashless payments. Each year, computer hackers, cyber terrorists, and others make numerous attempts to access the information stored in our information systems. We maintain substantial security measures to protect, and to prevent unauthorized access to, such information and have security processes, protocols and standards that are applicable to our third-party service providers to protect information from our systems to which they have access to under their engagements with us. As a result of these measures and our monitoring processes and procedures, we believe that past attempts by computer hackers, cyber terrorists and others to gain access to the information stored on our information systems have been unsuccessful. However, we or our third-party service providers may be unable to anticipate one or more of the rapidly evolving and increasingly sophisticated means by which computer hackers, cyber terrorists and others may attempt to defeat our security measures or those of our third-party service providers and breach our or our third-party service providers information systems. Cyber threats are rapidly evolving and are becoming increasingly sophisticated. As cyber threats evolve and become more difficult to detect and successfully defend against, one or more cyber threats might defeat our security measures or those of our third-party service providers in the future and obtain the personal information of customers, associates and vendors that we hold or to which our third-party service providers have access, and we or our third-party service providers may not discover any security breach and loss of information for a significant period of time after the security breach occurs. Moreover, associate error or malfeasance, faulty password management or other irregularities may result in a defeat of our or our third-party service providers security measures and breach our or our third-party service providers information systems (whether digital or otherwise). Any breach of our security measures or those of our third-party service providers and loss of our confidential information, which could be undetected for a period of time, or any failure by us to comply with applicable privacy and information security laws and regulations could cause us to incur significant costs to protect any customers whose personal data was compromised and to restore customer confidence in us and to make changes to our information systems and administrative processes to address security issues and compliance with applicable laws and regulations. In addition, such events could materially adversely affect our reputation with our customers, associates, vendors and shareholders, as well as our operations, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity, could result in the release to the public of confidential information about our operations and financial condition and performance and could result in litigation against us or the imposition of penalties or liabilities, which may not be covered by our insurance policies. Moreover, a security breach could require us to devote significant management resources to address the problems created by the security breach and to expend significant additional resources to upgrade further the security measures that we employ to guard such important personal information against cyberattacks and other attempts to access such information and could result in a disruption of our operations, particularly our digital retail operations. 23 As a retailer who accepts debit and credit cards for payment, we are subject to the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (\"PCI DSS\"), issued by the Payment Card Industry Security Standards Council. PCI DSS contains compliance guidelines and standards with regard to our security surrounding the physical and electronic storage, processing and transmission of individual cardholder data. By accepting debit cards for payment, we are also subject to compliance with the American National Standards Institute encryption standards and payment network security operating guidelines. Even though we comply with these guidelines and standards and other information security measures, we cannot be certain that the security measures we maintain to protect all of our information technology systems are able to prevent, contain or detect any cyberattacks, cyber terrorism, or security breaches from known malware or malware that may be developed in the future. To the extent that any disruption results in the loss, damage or misappropriation of information, we may be materially adversely affected by claims from customers, financial institutions, regulatory authorities, payment card networks and others. In addition, the cost of complying with stricter privacy and information security laws and standards could be significant to us. Supply Chain and Third-Party Risks Risks associated with the suppliers from whom our products are sourced and the safety of those products could materially adversely affect our financial performance. The products we sell are sourced from a wide variety of domestic and international suppliers. Global sourcing of many of the products we sell is an important factor in our financial performance. All of our suppliers must comply with applicable laws, including labor, safety and environmental laws, and otherwise be certified as meeting our required supplier standards of conduct. Our ability to find qualified suppliers who meet our standards, and to access products in a timely and efficient manner is a significant challenge, especially with respect to suppliers located and goods sourced outside the U.S. Political and economic instability in the countries in which foreign suppliers are located, the financial instability of suppliers, suppliers' failure to meet our supplier standards (including our responsible sourcing standards), labor problems experienced by our suppliers and their manufacturers, the availability of raw materials to suppliers, merchandise safety and quality issues, disruption in the transportation of merchandise from the suppliers and manufacturers to our stores, clubs, and other facilities, including as a result of labor slowdowns at any port at which a material amount of merchandise we purchase enters into the U.S., currency exchange rates, transport availability and cost, transport security, inflation and other factors relating to the suppliers and the countries in which they are located are beyond our control. In addition, the U.S.'s foreign trade policies, tariffs and other impositions on imported goods, trade sanctions imposed on certain countries, the limitation on the importation of certain types of goods or of goods containing certain materials from other countries and other factors relating to foreign trade are beyond our control. These and other factors affecting our suppliers and our access to products could adversely affect our financial performance. Our customers count on us to provide them with safe products. Concerns regarding the safety of food and non-food products that we source from our suppliers and then sell could cause customers to avoid purchasing certain products from us, or to seek alternative sources of supply for all of their food and non-food needs, even if the basis for the concern is outside of our control. Any lost confidence on the part of our customers would be difficult and costly to reestablish. As such, any issue regarding the safety of any food and non-food items we sell, regardless of the cause, could adversely affect our financial performance. Legal, Regulatory and Other External Risks Our Walmart International operations subject us to risks associated with the legislative, judicial, accounting, regulatory, political and economic risks and conditions specific to the countries or regions in which we operate, which could adversely affect our business or financial performance. We are currently engaged in the operation of retail through our wholly-owned subsidiaries operating in Argentina, Brazil, Canada, Chile, China, India, Japan and the United Kingdom; our majority-owned subsidiaries operating in Africa, Central America, China and Mexico; and our joint ventures and other controlled subsidiaries in China. During fiscal 2015 , our Walmart International operations generated approximately 28% of our consolidated net sales. As a result of our expansion activities in countries outside the U.S., we expect that our Walmart International operations could account for a larger portion of our net sales in future years. Our future operating results in these countries or in other countries or regions throughout the world could be negatively affected by a variety of factors, most of which are beyond our control. These factors include political conditions, including political instability, local and global economic conditions, legal and regulatory constraints, tax regulations, local labor laws, anti-money laundering laws and regulations, trade policies, currency regulations, and other matters in any of the countries or regions in which we operate, now or in the future. In particular, Brazilian federal, state and local laws are complex and subject to varying interpretations. Although the Company believes it complies with those laws, the Company's subsidiaries in Brazil are party to a large number of labor claims and non-income tax assessments, which have arisen during the normal course of business in Brazil. These matters are subject to inherent uncertainties and if decided adversely to the Company, could adversely affect our financial performance. Moreover, the economies of some of the countries in which we have operations have in the past suffered from high rates of inflation and currency devaluations, which, if they occurred again, could adversely affect our financial performance. Other 24 factors which may impact our Walmart International operations include foreign trade, monetary and fiscal policies both of the U.S. and of other countries, laws, regulations and other activities of foreign governments, agencies and similar organizations, and risks associated with having numerous facilities located in countries which have historically been less stable than the U.S. Additional risks inherent in our Walmart International operations generally include, among others, the costs and difficulties of managing international operations, adverse tax consequences and greater difficulty in enforcing intellectual property rights in countries other than the U.S. The various risks inherent in doing business in the U.S. generally also exist when doing business outside of the U.S., and may be exaggerated by the difficulty of doing business in numerous sovereign jurisdictions due to differences in culture, laws and regulations. In foreign countries in which we have operations, a risk exists that our associates, contractors or agents could, in contravention of our policies, engage in business practices prohibited by U.S. laws and regulations applicable to us, such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the laws and regulations of other countries such as the UK Bribery Act. We maintain policies prohibiting such business practices and have in place enhanced global anti-corruption compliance programs designed to ensure compliance with these laws and regulations. Nevertheless, we remain subject to the risk that one or more of our associates, contractors or agents, including those based in or from countries where practices that violate such U.S. laws and regulations or the laws and regulations of other countries may be customary, will engage in business practices that are prohibited by our policies, circumvent our compliance programs and, by doing so, violate such laws and regulations. Any such violations, even if prohibited by our internal policies, could adversely affect our business or financial performance. Natural disasters, changes in climate, and geo-political events could adversely affect our financial performance. The occurrence of one or more natural disasters, such as hurricanes, cyclones, typhoons, tropical storms, floods, earthquakes, tsunamis, weather conditions such as major or extended winter storms, droughts and tornadoes, whether as a result of climate change or otherwise, severe changes in climate and geo-political events, such as civil unrest or terrorist attacks in a country in which we operate or in which our suppliers are located could adversely affect our operations and financial performance. Such events could result in physical damage to, or the complete loss of, one or more of our properties, the closure of one or more stores, clubs and distribution facilities, the lack of an adequate work force in a market, the inability of customers and our associates to reach or have transportation to our stores and clubs directly affected by such events, the evacuation of the populace from areas in which our stores, clubs and distribution facilities are located, changes in the purchasing patterns of consumers and in consumers' disposable income, the temporary or long-term disruption in the supply of products from some local and overseas suppliers, the disruption in the transport of goods from overseas, the disruption or delay in the delivery of goods to our distribution facilities or stores within a country in which we are operating, the reduction in the availability of products in our stores, the disruption of utility services to our stores and our facilities, and disruption in our communications with our stores. These events and their impacts could otherwise disrupt and adversely affect our operations in the areas in which these types of events occur, such as Superstorm Sandy in the U.S. in 2012, or numerous winter storm systems in the U.S. in 2013, 2014 and 2015, and could adversely affect our financial performance. In light of the substantial premiums payable for insurance coverage for losses caused by certain natural disasters, such as hurricanes, cyclones, typhoons, tropical storms, earthquakes, floods and tsunamis in the current insurance market, as well as the limitations on available coverage for such losses, we have chosen to be primarily self-insured with respect to such losses. Although we maintain certain specific coverages for losses from physical damages in excess of certain amounts to guard against catastrophic losses suffered from such causes, we still bear the risk of losses that would be incurred as a result of any physical damage to, or the destruction of, any stores, clubs and distribution facilities, loss or spoilage of inventory, and business interruption caused by any such events below catastrophic levels of coverage, as well as in the event of a catastrophe, in excess of the aggregate limits of applicable coverages. Significant losses caused by such events could materially adversely affect our financial performance. We are subject to certain legal proceedings that may materially adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. We are involved in a number of legal proceedings, which include consumer, employment, tort and other litigation. Certain of these lawsuits, if decided adversely to us or settled by us, may result in liability material to our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. We are currently a defendant in a number of cases containing class-action allegations in which the plaintiffs have brought claims under federal and state wage and hour laws, as well as a number of cases containing class-action allegations in which the plaintiffs have brought claims under federal and state consumer laws. In addition, ASDA Stores, Ltd. (\"ASDA\"), a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, has been named as a defendant in over 4,000 \"equal value\" claims that are pending in the Manchester Employment Tribunal (the \"Employment Tribunal\") in the United Kingdom. The claimants, who are current and former ASDA store employees, allege that the work performed by female employees in ASDA's retail stores is of equal value in terms of, among other things, the demands of their jobs to that of male employees working in ASDA's warehouses and distribution facilities, and that the disparity in pay between these different job positions is not objectively justified. The claimants are seeking: (i) back pay consisting of the difference between the wage rate paid in the stores and the rate paid in the warehouses and distribution facilities for the period of their employment up to a maximum of six years under the statute of limitations; and (ii) an increase in the store rate prospectively, to match that paid in the warehouses and the 25 distribution facilities. On January 30, 2015, the Employment Tribunal held a case management conference in order to set a schedule for addressing jurisdictional challenges and other issues involved in the first phase of the litigation. At this time, it is undetermined: (i) how many of these claims may ultimately be filed; or (ii) whether the Employment Tribunal will decide to hear each claim individually or to consolidate them into groups of similar claims and proceed with the trial of \"test cases.\" Determinations made in such test cases, if any, might be asserted as binding in subsequent trials of claims within that group and any subsequent claims involving the same issues. Moreover, a determination as to the appropriate rate of pay for a particular store position might be asserted as the basis for additional claims for back pay or wage increases by other store associates who perform, or who have performed, like work in that position. On March 23, 2015, ASDA asked the Employment Tribunal to stay all proceedings, contending that the High Court, which is the superior first instance civil court in the UK that is headquartered in the Royal Courts of Justice in the City of London, is the more convenient and appropriate forum to hear these claims. On March 23, 2015, ASDA also asked the Employment Tribunal to \"strike out\" substantially all of the claims for failing to comply with Employment Tribunal rules. We discuss this case and other litigation to which we are party in greater detail below under the caption \"Item 3. Legal Proceedings\" and in Note 10 in the \"Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements\", which are part of our Annual Report to Shareholders, which are incorporated by reference in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and are included as an exhibit to this Annual Report on Form 10-K. We could be subject to liability, penalties and other sanctions and other adverse consequences arising out of our on-going FCPA matter. The Audit Committee of our Board of Directors, which is composed solely of independent directors, is conducting an internal investigation into, among other things, alleged violations of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (\"FCPA\") and other alleged crimes or misconduct in connection with certain of our foreign subsidiaries, including Wal-Mart de Mxico, S.A.B. de C.V., or Walmex, and whether we appropriately handled prior allegations of such violations and/or misconduct. We are also conducting a voluntary global review of our policies, practices and internal controls for FCPA compliance and strengthening our global anti-corruption compliance programs. Since the implementation of the global review and enhanced anti-corruption compliance programs, the Audit Committee and we have identified or been made aware of additional allegations regarding potential violations of the FCPA. Inquiries or investigations regarding allegations of potential FCPA violations have been commenced in a number of foreign markets in which we operate, including, but not limited to, Brazil, China and India. In November 2011, we voluntarily disclosed our investigative activity to the U.S. Department of Justice (the \"DOJ\") and the SEC, and we have been informed by the DOJ and the SEC that we are the subject of their respective investigations into possible violations of the FCPA. A number of federal and local government agencies in Mexico have also initiated investigations of these matters. Furthermore, lawsuits relating to the matters under investigation have been filed by several of our shareholders against us, certain of our current and former directors and officers and certain of Walmex's current and former officers. We could be exposed to a variety of negative consequences as a result of these matters. One or more enforcement actions could be instituted in respect of the matters that are the subject of some or all of the on-going government investigations, and such actions, if brought, may result in judgments, settlements, fines, penalties, injunctions, cease and desist orders, debarment or other relief, criminal convictions and/or penalties. The existing and any additional shareholder lawsuits may result in judgments against us and our current and former directors and officers named in those proceedings. We cannot predict at this time the outcome or impact of the government investigations, the shareholder lawsuits, or our own internal investigations and review. Moreover, we expect to continue to incur costs (incremental to the $173 million of costs incurred in fiscal 2015) in conducting our on-going review and investigations and in responding to requests for information or subpoenas seeking documents, testimony and other information in connection with the government investigations and in defending the existing and any additional shareholder lawsuits and any governmental proceedings that are instituted against us or any of our current or former officers. These matters may require the involvement of certain members of our senior management that could impinge on the time they have available to devote to other matters relating to our business. We also expect that there will be ongoing media and governmental interest, including additional news articles from media publications on these matters that could impact the perception of our role as a corporate citizen among certain audiences. Our process of assessing and responding to the governmental investigations and the shareholder lawsuits continues. While we believe that it is probable that we will incur a loss from these matters, given the on-going nature and complexity of the review, inquiries and investigations, we cannot reasonably estimate any loss or range of loss that may arise from these matters. Although we do not presently believe that these matters will have a material adverse affect on our business, given the inherent uncertainties in such situations, we can provide no assurance that these matters will not be material to our business in the future. ##TABLE_START ", "1B": " ITEM 1B.

We provide the following additional information concerning those legal proceedings, including the name of the lawsuit, the court in which the lawsuit is pending, and the date on which the petition commencing the lawsuit was filed. Wage-and-Hour Class Action: Braun/Hummel v. Wal-Mart , Ct. of Common Pleas, Philadelphia County, PA, 3/20/02 and 8/30/04; Superior Ct. of PA, Eastern Dist., Philadelphia, PA, 12/7/07; Supreme Ct. of PA, Harrisburg, PA, 10/9/11. ASDA Equal Value Claims: Ms S Brierley  Others v ASDA Stores Ltd (2406372/2008  Others-Manchester Employment Tribunal). II. CERTAIN OTHER PROCEEDINGS: The Company is a defendant in several lawsuits in which the complaints closely track the allegations set forth in a news story that appeared in The New York Times ( the \" Times \" ) on April 21, 2012. One of these is a securities lawsuit that was filed on May 7, 2012, in the United States District Court for the Middle District of Tennessee, and subsequently transferred to the Western District of Arkansas, in which the plaintiff alleges various violations of the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (the \"FCPA\") beginning in 2005, and asserts violations of Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, relating to certain prior disclosures of the Company. The plaintiff seeks to represent a class of shareholders who purchased or acquired stock of the Company between December 8, 2011, and April 20, 2012, and seeks damages and other relief based on allegations that the defendants' conduct affected the value of such stock. In addition, a number of derivative complaints have been filed in Delaware and Arkansas, also tracking the allegations of the Times story, and naming various current and former officers and directors as additional defendants. The plaintiffs in the derivative suits (in which the Company is a nominal defendant) allege, among other things, that the defendants who are or were directors or officers of the Company breached their fiduciary duties in connection with oversight of FCPA compliance. All of the derivative suits have been combined into two consolidated proceedings, one of which is currently pending in the Western District of Arkansas and the other in the Delaware Court of Chancery. On March 31, 2015, the United States District Court for the Western District of Arkansas granted the defendants motion to dismiss the consolidated derivative proceedings in that court. Management does not believe any possible loss or the range of any possible loss that may be incurred in connection with these proceedings will be material to the Company's financial condition or results of operations. Securities Class Action: City of Pontiac General Employees Retirement System v. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., USDC, Western Dist. of AR, 5/7/12. Derivative Lawsuits: In re Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. Shareholder Derivative Litigation , USDC, Western Dist. of AR, 5/31/12; In re Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. Delaware Derivative Litigation, Delaware Ct. of Chancery, 4/25/12. 28 III. ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS: Item 103 of SEC Regulation S-K requires disclosure of certain environmental matters. The following matters are disclosed in accordance with that requirement. For the matters listed below, management does not believe any possible loss or the range of any possible loss that may be incurred in connection with each matter, individually or in the aggregate, will be material to the Companys financial condition or results of operations. Between April 2014 and October 2014, the Sustainability Development Ministry of the Municipality of Juarez in Nuevo Len, Mexico, notified a subsidiary of the Company, Nueva Wal-Mart de Mexico, S. de R.L. de C.V., that there were environmental concerns with the operations at 10 stores. These concerns included but were not limited to the failure to have the appropriate number of trees planted on the property, failure to have appropriate perimeter fencing, and lack of proper zoning permits for some stores. The Company resolved this with the agency by paying a penalty of approximately $333,000 and implementing steps to address the concerns. In 2014, the Environmental and Natural History Ministry of Chiapas, Mexico, notified a subsidiary of the Company, Arrendadora de Centros Comerciales, S. de R.L. de C.V., that four stores may have been constructed without first obtaining an environmental impact license as required, and for failing to comply with conditions required by those licenses. The Ministry has proposed a penalty of approximately $857,000 and has required the Company to obtain the licenses and comply with the conditions. In September 2014, a spill of approximately 50 liters of fuel occurred at a store in Lerma, Mexico. A subsidiary of the Company, Nueva Wal-Mart de Mexico, S. de R.L. de C.V., took steps to address the spill and engaged an expert to oversee the final cleanup. The Municipality of Lerma proposed a penalty of approximately $128,000 along with implementation of a monitoring program around the spill area to address the situation. In February 2014, a division of the Health Department of the City of Vitria notified WMS Supermercados do Brasil Ltda (\"Walmart Brazil\"), a subsidiary of the Company, that a wastewater leak had been observed in the parking lot of a store. Walmart Brazil immediately took steps to address the situation and is cooperating with the agency to resolve the issue. In January 2014, a division of the State Department of Sustainable Development of Santa Catarina notified Walmart Brazil that a store did not have the proper license for a wastewater treatment system. Walmart Brazil is working with the agency to resolve the issue. In August 2013, the Company received a notice from the California Air Resources Board (\"CARB\") alleging that two products sold by the Company have exceeded volatile organic chemical limits prescribed in its California Consumer Products Regulations. The Company is responding to the allegations and cooperating with CARB's investigation. In April 2013, a subsidiary of the Company, Corporacion de Compaias Agroindustriales, operating in Costa Rica, became aware that the Municipality of Curridabat is seeking a penalty of approximately $380,000 in connection with the construction of a retaining wall seventeen years ago for a perishables distribution center that is situated along a protected river bank. The subsidiary obtained permits from the Municipality and the Secretaria Tcnica Nacional Ambiental at the time of construction, but the Municipality now alleges that the wall is non-conforming. In July 2011, the Environmental Department of Bento Gonalves notified Walmart Brazil that it is investigating alleged soil contamination from oil leakage. Walmart Brazil is cooperating with the agency and monitoring the affected area. In January 2011, the Environmental Department of Porto Alegre Municipality formally notified Walmart Brazil of soil inspection reports indicating soil contamination due to leakage of oil from power generating equipment at nine store locations in Brazil. Walmart Brazil is cooperating with the agency as well as the District Attorney's Office for the State of Rio Grande do Sul and has filed a mitigation plan to address the situation. ##TABLE_START ", "4": " ITEM 4.

As was the case with the replaced share repurchase program, the current share repurchase program has no expiration date or other restrictions limiting the period over which the Company can make share repurchases. At January 31, 2015 , authorization for $10.3 billion of share repurchases remained under the current share repurchase program.

CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES ##TABLE_ENDEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures We maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to provide reasonable assurance that information, which is required to be timely disclosed, is accumulated and communicated to management in a timely fashion. In designing and evaluating such controls and procedures, we recognize that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. Our management is necessarily required to use judgment in evaluating controls and procedures. Also, we have investments in unconsolidated entities. Since we do not control or manage those entities, our controls and procedures with respect to those entities are substantially more limited than those we maintain with respect to our consolidated subsidiaries. In the ordinary course of business, we review our internal control over financial reporting and make changes to our systems and processes to improve such controls and increase efficiency, while ensuring that we maintain an effective internal control environment. Changes may include such activities as implementing new, more efficient systems, updating existing systems, automating manual processes, migrating certain processes to our shared services organizations and increasing monitoring controls. These changes have not materially affected, and are not reasonably likely to materially affect, the Companys internal control over financial reporting. However, they allow us to continue to enhance our internal controls over financial reporting and ensure that they remain effective. An evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report was performed under the supervision and with the participation of management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer. Based upon that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are effective to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files or submits under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, is accumulated and communicated to management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure and are effective to provide reasonable assurance that such information is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified by the SEC's rules and forms.

BUSINESS ##TABLE_ENDGeneral Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. (\"Walmart,\" the \"Company\" or \"we\") helps people around the world save money and live better  anytime and anywhere  in retail stores or through our e-commerce and mobile capabilities. Through innovation, we are striving to create a customer-centric experience that seamlessly integrates digital and physical shopping. Physical retail encompasses our brick and mortar presence in each market where we operate. Digital retail is comprised of our e-commerce websites and mobile commerce applications. Each week, we serve nearly 260 million customers who visit our over 11,500 stores under 63 banners in 28 countries and e-commerce websites in 11 countries. Our strategy is to lead on price, differentiate on access, be competitive on assortment and deliver a great experience. Leading on price is designed to earn the trust of our customers every day by providing a broad assortment of quality merchandise and services at everyday low prices (\"EDLP\"). EDLP is our pricing philosophy under which we price items at a low price every day so our customers trust that our prices will not change under frequent promotional activity. Price leadership is core to who we are. Everyday low cost (\"EDLC\") is our commitment to control expenses so those cost savings can be passed along to our customers. Our digital and physical presence provides customers access to our broad assortment anytime and anywhere. We strive to give our customers and members a great digital and physical shopping experience. Our operations comprise three reportable segments: Walmart U.S., Walmart International and Sam's Club. Our fiscal year ends on January 31 for our United States (\"U.S.\") and Canadian operations. We consolidate all other operations generally using a one-month lag and on a calendar basis. Our discussion is as of and for the fiscal years ended January 31, 2016 (\"fiscal 2016 \"), January 31, 2015 (\"fiscal 2015 \") and January 31, 2014 (\"fiscal 2014 \"). During fiscal 2016 , we generated total revenues of $482.1 billion , which was primarily comprised of net sales of $478.6 billion . We maintain our principal offices at 702 S.W. 8th Street, Bentonville, Arkansas 72716, USA. Our common stock trades on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol \"WMT.\" The Development of Our Company Although Walmart was incorporated in Delaware in October 1969, the businesses conducted by our founders began in 1945 when Sam M. Walton opened a franchise Ben Franklin variety store in Newport, Arkansas. In 1946, his brother, James L. Walton, opened a similar store in Versailles, Missouri. Until 1962, our founders' business was devoted entirely to the operation of variety stores. In that year, the first Wal-Mart Discount City, which was a discount store, opened in Rogers, Arkansas. In 1983, we opened our first Sam's Club, and in 1988, we opened our first supercenter. In 1998, we opened our first Neighborhood Market. In 1991, we began our first international initiative when we entered into a joint venture in Mexico. Since then, our international presence has continued to expand and, as of January 31, 2016 , our Walmart International segment conducted business in 27 countries. In 2000, we began our first digital initiative by creating the walmart.com retail website. Since then, our digital presence has continued to grow. As of January 31, 2016 , we operated e-commerce websites in 11 countries, providing access to Walmart and our various brands around the world. 5 Information About Our Segments The Company is engaged in the operation of retail, wholesale and other units located throughout the U.S., Africa, Argentina, Brazil, Canada, Central America, Chile, China, India, Japan, Mexico and the United Kingdom. The Company's operations are conducted in three reportable segments: Walmart U.S., Walmart International and Sam's Club. The Company defines its segments as those operations whose results the chief operating decision maker (\"CODM\") regularly reviews to analyze performance and allocate resources. The Company sells similar individual products and services in each of its segments. It is impractical to segregate and identify revenues for each of these individual products and services. Walmart U.S. is our largest segment and operates retail stores in all 50 states in the U.S., Washington D.C. and Puerto Rico, with three primary store formats, as well as digital retail. Walmart U.S. generated approximately 62% of our net sales in fiscal 2016 , and of our three segments, Walmart U.S. is the largest and has historically had the highest gross profit as a percentage of net sales (\"gross profit rate\"). In addition, Walmart U.S. has historically contributed the greatest amount to the Company's net sales and operating income. Walmart International consists of operations in 27 countries outside of the U.S. and includes numerous formats divided into three major categories: retail, wholesale and other. These categories consist of numerous formats, including supercenters, supermarkets, hypermarkets, warehouse clubs, including Sam's Clubs, cash  carry, home improvement, specialty electronics, apparel stores, drug stores and convenience stores, as well as digital retail. Walmart International generated approximately 26% of our fiscal 2016 net sales. The overall gross profit rate for Walmart International is lower than that of Walmart U.S. primarily because of its merchandise mix. Walmart International is our second largest segment and has grown through acquisitions, as well as by adding retail, wholesale and other units. Sam's Club consists of membership-only warehouse clubs and operates in 48 states in the U.S. and in Puerto Rico, as well as digital retail. Sam's Club accounted for approximately 12% of our fiscal 2016 net sales. As a membership-only warehouse club, membership income is a significant component of the segment's operating income. As a result, Sam's Club operates with a lower gross profit rate and lower operating expenses as a percentage of net sales than our other segments. The Company measures the results of its segments using, among other measures, each segment's net sales and operating income, which includes certain corporate overhead allocations. From time to time, we revise the measurement of each segment's operating income, including any corporate overhead allocations, as determined by the information regularly reviewed by our CODM. When the measurement of a segment changes, previous period amounts and balances are reclassified to be comparable to the current period's presentation. Walmart U.S. Segment The Walmart U.S. segment is a mass merchandiser of consumer products, operating under the \"Walmart\" or \"Wal-Mart\" brands, as well as walmart.com. The Walmart U.S. segment had net sales of $298.4 billion , $288.0 billion and $279.4 billion for fiscal 2016 , 2015 and 2014 , respectively. During the most recent fiscal year, no single unit accounted for as much as 1% of total Company consolidated net sales. Physical. The Walmart U.S. segment operates retail stores in the U.S., including in all 50 states, Washington D.C. and Puerto Rico, with supercenters in 49 states, Washington D.C. and Puerto Rico, discount stores in 41 states and Puerto Rico and Neighborhood Markets and other small store formats in 31 states and Puerto Rico.

Hours of operation for nearly all supercenters, and an increasing number of discount stores and Neighborhood Markets, are 24 hours each day. A variety of payment methods are accepted at our stores and through our e-commerce websites and mobile commerce applications. Seasonal Aspects of Operations. The Walmart U.S. segment's business is seasonal to a certain extent due to calendar events and national and religious holidays, as well as different weather patterns. Historically, its highest sales volume and segment operating income have occurred in the fiscal quarter ending January 31. 8 Competition. The Walmart U.S. segment competes with a variety of local, national and global chains in the supermarket, discount, grocery, department, dollar, drug, variety and specialty stores, supercenter-type stores, hypermarkets, e-commerce and catalog businesses. We also compete with others for desirable sites for new or relocated retail units. Our ability to develop, open and operate units at the right locations and to deliver a customer-centric experience that seamlessly integrates digital and physical shopping largely determines our competitive position within the retail industry. We employ many programs designed to meet competitive pressures within our industry. These programs include the following: ##TABLE_START  EDLP: our pricing philosophy under which we price items at a low price every day so our customers trust that our prices will not change under frequent promotional activity; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  EDLC: everyday low cost is our commitment to control expenses so those cost savings can be passed along to our customers; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Rollbacks: our commitment to continually pass cost savings on to the customer by lowering prices on selected goods; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Savings Catcher, Save Even More and Ad Match: strategies to meet or be below a competitor's advertised price; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Walmart Pickup: customer places order online and picks it up for free from a store.

In addition, our retail website and mobile commerce applications are important factors in our competition with other retailers, particularly e-commerce retailers. Distribution. For fiscal 2016 , approximately 79% of the Walmart U.S. segment's purchases of merchandise were shipped through our 137 distribution facilities, which are located strategically throughout the U.S. The remaining merchandise we purchased was shipped directly from suppliers. General merchandise and dry grocery merchandise is transported primarily through the segment's private truck fleet. However, we contract with common carriers to transport the majority of our perishable grocery merchandise. Walmart U.S. ships merchandise purchased by customers on its retail website and through its mobile commerce applications by a number of methods from multiple locations including from its dedicated e-commerce fulfillment centers.

The Walmart International segment operates e-commerce websites in 10 countries (Argentina, Brazil, Canada, Chile, China, India, Japan, Mexico, South Africa and the United Kingdom). Customers have access through our e-commerce websites and, in countries where available, mobile commerce applications to a broad assortment of merchandise and services, both of which vary by country. Digital retail supports our physical stores with capabilities like \"Click  Collect\" in the United Kingdom and our grocery home delivery business in Mexico. Merchandise. The merchandising strategy for the Walmart International segment is similar to that of our operations in the U.S. in terms of the breadth and scope of merchandise offered for sale. While brand name merchandise accounts for a majority of our sales, we have both leveraged U.S. private brands and developed market specific private brands to serve our customers with high quality, lower priced items. Along with the private brands we market globally, such as \"Equate,\" \"George,\" \"Great Value,\" \"Holiday Time,\" \"Hometrends,\" \"Mainstays,\" \"Ol' Roy\" and \"Parent's Choice,\" our international markets have developed market specific brands including \"Aurrera,\" \"Cambridge,\" \"Chosen by You,\" \"Extra Special\" and \"Smart Price.\" In addition, we have developed relationships with regional and local suppliers in each market to ensure reliable sources of quality merchandise that is equal to national brands at low prices. Operations. The hours of operation for operating units in the Walmart International segment vary by country and by individual markets within countries, depending upon local and national ordinances governing hours of operation. Each country accepts a variety of payment methods. Seasonal Aspects of Operations. The Walmart International segment's business is seasonal to a certain extent. Historically, the segment's highest sales volume and operating income have occurred in the fourth quarter of our fiscal year. The seasonality of the business varies by country due to different national and religious holidays, festivals and customs, as well as different weather patterns. Competition. The Walmart International segment competes with a variety of local, national and global chains in the supermarket, discount, grocery, department, drug, variety and specialty stores, hypermarkets, wholesale clubs, home improvement, specialty electronic, e-commerce and catalog businesses in each of the markets in which we operate. We also operate, on a limited basis, consumer finance operations. We compete with others for desirable sites. Our ability to develop, open and operate units at the right locations and to deliver a customer-centric experience that seamlessly integrates digital and physical shopping determines, to a large extent, our competitive position in the markets in which Walmart International operates. We believe price leadership is a critical part of our business model and we continue to focus on moving our markets towards an EDLP approach. Additionally, our ability to operate food departments effectively has a significant impact on our competitive position in the markets where we operate. In the markets in which we have retail websites or retail websites and mobile commerce applications, those websites and applications help differentiate us from our competitors and help us compete with other retailers for customers and their purchases, both in the digital and the physical retail operations. 11 Distribution. We utilize a total of 176 distribution facilities located in Argentina, Brazil, Canada, Central America, Chile, China, Japan, Mexico, South Africa and the United Kingdom. Through these facilities, we process and distribute both imported and domestic products to the operating units of the Walmart International segment. During fiscal 2016 , approximately 77% of the Walmart International segment's purchases passed through these distribution facilities. Suppliers ship the balance of the Walmart International segment's purchases directly to our stores in the various markets in which we operate. The following table provides further details of our international distribution facilities, including 19 e-commerce dedicated fulfillment centers, as of December 31, 2015, with the exception of distribution facilities in Canada, which is stated as of January 31, 2016 : ##TABLE_START   Owned and Operated  Owned and Third Party Operated  Leased and Operated  Third Party Owned and Operated  Total International distribution facilities      ##TABLE_ENDWe ship merchandise purchased by customers on our retail websites and through our mobile commerce applications by a number of methods from multiple locations including from our dedicated e-commerce fulfillment centers. Sam's Club Segment The Sam's Club segment operates membership-only warehouse clubs, as well as samsclub.com, in the U.S. and had net sales of $56.8 billion , $58.0 billion and $57.2 billion for fiscal 2016 , 2015 and 2014 , respectively. During the most recent fiscal year, no single club location accounted for as much as 1% of total Company net sales. Membership. The following membership options are available to business owners and individual consumers: ##TABLE_START  Membership Type  Business Plus  Savings Plus  Business  Savings Member Type Business Owner  Individual  Business Owner  Individual Annual Membership Fee $100  $100  $45  $45 Number of Add-on Memberships ($45 each) Up to 16    Up to 8   Eligible for Cash Rewards Yes  Yes  No  No ##TABLE_ENDAll memberships include a spouse/household card at no additional cost.

Seasonal Aspects of Operations. The Sam's Club segment's business is seasonal to a certain extent due to calendar events and national and religious holidays, as well as different weather patterns. Historically, its highest sales volume and segment operating income have occurred in the fiscal quarter ending January 31. Competition. Sam's Club competes with other membership-only warehouse clubs, the largest of which are Costco Wholesale and BJ's Wholesale Club, as well as with discount retailers, retail and wholesale grocers, general merchandise wholesalers and distributors, gasoline stations, e-commerce and catalog businesses. Sam's Club also competes with other retailers and warehouse clubs for desirable new club sites. At Sam's Club, we provide value at members-only prices, a quality merchandise assortment, and bulk sizing to serve both our Savings and Business members. Our strategy allows us to differentiate ourselves within the membership-only warehouse club industry and the overall retail industry. Our e-commerce website and mobile commerce application have increasingly become important factors in our ability to compete with other membership-only warehouse clubs. Distribution. During fiscal 2016 , approximately 69% of the Sam's Club segment's non-fuel purchases were shipped from the Sam's Club segment's 24 dedicated distribution facilities located strategically throughout the U.S., or from some of the Walmart U.S. segment's distribution facilities, which service the Sam's Club segment for certain items. Suppliers shipped the balance of the Sam's Club segment's purchases directly to Sam's Club locations. The table below provides further details of our dedicated distribution facilities, including one e-commerce dedicated fulfillment center and two dedicated import facilities, as of January 31, 2016 . ##TABLE_START   Owned and Operated  Owned and Third Party Operated  Leased and Operated  Third Party Owned and Operated  Total Sam's Club distribution facilities      ##TABLE_ENDThe principal focus of Sam's Club's distribution operations is on cross-docking merchandise, while stored inventory is minimized. Cross-docking is a distribution process under which shipments are directly transferred from inbound to outbound trailers. Shipments typically spend less than 24 hours in a cross-dock facility, and sometimes less than an hour. Sam's Club uses a combination of a private truck fleet, as well as common carriers, to transport non-perishable merchandise from distribution facilities to clubs. The segment contracts with common carriers to transport perishable grocery merchandise from distribution facilities to clubs. Sam's Club ships merchandise purchased by members on its retail website and through its mobile commerce applications by a number of methods from its e-commerce dedicated fulfillment center and other distribution centers. 13 Other Segment Information Certain financial information relating to our segments is included in our Annual Report to Shareholders for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2016 (\"Annual Report to Shareholders\") under the caption \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\" and in Note 14 in the \"Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\" included therein, which information is incorporated herein by reference. Note 14 also includes information regarding total revenues and long-lived assets aggregated by our U.S. and non-U.S. operations. Such portions of the Annual Report to Shareholders are included as Exhibit 13 to this Annual Report on Form 10-K and incorporated by reference herein as expressly provided herein. Suppliers and Supply Chain As a retailer and warehouse club operator, we utilize a global supply chain that includes over 100,000 suppliers located around the world, including in the United States, from whom we purchase the merchandise that we sell in our stores and clubs. In many instances, we purchase merchandise from producers located near the stores and clubs in which such merchandise will be sold, particularly products in the \"fresh\" category. Our purchases may represent a significant percentage of a number of our suppliers' annual sales, and the volume of product we acquire from many suppliers allows us to obtain favorable pricing from such suppliers. Our suppliers are subject to standards of conduct, including requirements that they comply with local labor laws, local worker safety laws and other applicable laws. Our ability to acquire from our suppliers the assortment and volume of products we wish to offer to our customer, to receive those products within the required time through our supply chain and to distribute those products to our stores and clubs determines, in part, our in-stock levels in our stores and clubs and the attractiveness of our merchandise assortment we offer to our customers and members. Employees As of the end of fiscal 2016 , the Company and its subsidiaries employed approximately 2.3 million employees (\"associates\") worldwide, with nearly 1.5 million associates in the U.S. and 0.8 million associates internationally. Similar to other retailers, the Company has a large number of part-time, hourly or non-exempt associates and a large number of associates turn over each year. We believe our relationships with our associates are good. On February 19, 2015, the Company announced a significant initiative on pay and training for U.S. associates. Approximately 500,000 full-time and part-time associates at Walmart U.S. stores and Sam's Clubs received pay raises in the first half of fiscal 2016 and in February 2016, approximately 1.2 million full-time and part-time associates at Walmart U.S. stores and Sam's Clubs received pay increases. Also included in the announcement were comprehensive changes to our hiring, training, compensation and scheduling programs, as well as to our store management structure. These changes will give our U.S. associates the opportunity to earn higher pay and advance in their careers. Certain information relating to retirement-related benefits we provide to our associates is included in our Annual Report to Shareholders in Note 12 in the \"Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\" included therein, which information is incorporated herein by reference. In addition to retirement-related benefits, in the U.S., the Company offers a broad range of Company-paid benefits to our associates, including store discount cards or Sam's Club memberships, bonuses based on Company performance, matching a portion of purchases of our stock by associates through our Associate Stock Purchase Plan and life insurance. The Company also offers health-care benefits to eligible full-time and part-time associates in the U.S. The Company's medical plan in the U.S. has no lifetime maximum benefit for most expenses. Similarly, in the operations outside the U.S., the Company provides a variety of associate benefits that vary based on customary local practices and statutory requirements.

RISK FACTORS ##TABLE_ENDThe risks described below could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. Our business operations could also be affected by additional factors that apply to all companies operating in the U.S. and globally. Strategic Risks General or macro-economic factors, both domestically and internationally, may materially adversely affect our financial performance. General economic conditions, globally or in one or more of the markets we serve, may adversely affect our financial performance. Higher interest rates, lower or higher prices of petroleum products, including crude oil, natural gas, gasoline, and diesel fuel, higher costs for electricity and other energy, weakness in the housing market, inflation, deflation, increased costs of essential services, such as medical care and utilities, higher levels of unemployment, decreases in consumer disposable income, unavailability of consumer credit, higher consumer debt levels, changes in consumer spending and shopping patterns, fluctuations in currency exchange rates, higher tax rates, imposition of new taxes and surcharges, other changes in tax laws, other regulatory changes, overall economic slowdown and other economic factors could adversely affect consumer demand for the products and services we sell through our business, change the mix of products we sell to one with a lower average gross margin, cause a slowdown in discretionary purchases of goods, otherwise adversely affect our net sales and result in slower inventory turnover and greater markdowns on inventory. Higher levels of unemployment, inflation, deflation, decreases in consumer disposable income, unavailability of consumer credit, changes in consumer spending and shopping patterns, changes in tax and other laws, higher fuel and other energy costs, weakness in the local housing market, fluctuations in currency exchange rates, currency devaluations and other adverse developments in the economies of the other countries in which we operate may adversely affect consumer demand for our merchandise in those countries, especially those countries in which average incomes are significantly lower than average incomes in the U.S. These conditions may adversely affect our net sales, gross margins, cost of sales, inventory turnover and markdowns or otherwise adversely affect our operations and consolidated operating results. Higher interest rates, lower or higher prices of petroleum products, including crude oil, natural gas, gasoline, and diesel fuel, higher costs for electricity and other energy, higher transportation costs, inflation, higher commodity prices, higher costs of labor, insurance and healthcare, currency exchange rate fluctuations, higher tax rates and other changes in tax laws, changes in healthcare laws, the imposition of measures that create barriers to or increase the costs associated with international trade, changes in other laws and regulations and other economic factors in the U.S. and other countries in which we have operations can increase our cost of sales and operating, selling, general and administrative expenses, and otherwise adversely affect our domestic and international operations and our operating results. The economic factors that affect our operations also affect the operations and economic viability of our suppliers from whom we purchase goods, a factor that can result in an increase in the cost to us of the goods we sell to our customers or, in more extreme cases, could result in certain suppliers not producing goods in the volume typically available to us for sale. We may not timely identify or effectively respond to consumer trends or preferences, whether involving physical retail, digital retail or the integration of physical and digital retail, which could negatively affect our relationship with our customers, the demand for our products and services, and our market share. It is difficult to predict consistently and successfully the products and services our customers will demand. The success of our business depends in part on how accurately we predict consumer demand, availability of merchandise, the related impact on the demand for existing products and the competitive environment, whether for customers purchasing products at our stores and clubs, through our digital retail businesses or through the combination of both retail offerings. A critical piece of identifying consumer preferences involves price transparency, assortment of products, customer experience, convenience and the speed and cost of shipping. These factors are of primary importance to customers and they continue to increase in importance, particularly as a result of digital tools and social media available to consumers and the choices available to consumers for purchasing products online, at physical locations or through a combination of both retail offerings. Failure to timely identify or effectively respond to changing consumer tastes, preferences (including the key factors described above) and spending patterns, whether for our physical retail offerings, digital retail offerings or the integration of physical retail and digital retail, could negatively affect our relationship with our customers, the demand for our products and services and our market share. 17 We face strong competition from other retailers and wholesale club operators (whether through physical retail, digital retail or through the integration of both areas), which could materially adversely affect our financial performance. The retail business is highly competitive. Each of our segments competes for customers, employees, store and club sites, products and services and in other important aspects of its business with many other local, regional, national and global retailers and wholesale club operators, as well as other national and international internet-based retailers and retail intermediaries. Our Walmart U.S. segment competes with retailers operating discount, department, drug, dollar, variety and specialty stores, supermarkets, supercenter-type stores and hypermarkets, as well as e-commerce and catalog businesses. Our Sam's Club segment competes with other wholesale club operators, as well as discount retailers, retail and wholesale grocers and general merchandise wholesalers and distributors, gasoline stations, as well as e-commerce retailers, wholesalers and catalog businesses. Internationally, we compete with retailers who operate department, drug, dollar stores, variety and specialty stores, supermarkets, supercenter-type stores, hypermarkets, wholesale clubs, home-improvement stores, specialty electronics stores, apparel stores, wholesale clubs, cash  carry operations, convenience stores and e-commerce and catalog businesses. We compete with such retailers, wholesale club operators and e-commerce retailers in a variety of ways, including the prices at which we sell our merchandise, the merchandise selection and availability, services offered to customers, location, store hours, in-store amenities, the shopping convenience and overall shopping experience we offer, the attractiveness and ease of use of our e-commerce websites and mobile commerce applications, cost and speed of and options for delivery to our customers of the merchandise they purchase from us online, through mobile commerce applications and the integration of our physical locations with our digital retail operations. Where necessary, to compete effectively with competitors who price merchandise at points lower than the prices we set under our EDLP philosophy, we will lower our prices on goods for sale. Our ability to respond effectively to competitive pressures and changes in the retail markets could materially adversely affect our financial performance. See \"Item 1. Business\" above for additional discussion of our competitive situation in each of our reportable segments. Although the retail industry as a whole is highly fragmented, certain segments of the retail industry may undergo consolidation from time to time, which could result in increased competition and significantly alter the dynamics of the retail marketplace. Such consolidation may result in competitors with greatly improved financial resources, improved access to merchandise, greater market penetration than they previously enjoyed and other improvements in their competitive positions. Such business combinations could result in the provision of a wider variety of products and services at competitive prices by such consolidated companies, which could adversely affect our financial performance. Consumers are increasingly embracing shopping online and through mobile commerce applications. As a result, a greater portion of total consumer expenditures with all retailers and wholesale clubs could occur online and through mobile commerce applications. If we fail to maintain or grow our overall market position through the integration of our physical retail presence and digital retail, our net sales and financial performance could be adversely affected. In addition, a greater concentration of retail and wholesale club sales in online and mobile commerce sales could result in a reduction in the amount of traffic we have in our stores and clubs, which would, in turn, reduce the opportunities for cross-store or cross-club sales of merchandise that such in-store and in-club traffic creates and could reduce our sales within our stores and materially adversely affect the financial performance of the physical side of our segments overall operations. Operational Risks Natural disasters, changes in climate, and geo-political events could materially adversely affect our financial performance. The occurrence of one or more natural disasters, such as hurricanes, cyclones, typhoons, tropical storms, floods, earthquakes, tsunamis, weather conditions such as major or extended winter storms, droughts and tornadoes, whether as a result of climate change or otherwise, severe changes in climate and geo-political events, such as civil unrest or terrorist attacks in a country in which we operate or in which our suppliers are located could adversely affect our operations and financial performance. Such events could result in physical damage to, or the complete loss of, one or more of our properties, the closure of one or more stores, clubs and distribution facilities, the lack of an adequate work force in a market, the inability of customers and our associates to reach or have transportation to our stores and clubs directly affected by such events, the evacuation of the populace from areas in which our stores, clubs and distribution facilities are located, the unavailability of our retail websites and mobile commerce applications to our customers, changes in the purchasing patterns of consumers and in consumers' disposable income, the temporary or long-term disruption in the supply of products from some local and overseas suppliers, the disruption in the transport of goods from overseas, the disruption or delay in the delivery of goods to our distribution facilities or stores within a country in which we are operating, the reduction in the availability of products in our stores, the disruption of utility services to our stores and our facilities, and disruption in our communications with our stores. These events and their impacts could otherwise disrupt and adversely affect our operations in the areas in which these types of events occur, such as Superstorm Sandy in the U.S. in 2012, or numerous winter storm systems in the U.S. in 2013, 2014 and 2015, and could adversely affect our financial performance. 18 In light of the substantial premiums payable for insurance coverage for losses caused by certain natural disasters, such as hurricanes, cyclones, typhoons, tropical storms, earthquakes, floods and tsunamis in the current insurance market, as well as the limitations on available coverage for such losses, we have chosen to be primarily self-insured with respect to such losses. Although we maintain certain specific coverages for losses from physical damages in excess of certain amounts to guard against catastrophic losses suffered from such causes, we still bear the risk of losses that would be incurred as a result of any physical damage to, or the destruction of, any stores, clubs and distribution facilities, loss or spoilage of inventory, and business interruption caused by any such events below catastrophic levels of coverage, as well as in the event of a catastrophe, in excess of the aggregate limits of applicable coverages. Significant losses caused by such events could materially adversely affect our financial performance. Risks associated with the suppliers from whom our products are sourced could materially adversely affect our financial performance. The products we sell are sourced from a wide variety of domestic and international suppliers. Global sourcing of many of the products we sell is an important factor in our financial performance. We expect all of our suppliers to comply with applicable laws, including labor, safety and environmental laws, and to otherwise meet our required supplier standards of conduct. Our ability to find qualified suppliers who uphold our standards, and to access products in a timely and efficient manner is a significant challenge, especially with respect to suppliers located and goods sourced outside the U.S. Political and economic instability in the countries in which foreign suppliers and their manufacturers are located, the financial instability of suppliers, suppliers' failure to meet certain of our supplier standards (including our responsible sourcing standards), labor problems experienced by our suppliers and their manufacturers, the availability of raw materials to suppliers, merchandise safety and quality issues, disruption in the transportation of merchandise from the suppliers and manufacturers to our stores, clubs, and other facilities, including as a result of labor slowdowns at any port at which a material amount of merchandise we purchase enters into the U.S., currency exchange rates, transport availability and cost, transport security, inflation and other factors relating to the suppliers and the countries in which they are located are beyond our control. In addition, the U.S.'s foreign trade policies, tariffs and other impositions on imported goods, trade sanctions imposed on certain countries, the limitation on the importation of certain types of goods or of goods containing certain materials from other countries and other factors relating to foreign trade are beyond our control. These and other factors affecting our suppliers and our access to products could adversely affect our financial performance. If the products we sell are not safe or otherwise fail to meet our customers' expectations, we could lose customers, incur liability for any injuries suffered by our customers using or consuming a product we sell or otherwise experience material adverse effects to our financial performance. Our customers count on us to provide them with safe products. Concerns regarding the safety of food and non-food products that we source from our suppliers or that we prepare and then sell could cause customers to avoid purchasing certain products from us, or to seek alternative sources of supply for all of their food and non-food needs, even if the basis for the concern is outside of our control. Any lost confidence on the part of our customers would be difficult and costly to reestablish. As such, any issue regarding the safety of any food and non-food items we sell, regardless of the cause, could adversely affect our financial performance. We rely extensively on information systems to process transactions, summarize results and manage our business. Disruptions in both our primary and secondary (back-up) systems could harm our ability to conduct our operations. Although we have independent, redundant and physically separate primary and secondary information systems, given the number of individual transactions we have each year, it is critical that we maintain uninterrupted operation of our business-critical information systems. Our information systems, including our back-up systems, are subject to damage or interruption from power outages, computer and telecommunications failures, computer viruses, worms, other malicious computer programs, denial-of-service attacks, security breaches (through cyberattacks from cyber-attackers and sophisticated organizations), catastrophic events such as fires, tornadoes, earthquakes and hurricanes, and usage errors by our associates. If our information systems and our back-up systems are damaged, breached or cease to function properly, we may have to make a significant investment to repair or replace them, and we may suffer interruptions in our operations in the interim. Any material interruption in both our information systems and back-up systems may have a material adverse effect on our business or results of operations. In addition, we are pursuing complex initiatives to transform our information technology processes and systems, which will include, for many of our information systems, establishing common processes across our lines of business. The risk of system disruption is increased when significant system changes are undertaken, although we believe that our change management process will mitigate this risk. If we fail to integrate our information systems and processes, we may fail to realize the cost savings anticipated to be derived from these initiatives. 19 If the technology-based systems that give our customers the ability to shop with us online do not function effectively, our operating results, as well as our ability to grow our e-commerce business globally, could be materially adversely affected. Many of our customers shop with us over our e-commerce websites and mobile commerce applications, including walmart.com and samsclub.com in the U.S. and our retail websites in 10 other countries, which are a part of our multi-channel sales strategy. Increasingly, customers are using computers, tablets, and smart phones to shop online and through mobile commerce applications with us and with our competitors and to do comparison shopping. We are increasingly using social media to interact with our customers and as a means to enhance their shopping experience. As a part of our multi-channel sales strategy, we offer \"Walmart Pickup\" and \"Club Pickup\" and in a growing number of locations, \"Online Grocery\" programs under which many products available for purchase online can be shipped to and picked up by the customer at his or her local Walmart store or Sam's Club, which provides additional customer traffic at such stores and clubs. Multi-channel retailing is a rapidly evolving part of the retail industry and of our operations in the U.S. and in a number of markets in which our Walmart International segment operates. We must anticipate and meet our customers' changing expectations while adjusting for new developments and technology investments by our competitors through focusing on the building and delivery of a seamless shopping experience across all channels by each operating segment. Any failure on our part to provide attractive, user-friendly e-commerce platforms that offer a wide assortment of merchandise at competitive prices and with low cost and rapid delivery options and that continually meet the changing expectations of online shoppers and developments in online and mobile commerce application merchandising and related technology could place us at a competitive disadvantage, result in the loss of e-commerce and other sales, harm our reputation with customers, have a material adverse impact on the growth of our e-commerce business globally and could have a material adverse impact on our business and results of operations. Any failure to maintain the security of the information relating to our company, customers, members, associates and vendors that we hold, whether as a result of cybersecurity attacks on our information systems or otherwise, could damage our reputation with customers, members, associates, vendors and others, could cause us to incur substantial additional costs and to become subject to litigation, and could materially adversely affect our operating results. As do most retailers, we receive and store in our digital information systems certain personal information about our customers and members, and we receive and store personal information concerning our associates and vendors. We also utilize third-party service providers for a variety of reasons, including, without limitation, encryption and authentication technology, content delivery to customers, back-office support, and other functions. In addition, our online operations at www.walmart.com, www.samsclub.com and our websites in certain of our foreign markets depend upon the secure transmission of confidential information over public networks, including information permitting cashless payments. Each year, cyber-attackers make numerous attempts to access the information stored in our information systems. We maintain substantial security measures to protect, and to prevent unauthorized access to, such information and have security processes, protocols and standards that are applicable to our third-party service providers to protect information from our systems to which they have access to under their engagements with us. However, we or our third-party service providers may be unable to anticipate one or more of the rapidly evolving and increasingly sophisticated means by which cyber-attackers may attempt to defeat our security measures or those of our third-party service providers and breach our or our third-party service providers' information systems. During fiscal 2016, we were notified that a third party service provider that hosts the online photo center for Walmart Canada suffered a security breach that compromised information of users of that company's site, including some Walmart Canada customers, which we believe has not had a material impact on Walmart Canada or the Company. Walmart Canada discontinued use of this third party service provider. Sam's Club in the United States also used the same third party service provider to host its online photo center through a different system than the one used by Walmart Canada. After the breach in Canada, Sam's Club suspended the operation of the online photo center until a security review could be completed by the third party service provider. Once the security review was complete and new technology with enhanced security measures was implemented by the third party service provider, along with a determination that the information of Sam's Club members was not compromised by the security breach, Sam's Club resumed the operation of the online photo center through the same third party service provider. Cyber threats are rapidly evolving and are becoming increasingly sophisticated. As cyber threats evolve and become more difficult to detect and successfully defend against, one or more cyber threats might defeat our security measures or those of our third-party service providers in the future like the incident referenced above and obtain the personal information of customers, members, associates and vendors that we hold or to which our third-party service providers have access, and we or our third-party service providers may not discover any security breach and loss of information for a significant period of time after the security breach occurs. Moreover, associate error or malfeasance, faulty password management or other irregularities may result in a defeat of our or our third-party service providers' security measures and breach our or our third-party service providers' information systems (whether digital or otherwise). 20 Any breach of our security measures or those of our third-party service providers and loss of our confidential information, which could be undetected for a period of time, or any failure by us to comply with applicable privacy and information security laws and regulations could cause us to incur significant costs to protect any customers and members whose personal data was compromised and to restore customer and member confidence in us and to make changes to our information systems and administrative processes to address security issues and compliance with applicable laws and regulations. In addition, such events could materially adversely affect our reputation with our customers, members, associates, vendors and shareholders, as well as our operations, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity, could result in the release to the public of confidential information about our operations and financial condition and performance and could result in litigation against us or the imposition of penalties, fines, fees or liabilities, which may not be covered by our insurance policies. Moreover, a security breach could require us to devote significant management resources to address the problems created by the security breach and to expend significant additional resources to upgrade further the security measures that we employ to guard such important personal information against cyberattacks and other attempts to access such information and could result in a disruption of our operations, particularly our digital retail operations. We accept payments using a variety of methods, including cash, checks, credit and debit cards, our private label cards and gift cards, and we may offer new payment options over time, which may have information security risk implications. By accepting debit and credit cards as a retailer for payment, we are subject to the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (\"PCI DSS\"), issued by the Payment Card Industry Security Standards Council. PCI DSS contains compliance guidelines and standards with regard to our security surrounding the physical and electronic storage, processing and transmission of individual cardholder data. The payment card industry set October 1, 2015 as the date on which it will shift liability for certain transactions to retailers who are not able to accept Europay, MasterCard, Visa (EMV) chip card credit and debit transactions. While we already accept many EMV cards, if we are unable to fully implement EMV as planned, we may incur increased costs associated with the liability shift. By accepting debit cards for payment, we are also subject to compliance with the American National Standards Institute encryption standards and payment network security operating guidelines. Even though we comply with these guidelines and standards and other information security measures, we cannot be certain that the security measures we maintain to protect all of our information technology systems are able to prevent, contain or detect any cyberattacks, cyber terrorism, or security breaches from known malware or malware that may be developed in the future. To the extent that any disruption results in the loss, damage or misappropriation of information, we may be materially adversely affected by claims from customers, financial institutions, regulatory authorities, payment card networks and others. In addition, the cost of complying with stricter privacy and information security laws and standards could be significant to us. Our failure to attract and retain qualified associates, increases in wage and benefit costs, changes in laws and other labor issues could materially adversely affect our financial performance. Our ability to continue to conduct and expand our operations depends on our ability to attract and retain a large and growing number of qualified associates globally. Our ability to meet our labor needs, including our ability to find qualified personnel to fill positions that become vacant at our existing stores, clubs and distribution centers, while controlling our associate wage and related labor costs, is generally subject to numerous external factors, including the availability of a sufficient number of qualified persons in the work force of the markets in which we are located, unemployment levels within those markets, prevailing wage rates, changing demographics, health and other insurance costs and adoption of new or revised employment and labor laws and regulations. If we are unable to locate, to attract or to retain qualified personnel, the quality of service we provide to our customers may decrease and our financial performance may be adversely affected. The wage increases for over 500,000 associates in our operations in the U.S. and investment in other initiatives for our associates in the U.S. that we announced in February 2015, and related wage increases for 1.2 million associates aggregating $1.5 billion in the year ending January 31, 2017 (\"fiscal 2017\") will increase our wage and other labor expenses significantly. If we cannot offset the increases in our wage expenses resulting from those wage increases by increasing our gross profit, achieving decreases in our operating, selling, general and administrative expense or a combination of both in the year ending January 31, 2018 and thereafter, our consolidated operating income and our consolidated income from continuing operations could continue to be less than our consolidated operating income and consolidated income from continuing operations for our fiscal years prior to fiscal 2017. In addition, if our costs of labor or related costs increase even more significantly for other reasons or if new or revised labor laws, rules or regulations or healthcare laws are adopted or implemented that further increase our labor costs, our financial performance could be materially adversely affected. 21 We may face impediments to our expansion of physical retail in the U.S., which may materially adversely affect our financial performance. Our expansion strategy in the U.S. depends upon our ability to execute our retail concepts successfully in new markets within the U.S. and upon our ability to increase the number of stores in markets in which we currently have operations. Our ability to open additional supercenters, discount stores, Neighborhood Markets, other store formats, and Sam's Clubs depends in large measure upon our ability to locate, hire and retain qualified personnel and to acquire new store sites on acceptable terms. Local real estate, land use, zoning, and other regulations restricting the construction of buildings of the type in which we operate our various formats, as well as local community action opposed to the location of specific stores at specific sites and the adoption of certain local laws restricting our operations, may affect our ability to open new stores and clubs, to convert discount stores into supercenters or to relocate or expand existing units in certain cities and states, including in market areas in which we have no existing operations. Increased real estate, construction and development costs could limit our growth opportunities and our ability to convert our discount stores into supercenters. Moreover, our expansion in our existing local market areas may be limited if the opening of new stores or clubs would result in an unacceptable level of cannibalization of the sales of existing stores or clubs. If we are unable to open new supercenters, discount stores, Neighborhood Markets, other small formats or Sam's Clubs or continue to convert discount stores into supercenters, our financial performance, such as net sales and operating income growth, could be materially adversely affected. In addition, if consumers in the markets into which we expand or in which we build stores of a new format are not receptive to our retail concepts or are otherwise not receptive to our presence in a market, our financial performance could be adversely affected. Impediments to the expansion of our Walmart International operations could materially adversely affect our financial performance. Our business strategy for our Walmart International segment includes expansion by selective acquisitions and strategic alliances that add new stores and markets to our existing Walmart International business, as well as opening new units in the countries in which we have existing operations. In the countries in which we have existing operations, new units may be opened in the formats already existing in those countries or may be opened in newly introduced formats, such as supercenters or Sam's Clubs, not previously operated in those markets. As in the U.S., our ability to open new stores or to expand or relocate existing stores in a market served by our Walmart International segment depends in large measure upon our ability to locate, hire and retain qualified personnel and our ability to acquire new store sites on acceptable terms. Local laws can affect our ability to acquire attractive pre-existing buildings in which to locate units or sites on which to build new units or to expand existing units. In addition, access to local suppliers of certain types of goods may limit our ability to add new units or to expand product selections in existing units in certain markets, especially in those markets in which consumers desire to purchase locally produced goods. Moreover, cultural differences in some markets into which we expand or into which we introduce new retail concepts may result in the consumers in those markets not being as receptive to our retail concepts as we anticipate those consumers will be and may make an effective response to such issues more difficult to achieve. Economic, business and legal environments in foreign markets may be such that we are unable to expand our operations and increase our net sales in those markets as we may want to do and could result in the closure of our existing units in such markets, which closures impede the growth of our international operations. Finally, some countries have foreign investment laws that prohibit us or limit us from holding a controlling interest in retail operations in those countries, making our entry into those markets, which may present attractive growth opportunities, more difficult, if not impossible. If we cannot effectively continue to expand our Walmart International segment, our ability to grow our business could be adversely affected. We may be unable to continue to identify suitable acquisition candidates at acceptable prices and may not be successful in completing the acquisition of any such candidate identified. Although we ultimately believe we will be able to successfully integrate any newly acquired operations into our existing operations, no certainty exists that future acquisitions or alliances will be successfully integrated into our operations or can be successfully integrated in a reasonable time. Our failure to identify appropriate candidates for acquisition or alliance or to integrate effectively future acquisitions and alliances into our existing operations could adversely affect the growth of our Walmart International segment and our future financial performance. Financial Risks Fluctuations in foreign exchange rates may materially adversely affect our financial performance and our reported results of operations. Our operations in countries other than the U.S. are conducted primarily in the local currencies of those countries. Our consolidated financial statements are denominated in U.S. dollars, and to prepare those financial statements we must translate the amounts of the assets, liabilities, net sales, other revenues and expenses of our operations outside of the U.S. from local currencies into U.S. dollars using exchange rates for the current period. In recent years, fluctuations in currency exchange rates that were unfavorable to us coupled with such translations have had a material adverse effect on our reported results of 22 operations. As a result of such translations, fluctuations in currency exchange rates from period-to-period that are unfavorable to us may also result in our consolidated financial statements reflecting significant adverse period-over-period changes in our financial performance or reflecting a period-over-period improvement in our financial performance that is not as robust as it would be without such fluctuations in the currency exchange rates. Such unfavorable currency exchange rate fluctuations will adversely affect the reported performance of our Walmart International operating segment and have a corresponding adverse effect on our reported consolidated results of operations. We may pay for products we purchase for sale in our stores and clubs around the world with a currency other than the local currency of the country in which the goods will be sold. When we must acquire the currency to pay for such products and the exchange rates for the payment currency fluctuate in a manner unfavorable to us, our cost of sales may increase and we may be unable or unwilling to change the prices at which we sell those goods to address that increase in our costs, with a corresponding adverse effect on our gross profit. Consequently, fluctuations in currency exchange rates may adversely affect our results of operations. Failure to meet market expectations for our financial performance could adversely affect the market price and volatility of our stock. We believe that the price of our stock generally reflects high market expectations for our future operating results. Any failure to meet or delay in meeting these expectations, including our comparable store and club sales growth rates, e-commerce growth rates, gross margin, earnings and earnings per share or new store and club openings could cause the market price of our stock to decline, as could changes in our dividend or stock repurchase programs or policies. Regulatory, Compliance, Reputational and Other Risks Our operations subject us to risks associated with the legislative, judicial, accounting, regulatory, political and economic risks and conditions specific to the countries or regions in which we operate, which could materially adversely affect our business or financial performance. We are currently engaged in the operation of retail through our wholly-owned subsidiaries operating in Argentina, Brazil, Canada, Chile, China, India, Japan and the United Kingdom; our majority-owned subsidiaries operating in Africa, Central America and Mexico; and our joint ventures and other controlled subsidiaries in China in addition to our U.S. operations. During fiscal 2016 , our Walmart International operations generated approximately 26% of our consolidated net sales. Our divisions also source goods and services from other countries. The future expansion of our operations in countries outside the U.S. could result in our international operations accounting for a larger portion of our net sales in future years. Our future operating results in these countries or in other countries or regions throughout the world could be negatively affected by a variety of factors, most of which are beyond our control. These factors include political conditions, including political instability, local and global economic conditions, legal and regulatory constraints, local product safety and environmental laws, tax regulations, local labor laws, anti-money laundering laws and regulations, trade policies, currency regulations, and other matters in any of the countries or regions in which we operate, now or in the future. In particular, Brazilian federal, state and local laws are complex and subject to varying interpretations. Although the Company believes it complies with those laws, the Company's subsidiaries in Brazil are party to a large number of labor claims and non-income tax assessments, which have arisen during the normal course of business in Brazil. These matters are subject to inherent uncertainties and if decided adversely to the Company, could materially adversely affect our financial performance. Moreover, the economies of some of the countries in which we have operations have in the past suffered from high rates of inflation and currency devaluations, which, if they occurred again, could adversely affect our financial performance. Other factors which may impact our international operations include foreign trade, monetary and fiscal policies both of the U.S. and of other countries, laws, regulations and other activities of foreign governments, agencies and similar organizations, and risks associated with having numerous facilities located in countries which have historically been less stable than the U.S. Additional risks inherent in our international operations generally include, among others, the costs and difficulties of managing international operations, adverse tax consequences and greater difficulty in enforcing intellectual property rights in countries other than the U.S. The various risks inherent in doing business in the U.S. generally also exist when doing business outside of the U.S., and may be exaggerated by the difficulty of doing business in numerous sovereign jurisdictions due to differences in culture, laws and regulations. In foreign countries in which we have operations, a risk exists that our associates, contractors or agents could, in contravention of our policies, engage in business practices prohibited by U.S. laws and regulations applicable to us, such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the laws and regulations of other countries such as the UK Bribery Act. We maintain policies prohibiting such business practices and have in place enhanced global anti-corruption compliance programs designed to ensure compliance with these laws and regulations. Nevertheless, we remain subject to the risk that one or more of our associates, contractors or agents, including those based in or from countries where practices that violate such U.S. laws and regulations or the laws and regulations of other countries may be customary, will engage in business practices that are prohibited by our 23 policies, circumvent our compliance programs and, by doing so, violate such laws and regulations. Any such violations, even if prohibited by our internal policies, could adversely affect our business or financial performance and our reputation. We are also subject to income taxes and other taxes in both the U.S. and the foreign jurisdictions in which we currently operate or have historically operated. The determination of our worldwide provision for income taxes and current and deferred tax assets and liabilities requires judgment and estimation. Our income taxes could be materially adversely affected by earnings being lower than anticipated in jurisdictions that have lower statutory tax rates and higher than anticipated in jurisdictions that have higher statutory tax rates, by changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities, or by changes in tax laws, regulations, or accounting principles. We are subject to regular review and audit by both domestic and foreign tax authorities as well as subject to the prospective and retrospective effects of changing tax regulations and legislation. Although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, the ultimate tax outcome may materially differ from the tax amounts recorded in our consolidated financial statements and may materially affect our income tax provision, net income, or cash flows in the period or periods for which such determination and settlement is made. We are subject to certain legal proceedings that may materially adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. We are involved in a number of legal proceedings, which include consumer, employment, tort and other litigation. In particular, we are currently a defendant in a number of cases containing class-action allegations in which the plaintiffs have brought claims under federal and state wage and hour laws, as well as a number of cases containing class-action allegations in which the plaintiffs have brought claims under federal and state consumer laws. In addition, ASDA Stores, Ltd. (\"ASDA\"), a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, has been named as a defendant in over 7,000 \"equal value\" claims that are pending in the Manchester Employment Tribunal (the \"Employment Tribunal\") in the United Kingdom. The claimants, who are current and former ASDA store employees, allege that the work performed by female employees in ASDA's retail stores is of equal value in terms of, among other things, the demands of their jobs to that of male employees working in ASDA's warehouses and distribution facilities, and that the disparity in pay between these different job positions is not objectively justified. The claimants are seeking: (i) back pay consisting of the difference between the wage rate paid in the stores and the rate paid in the warehouses and distribution facilities for the period of their employment up to a maximum of six years under the statute of limitations; and (ii) an increase in the store rate prospectively, to match that paid in the warehouses and the distribution facilities. On January 30, 2015, the Employment Tribunal held a case management conference in order to set a schedule for addressing jurisdictional challenges and other issues involved in the first phase of the litigation. At this time, it is undetermined: (i) how many of these claims may ultimately be filed; or (ii) whether the Employment Tribunal will decide to hear each claim individually or to consolidate them into groups of similar claims and proceed with the trial of \"test cases.\" Determinations made in such test cases, if any, might be asserted as binding in subsequent trials of claims within that group and any subsequent claims involving the same issues. Moreover, a determination as to the appropriate rate of pay for a particular store position might be asserted as the basis for additional claims for back pay or wage increases by other store associates who perform, or who have performed, like work in that position. On March 23, 2015, ASDA asked the Employment Tribunal to stay all proceedings, contending that the High Court, which is the superior first instance civil court in the UK that is headquartered in the Royal Courts of Justice in the City of London, is the more convenient and appropriate forum to hear these claims. On March 23, 2015, ASDA also asked the Employment Tribunal to \"strike out\" substantially all of the claims for failing to comply with Employment Tribunal rules. Following argument and appellate proceedings, the claims have remained in the Employment Tribunal. The issue of stay, strike out, and the scope of Employment Tribunal rules are the subject of further appellate proceedings. We discuss this case and other litigation to which we are party below under the caption \"Item 3. Legal Proceedings\" and in Note 10 in the \"Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements,\" which are part of our Annual Report to Shareholders, which are incorporated by reference in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and are included as an exhibit to this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 24 We could be subject to liability, penalties and other sanctions and other adverse consequences arising out of our on-going FCPA matter. The Audit Committee of our Board of Directors, which is composed solely of independent directors, is conducting an internal investigation into, among other things, alleged violations of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (\"FCPA\") and other alleged crimes or misconduct in connection with certain of our foreign subsidiaries, including Wal-Mart de Mxico, S.A.B. de C.V., or Walmex, and whether we appropriately handled prior allegations of such violations and/or misconduct. We are also conducting a voluntary global review of our policies, practices and internal controls for FCPA compliance and strengthening our global anti-corruption compliance programs. Since the implementation of the global review and enhanced anti-corruption compliance programs, the Audit Committee and we have identified or been made aware of additional allegations regarding potential violations of the FCPA. Inquiries or investigations regarding allegations of potential FCPA violations have been commenced in a number of foreign markets in which we operate, including, but not limited to, Brazil, China and India. In November 2011, we voluntarily disclosed our investigative activity to the U.S. Department of Justice (the \"DOJ\") and the SEC, and we have been informed by the DOJ and the SEC that we are the subject of their respective investigations into possible violations of the FCPA. A number of federal and local government agencies in Mexico have also initiated investigations of these matters. Furthermore, lawsuits relating to the matters under investigation have been filed by several of our shareholders against us, certain of our current and former directors and officers and certain of Walmex's current and former officers. We could be exposed to a variety of negative consequences as a result of these matters. One or more enforcement actions could be instituted in respect of the matters that are the subject of some or all of the on-going government investigations, and such actions, if brought, may result in judgments, settlements, fines, penalties, injunctions, cease and desist orders, debarment or other relief, criminal convictions and/or penalties. The existing and any additional shareholder lawsuits may result in judgments against us and our current and former directors and officers named in those proceedings. We cannot predict at this time the outcome or impact of the government investigations, the shareholder lawsuits, or our own internal investigations and review. Moreover, we expect to continue to incur costs (incremental to the $126 million of costs incurred in fiscal 2016 and the costs incurred in prior years) in conducting our on-going review and investigations and in responding to requests for information or subpoenas seeking documents, testimony and other information in connection with the government investigations and in defending the existing and any additional shareholder lawsuits and any governmental proceedings that are instituted against us or any of our current or former officers. These matters may require the involvement of certain members of our senior management that could impinge on the time they have available to devote to other matters relating to our business. We also expect that there will be ongoing media and governmental interest, including additional news articles from media publications on these matters that could impact the perception of our role as a corporate citizen among certain audiences. Our process of assessing and responding to the governmental investigations and the shareholder lawsuits continues. While we believe that it is probable that we will incur a loss from these matters, given the on-going nature and complexity of the review, inquiries and investigations, we cannot reasonably estimate any loss or range of loss that may arise from these matters. Although we do not presently believe that these matters will have a material adverse effect on our business, given the inherent uncertainties in such situations, we can provide no assurance that these matters will not be material to our business in the future. ##TABLE_START ", "1B": " ITEM 1B.

ASDA Equal Value Claims: Ms S Brierley  Others v ASDA Stores Ltd (2406372/2008  Others-Manchester Employment Tribunal). II. CERTAIN OTHER PROCEEDINGS: The Company is a defendant in several lawsuits in which the complaints closely track the allegations set forth in a news story that appeared in The New York Times ( the \" Times \" ) on April 21, 2012. One of these is a securities lawsuit that was filed on May 7, 2012, in the United States District Court for the Middle District of Tennessee, and subsequently transferred to the Western District of Arkansas, in which the plaintiff alleges various violations of the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (the \"FCPA\") beginning in 2005, and asserts violations of Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, relating to certain prior disclosures of the Company. The plaintiff seeks to represent a class of shareholders who purchased or acquired stock of the Company between December 8, 2011, and April 20, 2012, and seeks damages and other relief based on allegations that the defendants' conduct affected the value of such stock. In addition, a number of derivative complaints have been filed in Delaware and Arkansas, also tracking the allegations of the Times story, and naming various current and former officers and directors as additional defendants. The plaintiffs in the derivative suits (in which the Company is a nominal defendant) allege, among other things, that the defendants who are or were directors or officers of the Company breached their fiduciary duties in connection with oversight of FCPA compliance. All of the derivative suits have been combined into two consolidated proceedings, one of which was consolidated in the United States District Court for the Western District of Arkansas and the other in the Delaware Court of Chancery. On March 31, 2015, the Western District of Arkansas granted the defendants' motion to dismiss the consolidated derivative proceedings in that court. On April 15, 2015, plaintiffs filed their notice of appeal with the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit. Management does not believe any possible loss or the range of any possible loss that may be incurred in connection with these proceedings will be material to the Company's financial condition or results of operations.

Delaware Derivative Litigation, Delaware Ct. of Chancery, 4/25/12. 27 III. ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS: Item 103 of SEC Regulation S-K requires disclosure of certain environmental matters. The following matters are disclosed in accordance with that requirement. For the matters listed below, management does not believe any possible loss or the range of any possible loss that may be incurred in connection with each matter, individually or in the aggregate, will be material to the Company's financial condition or results of operations. During fiscal year 2015, a California Greenwashing Task Force informed the Company (including one of its subsidiaries) that it was investigating whether the Company and its subsidiary had violated a California statute that prohibits the sale of plastic products labeled by the Company's and its subsidiary's suppliers as \"biodegradable\" or \"compostable.\" On January 13, 2016, the Task Force sent the Company and its subsidiary a settlement demand with the following terms: a $1.5 million civil penalty; a restitution program; a compliance program; and investigative costs. On March 7, 2016, the Company and its subsidiary responded to the offer and are continuing to work with the Task Force towards a resolution. On April 23, 2015, Wal-Mart Transportation LLC, a subsidiary of the Company, received a Finding and Notice of Violation from the Environmental Protection Agency alleging that Walmart Transportation violated the California Air Resources Board's Truck and Bus regulations by failing to install particulate matter filters on some diesel fuelled vehicles. The Company is responding to the allegations and is cooperating with the agency. On April 6, 2015, representatives for the Brazilian Institute of the Environment alleged that WMS Supermercados do Brasil Ltda (\"Walmart Brazil\") had failed to file required reports documenting the number of tires imported, sold and recycled. The agency proposed a penalty of approximately $857,000 and prohibited Walmart Brazil from selling or importing tires until the matter is resolved. In October 2015, Walmart Brazil filed its defense with the agency against the imposition of this penalty. In September 2014, a spill of approximately 50 liters of fuel occurred at a store in Lerma, Mexico. A subsidiary of the Company, Nueva Wal-Mart de Mexico, S. de R.L. de C.V., took steps to address the spill and engaged an expert to oversee the final cleanup. The Municipality of Lerma proposed a penalty of approximately $128,000 along with the implementation of a monitoring program around the spill area to address the situation. The Company implemented a monitoring program which concluded that there was no contamination in the spill area and is challenging the penalty in an administrative court. In February 2014, a division of the Health Department of the City of Vitria notified Walmart Brazil, a subsidiary of the Company, that a wastewater leak had been observed in the parking lot of a store. Walmart Brazil has been cooperating with the agency and believes that it has addressed the situation. In January 2014, a division of the State Department of Sustainable Development of Santa Catarina notified Walmart Brazil that a store did not have the proper license for a wastewater treatment system. Walmart Brazil resolved the matter by paying a penalty of approximately $50,000 and is awaiting the issuance of the license. In August 2013, the Company received a notice from the California Air Resources Board (\"CARB\") alleging that two products sold by the Company have exceeded volatile organic chemical limits prescribed in its California Consumer Products Regulations. The Company is responding to the allegations and cooperating with CARB's investigation. In April 2013, a subsidiary of the Company, Corporacion de Compaias Agroindustriales, operating in Costa Rica, became aware that the Municipality of Curridabat is seeking a penalty of approximately $380,000 in connection with the construction of a retaining wall seventeen years ago for a perishables distribution center that is situated along a protected river bank. The subsidiary obtained permits from the Municipality and the Secretaria Tcnica Nacional Ambiental at the time of construction, but the Municipality now alleges that the wall is non-conforming. In April and May 2011, the Environmental and Natural History Ministry of Chiapas, Mexico (\"Ministry\") notified a subsidiary of the Company, Arrendadora de Centros Comerciales, S. de R.L. de C.V. (\"Arrendadora\"), that five stores may have been constructed without first obtaining an environmental impact license as required, and for failing to comply with conditions required by those licenses. The Ministry proposed a penalty of approximately $178,000 related to such stores and Arrendadora is currently in discussions with the Ministry regarding payment of such amount. In 2014, the Ministry informed Arrendadora it believed that four additional stores may have been constructed with the same deficiencies. The Ministry proposed a penalty of approximately $640,000 in respect to such additional stores and also required Arrendadora to obtain the licenses and comply with the required conditions. Arrendadora was subsequently released by an administrative court from the payment of such penalty. Arrendadora is in compliance with the conditions required for the licenses of all the foregoing stores. In January 2011, the Environmental Department of Porto Alegre Municipality formally notified Walmart Brazil of soil inspection reports indicating soil contamination due to leakage of oil from power generating equipment at nine store locations in Brazil. Walmart Brazil is cooperating with the agency as well as the District Attorney's Office for the State of Rio Grande do Sul and has filed a mitigation plan to address the situation. ##TABLE_START ", "4": " ITEM 4.

Such information appears in the portion of the Annual Report to Shareholders that is in Exhibit 13 to this Annual Report on Form 10-K and incorporated by reference herein. Our common stock is primarily traded in the U.S. on the New York Stock Exchange. At March 28, 2016 , the latest practicable date, there were 243,327 common stock shareholders of record. From time to time, the Company repurchases shares of its common stock under share repurchase programs authorized by the Board of Directors. On October 13, 2015, the Company's Board of Directors replaced the previous $15.0 billion share repurchase program, which had approximately $8.6 billion of remaining authorization for share repurchases as of that date, with a new $20.0 billion share repurchase program. As was the case with the replaced share repurchase program, the current share repurchase program has no expiration date or other restrictions limiting the period over which the Company can make share repurchases. At January 31, 2016 , authorization for $17.5 billion of share repurchases remained under the current share repurchase program. Any repurchased shares are constructively retired and returned to an unissued status.

CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES ##TABLE_ENDEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures We maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to provide reasonable assurance that information, which is required to be timely disclosed, is accumulated and communicated to management in a timely fashion. In designing and evaluating such controls and procedures, we recognize that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. Our management is necessarily required to use judgment in evaluating controls and procedures. Also, we have investments in unconsolidated entities. Since we do not control or manage those entities, our controls and procedures with respect to those entities are substantially more limited than those we maintain with respect to our consolidated subsidiaries. In the ordinary course of business, we review our internal control over financial reporting and make changes to our systems and processes to improve such controls and increase efficiency, while ensuring that we maintain an effective internal control environment. Changes may include such activities as implementing new, more efficient systems, updating existing systems, automating manual processes, migrating certain processes to our shared services organizations and increasing monitoring controls. These changes have not materially affected, and are not reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company's internal control over financial reporting. However, they allow us to continue to enhance our internal control over financial reporting and ensure that our internal control environment remains effective. An evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report was performed under the supervision and with the participation of management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer. Based upon that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are effective to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files or submits under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, is accumulated and communicated to management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure and are effective to provide reasonable assurance that such information is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified by the SEC's rules and forms. Reports on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting Management's report on internal control over financial reporting and the attestation report of Ernst  Young LLP, the Company's independent registered public accounting firm, on the Company's internal control over financial reporting are incorporated herein by reference to all information under the captions \"Management's Report to Our Shareholders\" and \"Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting,\" respectively, included in our Annual Report to Shareholders. Such information is included in Exhibit 13 to this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting During the second quarter of fiscal 2016, we identified and disclosed a material weakness in our controls over accounting for leases. The material weakness in internal control over financial reporting resulted from a lack of controls which allowed for the misinterpretation and historical misapplication of Accounting Standards Codification 840, Leases (\"ASC 840\") regarding sale-leaseback accounting, primarily lessee involvement in the construction of leased assets. Specifically, we did not have adequate controls in place to properly identify and account for leases that were subject to the sale-leaseback accounting guidance, primarily leases in which we made payments for certain structural components included in the lessor's construction of the leased assets, which should have resulted in the Company being deemed the owner of the leased assets for accounting purposes. To remediate the material weakness described above, we designed and implemented controls and enhanced and revised the design of existing controls and procedures to properly apply sale-leaseback accounting, primarily lessee involvement in the construction of leased assets, under ASC 840. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016, we successfully completed the testing necessary to conclude that the material weakness has been remediated. Except as noted above, there has been no change in the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of January 31, 2016 , that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company's internal control over financial reporting. ##TABLE_START ", "9B": " ITEM 9B.

BUSINESS ##TABLE_ENDGeneral Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. (\"Walmart,\" the \"Company\" or \"we\") helps people around the world save money and live better  anytime and anywhere  in retail stores or through our e-commerce and mobile capabilities. Through innovation, we are striving to create a customer-centric experience that seamlessly integrates digital and physical shopping and saves time for our customers. Physical retail encompasses our brick and mortar presence in each market where we operate. Digital retail is comprised of our e-commerce websites and mobile commerce applications. Each week, we serve over 260 million customers who visit our 11,695 stores under 59 banners in 28 countries and e-commerce websites in 11 countries. Our strategy is to lead on price, differentiate on access, be competitive on assortment and deliver a great experience. Leading on price is designed to earn the trust of our customers every day by providing a broad assortment of quality merchandise and services at everyday low prices (\"EDLP\"). EDLP is our pricing philosophy under which we price items at a low price every day so our customers trust that our prices will not change under frequent promotional activity. Price leadership is core to who we are. Everyday low cost (\"EDLC\") is our commitment to control expenses so those cost savings can be passed along to our customers. Our digital and physical presence provides customers access to our broad assortment anytime and anywhere. We strive to give our customers and members a great digital and physical shopping experience. Our operations comprise three reportable segments: Walmart U.S., Walmart International and Sam's Club. Our fiscal year ends on January 31 for our United States (\"U.S.\") and Canadian operations. We consolidate all other operations generally using a one-month lag and on a calendar basis. Our discussion is as of and for the fiscal years ended January 31, 2017 (\"fiscal 2017 \"), January 31, 2016 (\"fiscal 2016 \") and January 31, 2015 (\"fiscal 2015 \"). During fiscal 2017 , we generated total revenues of $485.9 billion , which was primarily comprised of net sales of $481.3 billion . We maintain our principal offices at 702 S.W. 8th Street, Bentonville, Arkansas 72716, USA. Our common stock trades on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol \"WMT.\" The Development of Our Company Although Walmart was incorporated in Delaware in October 1969, the businesses conducted by our founders began in 1945 when Sam M. Walton opened a franchise Ben Franklin variety store in Newport, Arkansas. In 1946, his brother, James L. Walton, opened a similar store in Versailles, Missouri. Until 1962, our founders' business was devoted entirely to the operation of variety stores. In that year, the first Wal-Mart Discount City, which was a discount store, opened in Rogers, Arkansas. In 1983, we opened our first Sam's Club, and in 1988, we opened our first supercenter. In 1998, we opened our first Neighborhood Market. In 1991, we began our first international initiative when we entered into a joint venture in Mexico. Since then, our international presence has expanded and, as of January 31, 2017 , our Walmart International segment conducted business in 27 countries. In 2000, we began our first digital initiative by creating the walmart.com retail website. Since then, our digital presence has continued to grow. As of January 31, 2017 , we operated e-commerce websites in 11 countries, providing access to Walmart and our various brands around the world. 6 Information About Our Segments The Company is engaged in the operation of retail, wholesale and other units located throughout the U.S., Africa, Argentina, Brazil, Canada, Central America, Chile, China, India, Japan, Mexico and the United Kingdom and retail websites in the U.S. and 10 other countries. The Company's operations are conducted in three reportable segments: Walmart U.S., Walmart International and Sam's Club. The Company defines its segments as those operations whose results the chief operating decision maker (\"CODM\") regularly reviews to analyze performance and allocate resources. The Company sells similar individual products and services in each of its segments. It is impractical to segregate and identify revenues for each of these individual products and services. Walmart U.S. is our largest segment and operates retail stores in all 50 states in the U.S., Washington D.C. and Puerto Rico, with three primary store formats, as well as digital retail. Walmart U.S. generated approximately 64% of our net sales in fiscal 2017 , and of our three segments, Walmart U.S. is the largest and has historically had the highest gross profit as a percentage of net sales (\"gross profit rate\"). In addition, Walmart U.S. has historically contributed the greatest amount to the Company's net sales and operating income. Walmart International consists of operations in 27 countries outside of the U.S. and includes numerous formats divided into three major categories: retail, wholesale and other. These categories consist of numerous formats, including supercenters, supermarkets, hypermarkets, warehouse clubs (including Sam's Clubs), cash  carry, home improvement, specialty electronics, apparel stores, drug stores and convenience stores, as well as digital retail. Walmart International generated approximately 24% of our fiscal 2017 net sales. The overall gross profit rate for Walmart International is lower than that of Walmart U.S. primarily because of its merchandise mix. Walmart International is our second largest segment and has grown through acquisitions, as well as by adding retail, wholesale and other units. Sam's Club consists of membership-only warehouse clubs and operates in 47 states in the U.S. and in Puerto Rico, as well as digital retail. Sam's Club accounted for approximately 12% of our fiscal 2017 net sales. As a membership-only warehouse club, membership income is a significant component of the segment's operating income. Sam's Club operates with a lower gross profit rate and lower operating expenses as a percentage of net sales than our other segments. The Company measures the results of its segments using, among other measures, each segment's net sales and operating income, which includes certain corporate overhead allocations. From time to time, we revise the measurement of each segment's operating income, including any corporate overhead allocations, as determined by the information regularly reviewed by our CODM. When the measurement of a segment changes, previous period amounts and balances are reclassified to be comparable to the current period's presentation. Walmart U.S. Segment The Walmart U.S. segment is a mass merchandiser of consumer products, operating under the \"Walmart,\" \"Wal-Mart\" and \"Walmart Neighborhood Market\" brands, as well as walmart.com and other digital retail. The Walmart U.S. segment had net sales of $307.8 billion , $298.4 billion and $288.0 billion for fiscal 2017 , 2016 and 2015 , respectively.

The Walmart International segment operates e-commerce websites in 10 countries (Argentina, Brazil, Canada, Chile, China, India, Japan, Mexico, South Africa and the United Kingdom). Customers have access through our e-commerce websites and, in countries where available, mobile commerce applications to a broad assortment of merchandise and services, both of which vary by country. Digital retail supports our physical stores with capabilities like \"Click  Collect\" in the United Kingdom and our grocery home delivery business in Mexico. Merchandise. The merchandising strategy for the Walmart International segment is similar to that of our operations in the U.S. in terms of the breadth and scope of merchandise offered for sale. While brand name merchandise accounts for a majority of our sales, we have both leveraged U.S. private brands and developed market specific private brands to serve our customers with high quality, lower priced items. Along with the private brands we market globally, such as \"Equate,\" \"George,\" \"Great Value,\" \"Holiday Time,\" \"Mainstays,\" \"Ol' Roy\" and \"Parent's Choice,\" our international markets have developed market specific brands including \"Aurrera,\" \"Cambridge,\" \"Chosen by You,\" and \"Extra Special.\" In addition, we have developed relationships with regional and local suppliers in each market to ensure reliable sources of quality merchandise that is equal to national brands at low prices. Operations. The hours of operation for operating units in the Walmart International segment vary by country and by individual markets within countries, depending upon local and national ordinances governing hours of operation. Operating units in each country accept a variety of payment methods. Seasonal Aspects of Operations. The Walmart International segment's business is seasonal to a certain extent. Historically, the segment's highest sales volume and operating income have occurred in the fourth quarter of our fiscal year. The seasonality of the business varies by country due to different national and religious holidays, festivals and customs, as well as different weather patterns. Competition. The Walmart International segment competes with a variety of local, national and global chains in the supermarket, discount, grocery, department, drug, variety and specialty stores, hypermarkets, wholesale clubs, home improvement, specialty electronic, e-commerce and catalog businesses in each of the markets in which we operate. We also operate, on a limited basis, consumer credit operations. We compete with others for desirable sites. Our ability to develop, open and operate units at the right locations and to deliver a customer-centric experience that seamlessly integrates digital and physical shopping determines, to a large extent, our competitive position in the markets in which Walmart International operates. We believe price leadership is a critical part of our business model and we continue to focus on moving our markets towards an EDLP approach. Additionally, our ability to operate food departments effectively has a significant impact on our competitive position in the markets where we operate. In the markets in which we have retail websites or retail websites and mobile commerce applications, those websites and applications help differentiate us from our competitors and help us compete with other retailers for customers and their purchases, both in our digital and physical retail operations. 12 Distribution. We utilize a total of 176 distribution facilities located in Argentina, Brazil, Canada, Central America, Chile, China, Japan, Mexico, South Africa and the United Kingdom. Through these facilities, we process and distribute both imported and domestic products to the operating units of the Walmart International segment. During fiscal 2017 , approximately 82% of the Walmart International segment's purchases passed through these distribution facilities. Suppliers ship the balance of the Walmart International segment's purchases directly to our stores in the various markets in which we operate.

Seasonal Aspects of Operations. The Sam's Club segment's business is seasonal to a certain extent due to calendar events and national and religious holidays, as well as different weather patterns. Historically, its highest sales volume and segment operating income have occurred in the fiscal quarter ending January 31. Competition. Sam's Club competes with other membership-only warehouse clubs, the largest of which is Costco Wholesale, as well as with discount retailers, retail and wholesale grocers, general merchandise wholesalers and distributors, gasoline stations, e-commerce and catalog businesses. Sam's Club also competes with other retailers and warehouse clubs for desirable new club sites. At Sam's Club, we provide value at members-only prices, a quality merchandise assortment, and bulk sizing to serve both our Savings and Business members. Our e-commerce website and mobile commerce applications have increasingly become important factors in our ability to compete with other membership-only warehouse clubs. Distribution. During fiscal 2017 , approximately 68% of the Sam's Club segment's non-fuel purchases were shipped from the Sam's Club segment's 25 dedicated distribution facilities located strategically throughout the U.S., or from some of the Walmart U.S. segment's distribution facilities, which service the Sam's Club segment for certain items.

Other Segment Information Certain financial information relating to our segments is included in our Annual Report to Shareholders for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2017 (\"Annual Report to Shareholders\") under the caption \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\" and in Note 14 in the \"Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\" included therein, which information is incorporated herein by reference. Note 14 also includes information regarding total revenues and long-lived assets aggregated by our U.S. and non-U.S. operations. Such portions of the Annual Report to Shareholders are included as Exhibit 13 to this Annual Report on Form 10-K and incorporated by reference herein as expressly provided herein. Intellectual Property We regard our trademarks, service marks, copyrights, patents, domain names, trade dress, trade secrets, proprietary technologies, and similar intellectual property as important to our success, and with respect to our associates, customers and others, we rely on trademark, copyright, and patent law, trade-secret protection, and confidentiality and/or license agreements to protect our proprietary rights. We have registered, or applied for the registration of, a number of U.S. and international domain names, trademarks, service marks, and copyrights. Additionally, we have filed U.S. and international patent applications covering certain of our proprietary technology. We have licensed in the past, and expect that we may license in the future, certain of our proprietary rights to third parties. Suppliers and Supply Chain As a retailer and warehouse club operator, we utilize a global supply chain that includes over 100,000 suppliers located around the world, including in the United States, from whom we purchase the merchandise that we sell in our stores, clubs and online. In many instances, we purchase merchandise from producers located near the stores and clubs in which such merchandise will be sold, particularly products in the \"fresh\" category. Our purchases may represent a significant percentage of a number of our suppliers' annual sales, and the volume of product we acquire from many suppliers allows us to obtain favorable pricing from such suppliers. Our suppliers are subject to standards of conduct, including requirements that they comply with local labor laws, local worker safety laws and other applicable laws. Our ability to acquire from our suppliers the assortment and volume of products we wish to offer to our customer, to receive those products within the required time through our supply chain and to distribute those products to our stores and clubs determines, in part, our in-stock levels in our stores and clubs and the attractiveness of our merchandise assortment we offer to our customers and members. Employees As of the end of fiscal 2017 , the Company and its subsidiaries employed approximately 2.3 million employees (\"associates\") worldwide, with nearly 1.5 million associates in the U.S. and 0.8 million associates internationally. Similar to other retailers, the Company has a large number of part-time, hourly or non-exempt associates and a large number of associates turn over each year. We believe our relationships with our associates are good. On February 19, 2015, the Company announced a significant initiative on pay and training for U.S. associates. Approximately 500,000 full-time and part-time associates at Walmart U.S. stores and Sam's Clubs received pay raises in the first half of fiscal 2016, and in February 2016, approximately 1.2 million full-time and part-time associates at Walmart U.S. stores and Sam's Clubs received pay increases. Also included in the announcement were comprehensive changes to our hiring, training, compensation and scheduling programs, as well as to our store management structure. These changes give our U.S. associates the opportunity to earn higher pay and advance in their careers. Certain information relating to retirement-related benefits we provide to our associates is included in our Annual Report to Shareholders in Note 12 in the \"Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\" included therein, which information is incorporated herein by reference. In addition to retirement-related benefits, in the U.S., the Company offers a broad range of Company-paid benefits to our associates, including store discount cards or Sam's Club memberships, bonuses based on Company performance, matching a portion of purchases of our stock by associates through our Associate Stock Purchase Plan and life insurance. The Company also offers health-care benefits to eligible full-time and part-time associates in the U.S. The Company's medical plan in the U.S. has no lifetime maximum benefit for most expenses. Similarly, in the operations outside the U.S., the Company provides a variety of associate benefits that vary based on customary local practices and statutory requirements.

RISK FACTORS ##TABLE_ENDThe risks described below could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. Our business operations could also be affected by additional factors that apply to all companies operating in the U.S. and globally. Strategic Risks General or macro-economic factors, both domestically and internationally, may materially adversely affect our financial performance. General economic conditions and other economic factors, globally or in one or more of the markets we serve, may adversely affect our financial performance. Higher interest rates, lower or higher prices of petroleum products, including crude oil, natural gas, gasoline, and diesel fuel, higher costs for electricity and other energy, weakness in the housing market, inflation, deflation, increased costs of essential services, such as medical care and utilities, higher levels of unemployment, decreases in consumer disposable income, unavailability of consumer credit, higher consumer debt levels, changes in consumer spending and shopping patterns, fluctuations in currency exchange rates, higher tax rates, imposition of new taxes and surcharges or other changes in tax laws, changes in healthcare laws, other regulatory changes, the imposition of measures that create barriers to or increase the costs associated with international trade, overall economic slowdown and other economic factors in the U.S. or in any of the other markets in which we operate could adversely affect consumer demand for the products we sell in the U.S. or such other markets, change the mix of products we sell to one with a lower average gross margin, cause a slowdown in discretionary purchases of goods, adversely affect our net sales and result in slower inventory turnover and greater markdowns of inventory, or otherwise materially adversely affect our operations and operating results. In addition, the economic factors listed above, any other economic factors or circumstances resulting in higher transportation, labor, insurance or healthcare costs or commodity prices, and other economic factors in the U.S. and other countries in which we operate can increase our cost of sales and operating, selling, general and administrative expenses and otherwise materially adversely affect our operations and operating results. The economic factors that affect our operations may also adversely affect the operations of our suppliers, which can result in an increase in the cost to us of the goods we sell to our customers or, in more extreme cases, in certain suppliers not producing goods in the volume typically available to us for sale. We may not timely identify or effectively respond to consumer trends or preferences, which could negatively affect our relationship with our customers, demand for the products and services we sell, our market share and the growth of our business. It is difficult to predict consistently and successfully the products and services our customers will demand and changes in their shopping patterns. The success of our business depends in part on how accurately we predict consumer demand, availability of merchandise, the related impact on the demand for existing products and the competitive environment, whether for customers purchasing products at our stores and clubs, through our digital retail businesses or through the combination of both retail offerings. Price transparency, assortment of products, customer experience, convenience and the speed and cost of shipping are of primary importance to customers and continue to increase in importance, particularly as a result of digital tools and social media available to consumers and the choices available to consumers for purchasing products. As a result of these factors, we 17 plan to increase investments in e-commerce, technology, store remodels and other customer initiatives, moderate the number of new store openings and rely to a greater extent on comparable store sales and e-commerce for growth. Any failure of these investments or initiatives to adequately or effectively respond to changing consumer tastes, preferences and shopping patterns, or any other failure on our part to timely identify or effectively respond to changing consumer tastes, preferences and shopping patterns could negatively affect our relationship with our customers, the demand for the products we sell, our market share and the growth of our business. We face strong competition from other retailers and wholesale club operators (whether through physical retail, digital retail or the integration of both), which could materially adversely affect our financial performance. The retail business is highly competitive. Each of our segments competes for customers, employees, store and club sites, products and services and in other important aspects of its business with many other local, regional, national and global retailers and wholesale club operators, as well as other national and international internet-based retailers and retail intermediaries. Our Walmart U.S. segment competes with retailers operating discount, department, retail and wholesale grocers, drug, dollar, variety and specialty stores, supermarkets, supercenter-type stores and hypermarkets, as well as e-commerce and catalog businesses. Our Sam's Club segment competes with other wholesale club operators, as well as discount retailers, retail and wholesale grocers, general merchandise wholesalers and distributors, gasoline stations, and e-commerce retailers, wholesalers and catalog businesses. Internationally, we compete with retailers who operate department, drug, dollar stores, variety and specialty stores, supermarkets, supercenter-type stores, hypermarkets, wholesale clubs, home-improvement stores, specialty electronics stores, apparel stores, wholesale clubs, cash  carry operations, convenience stores and e-commerce and catalog businesses. We compete in a variety of ways, including the prices at which we sell our merchandise, merchandise selection and availability, services offered to customers, location, store hours, in-store amenities, the shopping convenience and overall shopping experience we offer, the attractiveness and ease of use of our e-commerce websites and mobile commerce applications, cost and speed of and options for delivery to customers of merchandise purchased online, through mobile commerce applications or through the integration of our physical and digital retail operations. Where necessary, to compete effectively with competitors who price merchandise at points lower than the prices we set under our EDLP philosophy, we will lower our prices on goods for sale. A failure to respond effectively to competitive pressures and changes in the retail markets could materially adversely affect our financial performance. See \" Item 1. Business \" above for additional discussion of the competitive situation of each of our reportable segments. Although the retail industry as a whole is highly fragmented, certain segments of the retail industry may undergo consolidation from time to time, which could result in increased competition and significantly alter the dynamics of the retail marketplace. Such consolidation may result in competitors with greatly improved financial resources, improved access to merchandise, greater market penetration than they previously enjoyed and other improvements in their competitive positions. Such business combinations could result in the provision of a wider variety of products and services at competitive prices by such consolidated companies, which could adversely affect our financial performance. Failure to grow our e-commerce business through the integration of physical and digital retail or otherwise, and the cost of our increasing e-commerce investments, may materially adversely affect our market position, net sales and financial performance. The retail business is quickly evolving and consumers are increasingly embracing shopping online and through mobile commerce applications. As a result, the portion of total consumer expenditures with all retailers and wholesale clubs occurring online and through mobile commerce applications is increasing and the pace of this increase could accelerate. We plan to increase our investments in e-commerce, technology, store remodels and other customer initiatives, moderate the number of new store openings and rely to a greater extent on increasing comparable store and club sales and e-commerce sales (which are included in our calculation of comparable store and club sales with the exception of e-commerce acquisitions until such businesses have been owned for 12 months) for growth. The success of this strategy will depend in large measure on our ability to build and deliver a seamless shopping experience across the physical and digital retail channels and is further subject to the risks we face as outlined in this Item 1A . Our investments in e-commerce, technology, store remodels and other customer initiatives may not adequately or effectively allow us to grow our e-commerce business, increase comparable store sales, maintain or grow our overall market position or otherwise offset the impact on the growth of our business of a moderated pace of new store and club openings. If we fail to successfully implement our strategy, our market position, net sales and financial performance could be adversely affected. In addition, a greater concentration of e-commerce sales could result in a reduction in the amount of traffic in our stores and clubs, which would, in turn, reduce the opportunities for cross-store or cross-club sales of merchandise that such traffic creates and could reduce our sales within our stores and clubs and materially adversely affect the financial performance of the physical retail side of our operations. 18 In addition, the cost of certain e-commerce and technology investments, including any operating losses incurred by acquired e-commerce businesses will adversely impact our financial performance in the short-term and may adversely impact our financial performance over the longer term. Operational Risks Natural disasters, changes in climate, and geo-political events could materially adversely affect our financial performance. The occurrence of one or more natural disasters, such as hurricanes, cyclones, typhoons, tropical storms, floods, earthquakes, tsunamis, weather conditions such as major or extended winter storms, droughts and tornadoes, whether as a result of climate change or otherwise, severe changes in climate and geo-political events, such as civil unrest or terrorist attacks in a country in which we operate or in which our suppliers are located could adversely affect our operations and financial performance. Such events could result in physical damage to, or the complete loss of, one or more of our properties, the closure of one or more stores, clubs and distribution facilities, the lack of an adequate work force in a market, the inability of customers and associates to reach or have transportation to our stores and clubs affected by such events, the evacuation of the populace from areas in which our stores, clubs and distribution facilities are located, the unavailability of our retail websites and mobile commerce applications to our customers, changes in the purchasing patterns of consumers and in consumers' disposable income, the temporary or long-term disruption in the supply of products from some local and overseas suppliers, the disruption in the transport of goods from overseas, the disruption or delay in the delivery of goods to our distribution facilities or stores within a country in which we are operating, the reduction in the availability of products in our stores, the disruption of utility services to our stores and our facilities, and disruption in our communications with our stores. These events and their impacts could otherwise disrupt and adversely affect our operations in the areas in which they occur, such as Superstorm Sandy in the U.S. in 2012 or the numerous storm systems in the U.S. in recent years, and could adversely affect our financial performance. In light of the substantial premiums payable for insurance coverage for losses caused by certain natural disasters, such as hurricanes, cyclones, typhoons, tropical storms, earthquakes, floods and tsunamis, as well as the limitations on available coverage for such losses, we have chosen to be primarily self-insured with respect to such losses. Although we maintain certain specific coverages for losses from physical damages in excess of certain amounts to guard against catastrophic losses from such causes, we still bear the risk of losses incurred as a result of any physical damage to, or the destruction of, any stores, clubs and distribution facilities, loss or spoilage of inventory, and business interruption caused by any such events to the extent they are below catastrophic levels of coverage, as well as in the event of a catastrophe, to the extent they exceed our aggregate limits of applicable coverages. Significant losses caused by such events could materially adversely affect our financial performance. Risks associated with the suppliers from whom our products are sourced could materially adversely affect our financial performance. The products we sell are sourced from a wide variety of domestic and international suppliers. Global sourcing of many of the products we sell is an important factor in our financial performance. We expect all of our suppliers to comply with applicable laws, including labor, safety and environmental laws, and to otherwise meet our required supplier standards of conduct. Our ability to find qualified suppliers who uphold our standards, and to access products in a timely and efficient manner, is a significant challenge, especially with respect to suppliers located and goods sourced outside the U.S. Political and economic instability in the countries in which our foreign suppliers and their manufacturers are located, the financial instability of suppliers, suppliers' failure to meet certain of our supplier standards (including our responsible sourcing standards), labor problems experienced by our suppliers and their manufacturers, the availability of raw materials to suppliers, merchandise safety and quality issues, disruption in the transportation of merchandise from the suppliers and manufacturers to our stores, clubs, and other facilities, including as a result of labor slowdowns at any port at which a material amount of merchandise we purchase enters into the U.S., currency exchange rates, transport availability and cost, transport security, inflation and other factors relating to the suppliers and the countries in which they are located are beyond our control. In addition, the U.S.'s foreign trade policies, tariffs and other impositions on imported goods, trade sanctions imposed on certain countries, the limitation on the importation of certain types of goods or of goods containing certain materials from other countries and other factors relating to foreign trade are beyond our control. These and other factors affecting our suppliers and our access to products could adversely affect our financial performance. If the products we sell are not safe or otherwise fail to meet our customers' expectations, we could lose customers, incur liability for any injuries suffered by customers using or consuming a product we sell or otherwise experience material adverse effects to our brand, reputation and financial performance. Our customers count on us to provide them with safe products. Concerns regarding the safety of food and non-food products that we source from our suppliers or that we prepare and then sell could cause customers to avoid purchasing certain products from us, or to seek alternative sources of supply for all of their food and non-food needs, even if the basis for the concern is 19 outside of our control. Any lost confidence on the part of our customers would be difficult and costly to reestablish. As such, any issue regarding the safety of any food or non-food items we sell, regardless of the cause, could adversely affect our brand, reputation and financial performance. We rely extensively on information systems to process transactions, summarize results and manage our business. Disruptions in both our primary and secondary (back-up) systems could harm our ability to conduct our operations. Although we have independent, redundant and physically separate primary and secondary information systems, given the number of individual transactions we have each year, it is critical that we maintain uninterrupted operation of our business-critical information systems. Our information systems, including our back-up systems, are subject to damage or interruption from power outages, computer and telecommunications failures, computer viruses, worms, other malicious computer programs, denial-of-service attacks, security breaches (through cyber-attacks from cyber-attackers and sophisticated organizations), catastrophic events such as fires, tornadoes, earthquakes and hurricanes, and usage errors by our associates. Our information systems are essential to our business operations, including the processing of transactions, management of our associates, facilities, logistics, inventories, physical stores and clubs and our online operations. If our information systems and our back-up systems are damaged, breached or cease to function properly, we may have to make a significant investment to repair or replace them, and we may suffer interruptions in our business operations in the interim. Any interruption in both our information systems and back-up systems may have a material adverse effect on our business or results of operations. In addition, we are pursuing complex initiatives to transform our information technology processes and systems. The risk of system disruption is increased when significant system changes are undertaken, although we believe our change management process will mitigate this risk. If we fail to integrate our information systems and processes, we may fail to realize the cost savings anticipated to be derived from these initiatives. If the technology-based systems that give our customers the ability to shop with us online do not function effectively, our operating results, as well as our ability to grow our e-commerce business globally, could be materially adversely affected. Many of our customers shop with us over our e-commerce websites and mobile commerce applications, which are a part of our multi-channel sales strategy. Increasingly, customers are using computers, tablets, and smart phones to shop online and through mobile commerce applications with us and with our competitors and to do comparison shopping. We use social media and electronic mail to interact with our customers and as a means to enhance their shopping experience. As a part of our multi-channel sales strategy, in addition to home delivery, we offer \"Walmart Pickup,\" \"Pickup Today\" and \"Club Pickup\" and in a growing number of locations, \"Online Grocery\" programs under which many products available for purchase online can be picked up by the customer at a local Walmart store or Sam's Club, which provides additional customer traffic at such stores and clubs. Multi-channel retailing is a rapidly evolving part of the retail industry and of our operations in the U.S. and in a number of markets in which our Walmart International segment operates. We must anticipate and meet our customers' changing expectations while adjusting for technology investments and developments in our competitors' operations through focusing on the building and delivery of a seamless shopping experience across all channels by each operating segment. Any failure on our part to provide attractive, user-friendly secure e-commerce platforms that offer a wide assortment of merchandise at competitive prices and with low cost and rapid delivery options and that continually meet the changing expectations of online shoppers and developments in online and mobile commerce application merchandising and related technology could place us at a competitive disadvantage, result in the loss of e-commerce and other sales, harm our reputation with customers, have a material adverse impact on the growth of our e-commerce business globally and have a material adverse impact on our business and results of operations. Our e-commerce websites and mobile commerce applications, which are increasingly important to our business and continue to grow in complexity and scope, and the computer systems and operating systems on which they run, including those applications and systems in our acquired e-commerce businesses, may be subject to cyber-attacks. Those attacks could involve attempts to gain access to the website or mobile commerce application to obtain and make unauthorized use of customers' or members' payment information and related risks discussed below. Such attacks, if successful, can also create denials of service or otherwise disable, degrade or sabotage one or more of our retail websites or mobile commerce applications and otherwise significantly disrupt our customers' and members' shopping experience on any of our retail website or mobile commerce applications. If we are unable to maintain the security of our retail commerce websites and mobile commerce applications and keep them operating within acceptable parameters, we could suffer loss of sales, reductions in traffic, reputational damage and deterioration of our competitive position and incur liability for any damage to customers whose personal information is unlawfully obtained and used, any of which events could have a material adverse impact on our business and results of operations and impede the execution of our strategy for the growth of our business. 20 Any failure to maintain the security of the information relating to our company, customers, members, associates and vendors, whether as a result of cybersecurity attacks on our information systems or otherwise, could damage our reputation, result in litigation or other legal actions against us, cause us to incur substantial additional costs, and materially adversely affect our business and operating results. As do most retailers, we receive and store in our digital information systems certain personal information about our customers and members, and we receive and store personal information concerning our associates and vendors. Some of that information is stored digitally in connection with our e-commerce websites and mobile commerce applications. We also utilize third-party service providers for a variety of reasons, including, without limitation, for encryption and authentication technology, content delivery to customers and members, back-office support, and other functions. Such providers may have access to information we hold about our customers, members, associates or vendors. In addition, our online operations depend upon the secure transmission of confidential information over public networks, including information permitting cashless payments. Cyber threats are rapidly evolving and those threats and the means for obtaining access to information in digital and other storage media are becoming increasingly sophisticated. Cyber threats and cyber-attackers can be sponsored by countries or sophisticated criminal organizations or be the work of single \"hackers\" or small groups of \"hackers.\" Each year, cyber-attackers make numerous attempts to access the information stored in our information systems. We have in place substantial security measures to protect, and to prevent unauthorized access to, our information systems and the information stored on such systems. We also have security processes, protocols and standards that are applicable to our third-party service providers, including cloud service providers, to protect information from our systems which they have access to or hold under their engagements with us. We constantly monitor developments in cyber threats, evaluate the effectiveness of our information security measures and change such measures or implement new and additional security measures from time to time to address new and different risks to the security of such information and to strengthen our protections for the information stored on our systems. We require our third-party service providers to do the same. Nevertheless, as cyber threats evolve, change and become more difficult to detect and successfully defend against, one or more cyber-attacks might defeat our or a third-party service provider's security measures in the future and obtain the personal information of customers, members, associates and vendors. Associate error or malfeasance, faulty password management or other irregularities may also result in a defeat of our or our third-party service providers' security measures and a breach of our or their information systems. Moreover, hardware, software or applications we use may have inherent defects of design, manufacture or operations or could be inadvertently or intentionally implemented or used in a manner that could compromise information security. We or our third-party service providers may not discover any security breach and loss of information for a significant period of time after the security breach occurs. Any breach of our security measures or any breach, error or malfeasance of those of our third-party service providers and loss of our confidential information, or any failure by us to comply with applicable privacy and information security laws and regulations, could cause us to incur significant costs to protect any customers, members, associates and vendors whose personal data was compromised and to restore their confidence in us and to make changes to our information systems and administrative processes to address security issues and compliance with applicable laws and regulations. In addition, such events could be widely publicized and could materially adversely affect our reputation with our customers, members, associates, vendors and shareholders, as well as our operations, net sales, results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and liquidity, could result in the release to the public of confidential information about our operations and financial condition and performance and could result in litigation or other legal actions against us or the imposition of penalties, fines, fees or liabilities, which may not be covered by our insurance policies. Moreover, a security breach could require us to devote significant management resources to address the problems created by the security breach and to expend significant additional resources to upgrade further the security measures we employ to guard personal information against cyber-attacks and other attempts to access such information and could result in a disruption of our operations, particularly our digital retail operations. We accept payments using a variety of methods, including cash, checks, credit and debit cards, our private label credit cards and gift cards, and we may offer new payment options over time, which may have information security risk implications. As a retailer accepting debit and credit cards for payment, we are subject to various industry data protection standards and protocols, such as the American National Standards Institute encryption standards and payment network security operating guidelines and the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard. Even though we comply with these standards and protocols and other information security measures, we cannot be certain that the security measures we maintain to protect all of our information technology systems are able to prevent, contain or detect any cyber-attacks, cyber terrorism, or security breaches from known cyber-attacks or malware that may be developed in the future. To the extent that any cyber-attack or incursion in our or one of our third-party service provider's information systems results in the loss, damage or misappropriation of information, we may be materially adversely affected by claims from customers, financial institutions, regulatory authorities, payment card networks and others. In certain circumstances, payment card association rules and obligations to which we are subject under our contracts with payment card processors make us liable to payment card issuers if information in connection with payment cards and payment card transactions that we hold is compromised, which liabilities could be substantial. In addition, the cost of 21 complying with stricter and more complex data privacy, data collection and information security laws and standards could be significant to us. Changes in the results of our retail pharmacy business could adversely affect our overall results of operations, cash flows and liquidity. The retail pharmacy operations in our Walmart U.S. and Sam's Club segments generate substantial net sales, a large majority of which are generated by filling prescriptions for which we receive payment established through contractual relationship with third-party payers and payment administrators, such as private insurers, governmental agencies and pharmacy benefit managers (\"PBMs\"). Our retail pharmacy operations are subject to numerous risks, including: reductions in the third-party reimbursement rates for drugs; changes in our payer mix (i.e., shifts in the relative distribution of our pharmacy customers across drug insurance plans and programs toward plans and programs with less favorable reimbursement terms); changes in third party payer drug formularies (i.e., the schedule of prescription drugs approved for reimbursement or which otherwise receive preferential coverage treatment); growth in, and our participation in or exclusion from, exclusive and preferred pharmacy network arrangements operated by PBMs and/or any insurance plan or program; increases in the prices we pay for brand name and generic prescription drugs we sell; increases in the administrative burden associated with seeking third-party reimbursement; changes in the frequency with which new brand name pharmaceuticals become available to consumers; introduction of lower cost generic drugs as substitutes for existing brand name drugs for which there was no prior generic drug competition; changes in drug mix (i.e., the relative distribution of drugs customers purchase at our pharmacies between brands and generics); changes in the health insurance market generally; changes in the scope of or the elimination of Medicare Part D or Medicaid drug programs; increased competition from other retail pharmacy operations; further consolidation among third party payers, PBMs or purchasers of drugs; overall economic conditions and the ability of our pharmacy customers to pay for drugs prescribed for them to the extent the costs are not reimbursed by a third party; failure to meet any performance or incentive thresholds to which our level of third party reimbursement may be subject; and changes in the regulatory environment for the retail pharmacy industry and the pharmaceutical industry, including as a result of restrictions on the further implementation of or the repeal of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act or the enactment and implementation of a law replacing such act, and other changes in laws, rules and regulations that affect our retail pharmacy business. If the supply of certain pharmaceuticals provided by one or more of vendors were to be disrupted for any reason, our pharmacy operations could be severely affected until at least such time as we could obtain a new supplier for such pharmaceuticals. Any such disruption could cause reputational damage and result in a significant number of our pharmacy customers transferring their prescriptions to other pharmacies. One or a combination of such factors may adversely affect the volumes of brand name and generic pharmaceuticals we sell, our cost of sales associated with our retail pharmacy operations, and the net sales and gross margin of those operations, result in the loss of cross-store or -club selling opportunities and, in turn, adversely affect our overall net sales, other results of operations, cash flows and liquidity. Our failure to attract and retain qualified associates, increases in wage and benefit costs, changes in laws and other labor issues could materially adversely affect our financial performance. Our ability to continue to conduct and expand our operations depends on our ability to attract and retain a large and growing number of qualified associates globally. Our ability to meet our labor needs, including our ability to find qualified personnel to fill positions that become vacant at our existing stores, clubs and distribution centers, while controlling our associate wage and related labor costs, is generally subject to numerous external factors, including the availability of a sufficient number of qualified persons in the work force of the markets in which we operate, unemployment levels within those markets, prevailing wage rates, changing demographics, health and other insurance costs and adoption of new or revised employment and labor laws and regulations. If we are unable to locate, to attract or to retain qualified personnel, the quality of service we provide to our customers may decrease and our financial performance may be adversely affected. The wage increases for over 500,000 associates in our operations in the U.S. and investment in other initiatives for our associates in the U.S. that we announced in February 2015, and related wage increases for 1.2 million associates occurring in February 2016 have increased our wage and other labor expenses significantly. If we cannot offset the increases in our wage and other labor expenses resulting from those wage increases by increasing our gross profit, achieving decreases in our operating, selling, general and administrative expense or a combination of both, our consolidated operating income and our consolidated income from continuing operations could continue to be less than our consolidated operating income and consolidated income from continuing operations for our fiscal years prior to fiscal 2017. In addition, if our costs of labor or related costs increase even more significantly for other reasons or if new or revised labor laws, rules or regulations or healthcare laws are adopted or implemented that further increase our labor costs, our financial performance could be materially adversely affected. 22 Impediments to the expansion of our Walmart International operations, and the performance of strategic alliances to support the expansion of that segment, could materially adversely affect our financial performance. Our business strategy for our Walmart International segment includes opening new units and growing comparable stores sales in the countries in which we have existing operations. Our ability to open new units or to expand or relocate existing units depends in large measure upon our ability to locate, hire and retain qualified personnel and acquire new store sites on acceptable terms. Local laws can affect our ability to acquire attractive pre-existing buildings in which to locate units or sites on which to build new units or to expand existing units. In addition, access to local suppliers of certain types of goods may limit our ability to add new units or to expand product selections in existing units in certain markets, especially in those markets in which consumers desire to purchase locally produced goods. Economic, business and legal environments in foreign markets may also limit our ability to expand our operations and increase our net sales in those markets as we may want and could result in the closure of existing units in such markets which may adversely impact our financial results. If we cannot effectively continue to expand our Walmart International segment through opening new units, growing comparable store sales or selective acquisitions, our ability to grow our business could be adversely affected. Our Walmart International segment may also enter into strategic alliances in the countries in which we have existing operations or in other markets to expand our digital retail operations, physical retail operations or both. For example, in fiscal 2017, we entered into a strategic alliance with JD.com, Inc. providing for Walmart China to be a preferred retailer on its online-to-offline platform and our Sam's Club business in China to be a flagship store on its marketplace. Any strategic alliance may not generate the level of e-commerce or other sales we anticipate when entering into that alliance or may otherwise adversely impact our business relative to the results we could have achieved in the absence of such alliance. In addition, any investment we make in connection with a strategic alliance, such as our investment in JD.com, Inc., could materially adversely affect our financial performance. Financial Risks Fluctuations in foreign exchange rates may materially adversely affect our financial performance and our reported results of operations. Our operations in countries other than the U.S. are conducted primarily in the local currencies of those countries. Our consolidated financial statements are denominated in U.S. dollars, and to prepare those financial statements we must translate the amounts of the assets, liabilities, net sales, other revenues and expenses of our operations outside of the U.S. from local currencies into U.S. dollars using exchange rates for the current period. In recent years, fluctuations in currency exchange rates that were unfavorable to us coupled with such translations have had a material adverse effect on our reported results of operations. As a result of such translations, fluctuations in currency exchange rates from period-to-period that are unfavorable to us may also result in our consolidated financial statements reflecting significant adverse period-over-period changes in our financial performance or reflecting a period-over-period improvement in our financial performance that is not as robust as it would be without such fluctuations in the currency exchange rates. Such unfavorable currency exchange rate fluctuations will adversely affect the reported performance of our Walmart International operating segment and have a corresponding adverse effect on our reported consolidated results of operations. We may pay for products we purchase for sale in our stores and clubs around the world with a currency other than the local currency of the country in which the goods will be sold. When we must acquire the currency to pay for such products and the exchange rates for the payment currency fluctuate in a manner unfavorable to us, our cost of sales may increase and we may be unable or unwilling to change the prices at which we sell those goods to address that increase in our costs, with a corresponding adverse effect on our gross profit. Consequently, fluctuations in currency exchange rates may adversely affect our results of operations. 23 Failure to meet market expectations for our financial performance could adversely affect the market price and volatility of our stock. We believe that the price of our stock generally reflects high market expectations for our future operating results. Any failure to meet or delay in meeting these expectations, including our comparable store and club sales growth rates, e-commerce growth rates, gross margin, or earnings and earnings per share could cause the market price of our stock to decline, as could changes in our dividend or stock repurchase programs or policies. Legal, Tax, Regulatory, Compliance, Reputational and Other Risks Our operations subject us to legislative, judicial, accounting, legal, regulatory, tax, political and economic risks and conditions specific to the countries or regions in which we operate, which could materially adversely affect our business or financial performance. In addition to our U.S. operations, we operate our retail business principally through wholly-owned subsidiaries in Argentina, Brazil, Canada, Chile, China, India, Japan and the United Kingdom and our majority-owned subsidiaries in Africa, Central America and Mexico. In fiscal 2017, our Walmart U.S. and Sam's Club operating segments generated approximately 76% of our consolidated net sales. The Federal Government has created the potential for significant changes in trade policies, including tariffs and government regulations affecting trade between the U.S. and other countries where we source many of the products we sell in our stores and clubs. Potential changes which have been discussed include the renegotiation or termination of trade agreements, the imposition of higher tariffs on imports into the U.S. and the imposition of a border tax, or a border adjustment tax, on imports into the U.S. A significant portion of the general merchandise we sell in our U.S. stores and clubs is manufactured in other countries. Any such actions could increase the cost to us of such merchandise (whether imported directly or indirectly) and cause increases in the prices at which we sell such merchandise to our customers, which could materially adversely affect the financial performance of our U.S. operations and our business. During fiscal 2017 , our Walmart International operations generated approximately 24% of our consolidated net sales. Our operating segments also source goods and services from other countries. Our future operating results in these countries could be negatively affected by a variety of factors, most of which are beyond our control. These factors include political conditions, including political instability, local and global economic conditions, legal and regulatory constraints, local product safety and environmental laws, tax regulations, local labor laws, anti-money laundering laws and regulations, trade policies, currency regulations, and other matters in any of the countries or regions in which we operate, now or in the future. The potential imposition by the U.S. of a border tax or border adjustment tax, new or higher tariffs or other restrictions on trade discussed above which impact a country in which we have operations could result in actions by that country to impose new, or increase existing tariffs or taxes on products imported into such country from the U.S. or elsewhere and could damage the reputations of U.S.-based companies, including us, with customers and others in that country. This could materially adversely affect the financial performance of our operations in such country or countries. Our business and results of operations in the UK may be negatively affected by fluctuations in currency exchange rates, increases in food costs, changes in trade policies, or changes in labor, immigration, tax or other laws resulting from the UK's anticipated exit from the European Union. Brazilian federal, state and local laws are complex and subject to varying interpretations. Although the Company believes it complies with those laws, the Company's subsidiaries in Brazil are party to a large number of labor claims and non-income tax assessments, which have arisen during the normal course of business in Brazil. These matters are subject to inherent uncertainties and if decided adversely to the Company, could materially adversely affect our financial performance. The economies of some of the countries in which we have operations have in the past suffered from high rates of inflation and currency devaluations, which, if they occurred again, could adversely affect our financial performance. Other factors which may impact our international operations include foreign trade, monetary and fiscal policies of the U.S. and of other countries, laws, regulations and other activities of foreign governments, agencies and similar organizations, and risks associated with having numerous facilities located in countries which have historically been less stable than the U.S. Additional risks inherent in our international operations generally include, among others, the costs and difficulties of managing international operations, adverse tax consequences and greater difficulty in enforcing intellectual property rights in countries other than the U.S. The various risks inherent in doing business in the U.S. generally also exist when doing business outside of the U.S., and may be exaggerated by the difficulty of doing business in numerous sovereign jurisdictions due to differences in culture, laws and regulations. In foreign countries in which we have operations, a risk exists that our associates, contractors or agents could, in contravention of our policies, engage in business practices prohibited by U.S. laws and regulations applicable to us, such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (\"FCPA\"), or the laws and regulations of other countries, such as the UK Bribery Act. We maintain policies prohibiting such business practices and have in place enhanced global anti-corruption compliance programs designed to ensure compliance with these laws and regulations. Nevertheless, we remain subject to the risk that one or more of our 24 associates, contractors or agents, including those based in or from countries where practices that violate such U.S. laws and regulations or the laws and regulations of other countries may be customary, will engage in business practices that are prohibited by our policies, circumvent our compliance programs and, by doing so, violate such laws and regulations. Any such violations, even if prohibited by our internal policies, could adversely affect our business or financial performance and our reputation. We are also subject to income taxes and other taxes in both the U.S. and the foreign jurisdictions in which we currently operate or have historically operated. The U.S. Congress and the current federal administration have identified federal tax reform as a priority for 2017. Federal tax reform plans under consideration may result in significant changes to the U.S. tax code. Some of the changes contemplated by the U.S. Congress, like the border tax or border adjustment tax, could have the effect of increasing our effective tax rate, the amount of our consolidated net taxable income subject to income taxes, and our overall tax liability, and could reduce our net income and our earnings per share, as well as our consolidated cash flows and liquidity, even if the changes include a reduction in the rate at which corporate taxable income is taxed. In addition, the determination of our worldwide provision for income taxes and current and deferred tax assets and liabilities requires judgment and estimation. Our income taxes could also be materially adversely affected by earnings being lower than anticipated in jurisdictions that have lower statutory tax rates and higher than anticipated in jurisdictions that have higher statutory tax rates, by changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities, or by changes in worldwide tax laws, regulations, or accounting principles. We are subject to regular review and audit by both domestic and foreign tax authorities as well as subject to the prospective and retrospective effects of changing tax regulations and legislation. Although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, the ultimate tax outcome may materially differ from the tax amounts recorded in our consolidated financial statements and may materially affect our income tax provision, net income, or cash flows in the period or periods for which such determination and settlement is made. We are subject to certain legal proceedings that may materially adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. We are involved in a number of legal proceedings, which include consumer, employment, tort and other litigation. In particular, we are currently a defendant in a number of cases containing class-action allegations in which the plaintiffs have brought claims under federal and state wage and hour laws, as well as a number of cases containing class-action allegations in which the plaintiffs have brought claims under federal and state consumer laws. In addition, ASDA Stores, Ltd. (\"ASDA\"), a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, has been named as a defendant in nearly 10,000 \"equal value\" claims pending in the Manchester Employment Tribunal (the \"Employment Tribunal\") in the United Kingdom. The claimants, who are current and former ASDA store employees, allege that the work performed by female employees in ASDA's retail stores is of equal value in terms of, among other things, the demands of their jobs to that of male employees working in ASDA's warehouses and distribution facilities, and that the disparity in pay between these different job positions is not objectively justified. The claimants are seeking differential back pay based on higher wage rates in the warehouses and distribution facilities and higher wage rates on a prospective basis. At present, we cannot predict the number of such claims that may be filed, and cannot reasonably estimate any loss or range of loss that may arise from these proceedings. We discuss this case and other litigation to which we are party below under the caption \" Item 3. Legal Proceedings \" and in Note 10 in the \"Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements,\" which are part of our Annual Report to Shareholders, which are incorporated by reference in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and are included as an exhibit to this Annual Report on Form 10-K. We could be subject to liability, penalties and other sanctions and other adverse consequences arising out of our on-going FCPA matter. The Audit Committee of our Board of Directors has been conducting an internal investigation into, among other things, alleged violations of the FCPA and other alleged crimes or misconduct in connection with certain of our foreign subsidiaries, including Wal-Mart de Mxico, S.A.B. de C.V. (\"Walmex\"), and whether prior allegations of such violations and/or misconduct were appropriately handled by the Company. We have also been conducting a voluntary global review of our policies, practices and internal controls for anti-corruption compliance and are engaged in strengthening our global anti-corruption compliance programs. Since the implementation of the global review and enhanced anti-corruption compliance programs, the Audit Committee and we have identified or been made aware of additional allegations regarding potential violations of the FCPA. Inquiries or investigations regarding allegations of potential FCPA violations have been commenced in a number of foreign markets in which we operate, including, but not limited to, Brazil, China and India. In November 2011, we voluntarily disclosed our investigative activity to the U.S. Department of Justice (the \"DOJ\") and the SEC. We have been cooperating with those agencies and discussions have begun with them regarding the resolution of these matters. As discussions regarding resolution are preliminary, we cannot currently predict the timing, the outcome or the impact of a possible resolution of these matters. A number of federal and local government agencies in Mexico have also initiated investigations of these matters. Furthermore, lawsuits relating to the matters under investigation have been filed by several of our shareholders against us, certain of our current and former directors and officers and certain of Walmex's current and former officers. 25 We could be exposed to a variety of negative consequences as a result of these matters. One or more enforcement actions could be instituted in respect of the matters that are the subject of some or all of the on-going government investigations, and such actions, if brought, may result in judgments, settlements, fines, penalties, injunctions, cease and desist orders, debarment or other relief, criminal convictions and/or penalties. The shareholder lawsuits may result in judgments against us and our current and former directors and officers named in those proceedings. We also expect that there will be ongoing media and governmental interest regarding these matters, including additional news articles on these matters that could impact the perception of our role as a corporate citizen among certain audiences. Moreover, we have incurred and expect to continue to incur costs in responding to requests for information or subpoenas seeking documents, testimony and other information in connection with the government investigations, in defending the shareholder lawsuits and in conducting our review and investigations. While we believe it is probable we will incur a loss from these matters, given the on-going nature and complexity of the review, inquiries and investigations we cannot yet reasonably estimate a loss or range of loss that may arise from the conclusion of these matters. Although we do not presently believe that these matters will have a material adverse effect on our business, given the inherent uncertainties in such situations, we can provide no assurance that these matters will not be material to our business in the future. ##TABLE_START ", "1B": " ITEM 1B.

II. CERTAIN OTHER PROCEEDINGS: The Company is a defendant in several lawsuits in which the complaints closely track the allegations set forth in a news story that appeared in The New York Times ( the \" Times \" ) on April 21, 2012. One of these is a securities lawsuit that was filed on May 7, 2012, in the United States District Court for the Middle District of Tennessee, and subsequently transferred to the Western District of Arkansas, in which the plaintiff alleges various violations of the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (the \"FCPA\") beginning in 2005, and asserts violations of Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, relating to certain prior disclosures of the Company. The plaintiff seeks to represent a class of shareholders who purchased or acquired stock of the Company between December 8, 2011, and April 20, 2012, and seeks damages and other relief based on allegations that the defendants' conduct affected the value of such stock. On September 20, 2016, the court granted plaintiff's motion for class certification. On October 6, 2016, the defendants filed a petition to appeal the class certification ruling to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit. On November 7, 2016, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit denied the Company's petition. In addition, a number of derivative complaints have been filed in Delaware and Arkansas, also tracking the allegations of the Times story, and naming various current and former officers and directors as additional defendants. The plaintiffs in the derivative suits (in which the Company is a nominal defendant) allege, among other things, that the defendants who are or were directors or officers of the Company breached their fiduciary duties in connection with their oversight of FCPA compliance. All of the derivative suits have been combined into two consolidated proceedings, one of which was consolidated in the United States District Court for the Western District of Arkansas and the other in the Delaware Court of Chancery. On March 31, 2015, the Western District of Arkansas granted the defendants' motion to dismiss the consolidated derivative proceedings in that court. On April 15, 2015, plaintiffs filed their notice of appeal with the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit. On July 22, 2016, the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit affirmed the dismissal of the consolidated derivative proceedings in Arkansas. There was no appeal from that ruling. On May 13, 2016, the Delaware Court of Chancery granted the defendants' motion to dismiss the consolidated derivative proceedings in that court. On June 10, 2016, plaintiffs in the Delaware consolidated derivative proceedings filed their notice of appeal to the Delaware Supreme Court. On January 18, 2017, the Delaware Supreme Court remanded those proceedings to the Court of Chancery for further briefing and an additional ruling on due process issues raised by the plaintiffs, before the Delaware Supreme Court renders its ultimate decision on the appeal. Management does not believe any possible loss or the range of any possible loss that may be incurred in connection with these proceedings will be material to the Company's financial condition or results of operations.

Delaware Derivative Litigation, Delaware Ct. of Chancery, 4/25/12; Delaware Supreme Court, Dover, DE; 6/10/16. 28 III. ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS: Item 103 of SEC Regulation S-K requires disclosure of certain environmental matters. The following matters are disclosed in accordance with that requirement. For the matters listed below, management does not believe any possible loss or the range of any possible loss that may be incurred in connection with each matter, individually or in the aggregate, will be material to the Company's financial condition or results of operations. In November and December 2016, the Environmental and Natural History Ministry of Chiapas, Mexico (\"Ministry\") notified a subsidiary of the Company, Arrendadora de Centros Comerciales, S. de R.L. de C.V. (\"Arrendadora\"), that it was proposing aggregated penalties approximating $430,000 in respect to four stores which the Ministry believed may have been constructed without first obtaining a required environmental impact license. Arrendadora has challenged the penalties before an administrative court and the trials are in process. The Ministry had previously proposed penalties of approximately $640,000 related to this matter in 2014, but Arrendadora was released by an administrative court from payment of such penalties on the basis that the Ministry had failed to comply with legal formalities in connection with their imposition. In November 2016, the state environmental agency in Santa Catarina, Brazil imposed aggregate penalties of approximately $180,000 against WMS Supermercados do Brasil Ltda (\"Walmart Brazil\") related to the fuel station at its store in Posto Cambori. Such amount includes penalties related to a fuel tank leak and for operation of the fuel station in non-compliance with its license from 2009-2013 and without a license commencing in 2013. These matters had been self-reported by Walmart Brazil to the environmental agency following an internal licensure review. Walmart Brazil has filed its defense with the agency against the imposition of these penalties as well as its remediation plans and has been monitoring the underground water for contamination. Following the filing of that defense, in March 2017 the environmental agency reduced the aggregate penalties to approximately $90,000 which amount has been paid by Walmart Brazil. During fiscal year 2015, a California Greenwashing Task Force informed the Company that it was investigating whether the Company had violated a California statute that prohibits the sale of plastic products labeled by the Company's suppliers as \"biodegradable\" or \"compostable.\" In January 2017, the Company entered into a settlement agreement under which it agreed to pay approximately $950,000. The Company also agreed to abide by a permanent injunction requiring compliance with California's laws related to the sale of products labeled \"biodegradable,\" \"degradable,\" \"compostable,\" or \"decomposable.\" On April 23, 2015, Wal-Mart Transportation LLC, a subsidiary of the Company, received a Finding and Notice of Violation from the Environmental Protection Agency alleging that Walmart Transportation violated the California Air Resources Board's Truck and Bus regulations by failing to install particulate matter filters on some diesel fueled vehicles. The Company responded and is in settlement negotiations with the agency. On April 6, 2015, representatives for the Brazilian Institute of the Environment alleged that Walmart Brazil had failed to file required reports documenting the number of tires imported, sold and recycled. The agency proposed a penalty of approximately $857,000, which may be doubled and excludes additional amounts in respect of inflation and interest, and prohibited Walmart Brazil from selling or importing tires until the matter is resolved. In October 2015, Walmart Brazil filed its defense with the agency against the imposition of this penalty. In April 2013, a subsidiary of the Company, Corporacion de Compaias Agroindustriales, operating in Costa Rica, became aware that the Municipality of Curridabat is seeking a penalty of approximately $380,000 in connection with the construction of a retaining wall seventeen years ago for a perishables distribution center that is situated along a protected river bank. The subsidiary obtained permits from the Municipality and the Secretaria Tcnica Nacional Ambiental at the time of construction, but the Municipality now alleges that the wall is non-conforming. In January 2011, the Environmental Department of Porto Alegre Municipality formally notified Walmart Brazil of soil inspection reports indicating soil contamination due to leakage of oil from power generating equipment at nine store locations in Brazil. Walmart Brazil is cooperating with the agency as well as the District Attorney's Office for the State of Rio Grande do Sul and has filed a mitigation plan to address the situation. ##TABLE_START ", "4": " ITEM 4.

CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES ##TABLE_ENDEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures We maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to provide reasonable assurance that information, which is required to be timely disclosed, is accumulated and communicated to management in a timely fashion. In designing and evaluating such controls and procedures, we recognize that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. Our management is necessarily required to use judgment in evaluating controls and procedures. Also, we have investments in unconsolidated entities. Since we do not control or manage those entities, our controls and procedures with respect to those entities are substantially more limited than those we maintain with respect to our consolidated subsidiaries. In the ordinary course of business, we review our internal control over financial reporting and make changes to our systems and processes to improve such controls and increase efficiency, while ensuring that we maintain an effective internal control environment. Changes may include such activities as implementing new, more efficient systems, updating existing systems, automating manual processes, migrating certain processes to our shared services organizations and increasing monitoring controls. These changes have not materially affected, and are not reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company's internal control over financial reporting. However, they allow us to continue to enhance our internal control over financial reporting and ensure that our internal control environment remains effective. An evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report was performed under the supervision and with the participation of management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer. Based upon that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are effective to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files or submits under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, is accumulated and communicated to management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure and are effective to provide reasonable assurance that such information is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified by the SEC's rules and forms.

BUSINESS ##TABLE_ENDGeneral Walmart Inc. (\"Walmart,\" the \"Company\" or \"we\") helps people around the world save money and live better  anytime and anywhere  in retail stores and through eCommerce. Through innovation, we are striving to create a customer-centric experience that seamlessly integrates our eCommerce and retail stores in an omni-channel offering that saves time for our customers. Each week, we serve nearly 270 million customers who visit our more than 11,700 stores and numerous eCommerce websites under 65 banners in 28 countries. Our strategy is to lead on price, invest to differentiate on access, be competitive on assortment and deliver a great experience. Leading on price is designed to earn the trust of our customers every day by providing a broad assortment of quality merchandise and services at everyday low prices (\"EDLP\"). EDLP is our pricing philosophy under which we price items at a low price every day so our customers trust that our prices will not change under frequent promotional activity. Price leadership is core to who we are. Everyday low cost (\"EDLC\") is our commitment to control expenses so those cost savings can be passed along to our customers. Our omni-channel presence provides customers access to our broad assortment anytime and anywhere. We strive to give our customers and members a great digital and physical shopping experience. Our operations comprise three reportable segments: Walmart U.S., Walmart International and Sam's Club. Our fiscal year ends on January 31 for our United States (\"U.S.\") and Canadian operations. We consolidate all other operations generally using a one-month lag and on a calendar year basis. Our discussion is as of and for the fiscal years ended January 31, 2018 (\"fiscal 2018 \"), January 31, 2017 (\"fiscal 2017 \") and January 31, 2016 (\"fiscal 2016 \"). During fiscal 2018 , we generated total revenues of $500.3 billion , which was primarily comprised of net sales of $495.8 billion . We maintain our principal offices at 702 S.W. 8th Street, Bentonville, Arkansas 72716, USA. Our common stock trades on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol \"WMT.\" The Development of Our Company Although Walmart was incorporated in Delaware in October 1969, the businesses conducted by our founders began in 1945 when Sam M. Walton opened a franchise Ben Franklin variety store in Newport, Arkansas. In 1946, his brother, James L. Walton, opened a similar store in Versailles, Missouri. Until 1962, our founders' business was devoted entirely to the operation of variety stores. In that year, the first Wal-Mart Discount City, which was a discount store, opened in Rogers, Arkansas. In 1983, we opened our first Sam's Club, and in 1988, we opened our first supercenter. In 1998, we opened our first Neighborhood Market. In 1991, we began our first international initiative when we entered into a joint venture in Mexico. Since then, our international presence has expanded and, as of January 31, 2018 , our Walmart International segment conducted business in 27 countries. In 2000, we began our first eCommerce initiative by creating walmart.com. That same year, we also created samsclub.com. Since then, our digital presence has continued to grow. In 2007, walmart.com launched its Site to Store service, enabling customers to make a purchase online and pick up merchandise in stores. In 2016, we acquired jet.com in the U.S. and formed a strategic alliance with JD.com in China. Subsequent to the jet.com purchase, we have acquired several other U.S. eCommerce entities. In 2017, walmart.com launched free two-day shipping on more than 2 million items and we created Store N o 8, a tech incubator with a focus to drive commerce forward. These eCommerce efforts have led to omni-channel offerings in many markets, including over 1,100 \"Online Grocery\" pickup locations in the U.S. Information About Our Segments The Company is engaged in the operation of retail, wholesale and other units, as well as eCommerce websites, located throughout the U.S., Africa, Argentina, Brazil, Canada, Central America, Chile, China, India, Japan, Mexico and the United Kingdom. The Company's operations are conducted in three reportable segments: Walmart U.S., Walmart International and Sam's Club. The Company defines its segments as those operations whose results the chief operating decision maker (\"CODM\") regularly reviews to analyze performance and allocate resources. The Company sells similar individual products and services in each of its segments. It is impractical to segregate and identify revenues for each of these individual products and services. Walmart U.S. is our largest segment and operates retail stores in all 50 states in the U.S., Washington D.C. and Puerto Rico, with three primary store formats, as well as eCommerce. Walmart U.S. generated approximately 64% of our net sales in fiscal 2018 , and of our three segments, Walmart U.S. is the largest and has historically had the highest gross profit as a percentage of net sales (\"gross profit rate\"). In addition, Walmart U.S. has historically contributed the greatest amount to the Company's net sales and operating income. Walmart International consists of operations in 27 countries outside of the U.S. and is divided into three major categories: retail, wholesale and other. These categories consist of many formats, including: supercenters, supermarkets, hypermarkets, warehouse clubs (including Sam's Clubs) and cash  carry, as well as eCommerce. Walmart International generated approximately 24% of our fiscal 2018 net sales. The overall gross profit rate for Walmart International is lower than that of Walmart U.S. primarily because of its merchandise mix. Walmart International is our second largest segment. Sam's Club consists of membership-only warehouse clubs and operates in 44 states in the U.S. and in Puerto Rico, as well as eCommerce. Sam's Club accounted for approximately 12% of our fiscal 2018 net sales. As a membership-only warehouse club, membership income is a significant component of the segment's operating income. Sam's Club operates with a lower gross profit rate and lower operating expenses as a percentage of net sales than our other segments. The Company measures the results of its segments using, among other measures, each segment's net sales and operating income, which includes certain corporate overhead allocations. From time to time, we revise the measurement of each segment's operating income, including any corporate overhead allocations, as determined by the information regularly reviewed by our CODM. When the measurement of a segment changes, previous period amounts and balances are reclassified to be comparable to the current period's presentation. Walmart U.S. Segment The Walmart U.S. segment is a mass merchandiser of consumer products, operating under the \"Walmart,\" \"Wal-Mart\" and \"Walmart Neighborhood Market\" brands, as well as walmart.com and other eCommerce brands. The Walmart U.S. segment had net sales of $318.5 billion , $307.8 billion and $298.4 billion for fiscal 2018 , 2017 and 2016 , respectively. During the most recent fiscal year, no single unit accounted for as much as 1% of total Company consolidated net sales. Physical. Walmart U.S. operates retail stores in the U.S., including in all 50 states, Washington D.C. and Puerto Rico, with supercenters in 49 states, Washington D.C. and Puerto Rico, discount stores in 41 states and Puerto Rico and Neighborhood Markets and other small store formats in 36 states, Washington D.C. and Puerto Rico.

When revisions are made, the previous periods' presentation is adjusted to maintain comparability. Operations. Many supercenters, discount stores and Neighborhood Markets are open 24 hours each day. A variety of payment methods are accepted at our stores and through our eCommerce websites and mobile commerce applications. Seasonal Aspects of Operations. Walmart U.S.'s business is seasonal to a certain extent due to calendar events and national and religious holidays, as well as different weather patterns. Historically, its highest sales volume and segment operating income have occurred in the fiscal quarter ending January 31. Competition. Walmart U.S. competes with both physical retailers operating discount, department, retail and wholesale grocers, drug, dollar, variety and specialty stores, supermarkets, hypermarkets and supercenter-type stores, and digital retailers, as well as catalog businesses. We also compete with others for desirable sites for new or relocated retail units. Our ability to develop, open and operate units at the right locations and to deliver a customer-centric omni-channel experience largely determines our competitive position within the retail industry. We employ many programs designed to meet competitive pressures within our industry. These programs include the following: ##TABLE_START  EDLP: our pricing philosophy under which we price items at a low price every day so our customers trust that our prices will not change under frequent promotional activity; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  EDLC: everyday low cost is our commitment to control expenses so our cost savings can be passed along to our customers; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Rollbacks: our commitment to pass cost savings on to the customer by lowering prices on selected goods; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Savings Catcher, Save Even More and Ad Match: strategies to meet or be below a competitor's advertised price; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Walmart Pickup: customer places order online and picks it up for free from a store.

In addition, our eCommerce capabilities, including omni-channel transactions that involve both an eCommerce platform and a physical format, are important factors in our competition with other retailers. Distribution. For fiscal 2018 , approximately 78% of Walmart U.S.'s purchases of store merchandise were shipped through our 157 distribution facilities, which are located strategically throughout the U.S. The remaining merchandise we purchased was shipped directly from suppliers. General merchandise and dry grocery merchandise is transported primarily through the segment's private truck fleet; however, we contract with common carriers to transport the majority of our perishable grocery merchandise. We ship merchandise purchased by customers on our eCommerce platforms by a number of methods from multiple locations including from our 30 dedicated eCommerce fulfillment centers.

The segment's net sales for fiscal 2018 , 2017 and 2016 , were $118.1 billion , $116.1 billion and $123.4 billion , respectively, which have been impacted by currency exchange rate fluctuations. During the most recent fiscal year, no single unit accounted for as much as 1% of total Company net sales. Physical.

Walmart International operates eCommerce websites in numerous countries. Customers have access through our eCommerce websites and, in countries where available, mobile commerce applications to a broad assortment of merchandise and services, both of which vary by country. Our omni-channel offerings include capabilities like \"Click  Collect\" in the United Kingdom and our grocery pick-up and delivery business in several other markets. Merchandise. The merchandising strategy for Walmart International is similar to that of our operations in the U.S. in terms of the breadth and scope of merchandise offered for sale. While brand name merchandise accounts for a majority of our sales, we have both leveraged U.S. private brands and developed market specific private brands to serve our customers with high quality, lower priced items. Along with the private brands we market globally, such as \"Equate,\" \"George,\" \"Great Value,\" \"Holiday Time,\" \"Mainstays,\" \"Ol' Roy\" and \"Parent's Choice,\" our international markets have developed market specific brands including \"Aurrera,\" \"Cambridge,\" \"Chosen by You\" and \"Extra Special.\" In addition, we have developed relationships with regional and local suppliers in each market to ensure reliable sources of quality merchandise that is equal to national brands at low prices. Operations. The hours of operation for operating units in Walmart International vary by country and by individual markets within countries, depending upon local and national ordinances governing hours of operation. Operating units in each country accept a variety of payment methods. Seasonal Aspects of Operations. Walmart International's business is seasonal to a certain extent. Historically, the segment's highest sales volume and operating income have occurred in the fourth quarter of our fiscal year. The seasonality of the business varies by country due to different national and religious holidays, festivals and customs, as well as different weather patterns. Competition. Walmart International competes with both physical retailers who operate department, drug, discount, variety and specialty stores, supermarkets, hypermarkets and supercenter-type stores, wholesale clubs, home-improvement stores, specialty electronics stores, cash  carry operations and convenience stores, and digital retailers, as well as catalog businesses. We also operate, on a limited basis, consumer credit operations. We compete with others for desirable sites for new or relocated units. Our ability to develop, open and operate units at the right locations and to deliver a customer-centric experience that seamlessly integrates digital and physical shopping determines, to a large extent, our competitive position in the markets in which Walmart International operates. We believe price leadership is a critical part of our business model and we continue to focus on moving our markets towards an EDLP approach. Additionally, our ability to operate food departments effectively has a significant impact on our competitive position in the markets where we operate. In the markets in which we have eCommerce websites or mobile commerce applications, those websites and applications help differentiate us from our competitors and help us compete with other retailers for customers and their purchases, both in our digital and physical retail operations. Distribution. We utilize a total of 188 distribution facilities located in Argentina, Brazil, Canada, Central America, Chile, China, Japan, Mexico, South Africa and the United Kingdom. Through these facilities, we process and distribute both imported and domestic products to the operating units of the Walmart International segment. During fiscal 2018 , approximately 83% of Walmart International's purchases passed through these distribution facilities. Suppliers ship the balance of Walmart International's purchases directly to our stores in the various markets in which we operate. The following table provides further details of our international distribution facilities, including 17 dedicated eCommerce fulfillment centers, as of December 31, 2017, with the exception of distribution facilities in Canada, which are stated as of January 31, 2018 : ##TABLE_START   Owned and Operated  Owned and Third Party Operated  Leased and Operated  Third Party Owned and Operated  Total International distribution facilities      ##TABLE_ENDWe ship merchandise purchased by customers on our eCommerce websites and through our mobile commerce applications by a number of methods from multiple locations including from our dedicated eCommerce fulfillment centers. Sam's Club Segment The Sam's Club segment operates membership-only warehouse clubs, as well as samsclub.com, in the U.S. and had net sales of $59.2 billion , $57.4 billion and $56.8 billion for fiscal 2018 , 2017 and 2016 , respectively. During the most recent fiscal year, no single club location accounted for as much as 1% of total Company net sales. Membership. Beginning in the year ending January 31, 2019 (\"fiscal 2019\"), Sam's Club simplified the membership program. The following two options are available to members: ##TABLE_START  Membership Type  Plus  Club Annual Membership Fee $100  $45 Number of Add-on Memberships ($40 each) Up to 16  Up to 8 Eligible for Cash Rewards Yes  No Eligible for Free Shipping Yes  No ##TABLE_ENDAll memberships include a spouse/household card at no additional cost. Plus Members are eligible for Cash Rewards, which is a benefit that provides $10 for every $500 in qualifying Sam's Club purchases up to a $500 cash reward annually. The amount earned can be used for purchases, membership fees or redeemed for cash. Plus Members are also eligible for Free Shipping on the vast majority of merchandise available online, with no minimum order size. Free Shipping is yet another example of creating a new Sam's Club for our members. Physical. As a membership-only warehouse club, Sam's Club facility sizes generally range between 94,000 and 168,000 square feet, with an average size of approximately 134,000 square feet. The following table provides the retail unit count and retail square feet for the fiscal years shown : ##TABLE_START Fiscal Year  Opened  Closed  Total (1)  Square Feet (1) Balance forward       82,653      84,382   (1 )   86,510      87,552   (4 )   88,376   (67 )   80,068 ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (1) \"Total\" and \"Square Feet\" columns are as of January 31 for the fiscal years shown. Retail square feet are reported in thousands. ##TABLE_END Digital. Sam's Club provides its members access to a broad assortment of merchandise, including products not found in our clubs, and services online at samsclub.com and through our mobile commerce applications. Samsclub.com experiences on average 20.4 million unique visitors a month and offers access to approximately 59,000 SKUs providing the member the option of delivery direct-to-home or to the club through services such as \"Club Pickup.\" Digital retail supports our physical clubs with capabilities like \"Scan and Go,\" a mobile checkout and payment solution, which allows members to bypass the checkout line. Merchandise. Sam's Club offers merchandise in the following five merchandise categories: ##TABLE_START  Grocery and consumables includes dairy, meat, bakery, deli, produce, dry, chilled or frozen packaged foods, alcoholic and nonalcoholic beverages, floral, snack foods, candy, other grocery items, health and beauty aids, paper goods, laundry and home care, baby care, pet supplies and other consumable items; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Fuel and other categories consists of gasoline stations, tobacco, tools and power equipment, and tire and battery centers; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Home and apparel includes home improvement, outdoor living, grills, gardening, furniture, apparel, jewelry, housewares, toys, seasonal items, mattresses and small appliances; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Technology, office and entertainment includes electronics, wireless, software, video games, movies, books, music, office supplies, office furniture, photo processing and third-party gift cards; and ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Health and wellness includes pharmacy, optical and hearing services and over-the-counter drugs. ##TABLE_END The Member's Mark brand continues to expand assortment and deliver member value. In fiscal 2018 , Member's Mark sales exceeded $10 billion, driven by growth in grocery, seasonal items and apparel. The percentage of net sales for Sam's Club, including eCommerce sales, by merchandise category, was as follows for fiscal 2018 , 2017 and 2016 : ##TABLE_START   Fiscal Years Ended January 31, MERCHANDISE CATEGORY    Grocery and consumables  58%  59%  59% Fuel and other categories  21%  20%  20% Home and apparel  9%  9%  9% Technology, office and entertainment  6%  6%  7% Health and wellness  6%  6%  5% Total  100%  100%  100% ##TABLE_ENDOperations. Operating hours for Sam's Clubs are generally Monday through Friday from 10:00 a.m. to 8:30 p.m., Saturday from 9:00 a.m. to 8:30 p.m. and Sunday from 10:00 a.m. to 6:00 p.m. Additionally, all club locations offer Plus Members the ability to shop before the regular operating hours Monday through Saturday, starting at 7:00 a.m. A variety of payment methods are accepted at our clubs and online, including the co-branded Sam's Club \"Cash Back\" MasterCard. Seasonal Aspects of Operations. Sam's Club's business is seasonal to a certain extent due to calendar events and national and religious holidays, as well as different weather patterns. Historically, its highest sales volume and segment operating income have occurred in the fiscal quarter ending January 31. Competition. Sam's Club competes with other membership-only warehouse clubs, the largest of which is Costco, as well as with discount retailers, retail and wholesale grocers, general merchandise wholesalers and distributors, gasoline stations as well as digital retailers and catalog businesses. At Sam's Club, we provide value at members-only prices, a quality merchandise assortment, and bulk sizing to serve both our Plus and Club members. Our eCommerce website and mobile commerce applications have increasingly become important factors in our ability to compete with other membership-only warehouse clubs. Distribution. During fiscal 2018 , approximately 68% of Sam's Club's non-fuel purchases were shipped from Sam's Club's 22 dedicated distribution facilities located strategically throughout the U.S., or from some of the Walmart U.S. segment's distribution facilities, which service the Sam's Club segment for certain items. Suppliers shipped the balance of the Sam's Club segment's purchases directly to Sam's Club locations. The following table provides further details of our dedicated distribution facilities, including two dedicated eCommerce fulfillment centers and two dedicated import facilities, as of January 31, 2018 : ##TABLE_START   Owned and Operated  Owned and Third Party Operated  Leased and Operated  Third Party Owned and Operated  Total Sam's Club distribution facilities      ##TABLE_ENDThe principal focus of Sam's Club's distribution operations is on cross-docking merchandise, while stored inventory is minimized. Cross-docking is a distribution process under which shipments are directly transferred from inbound to outbound trailers. Shipments typically spend less than 24 hours in a cross-dock facility, and sometimes less than an hour. Sam's Club uses a combination of our private truck fleet, as well as common carriers, to transport non-perishable merchandise from distribution facilities to clubs. The segment contracts with common carriers to transport perishable grocery merchandise from distribution facilities to clubs. Sam's Club ships merchandise purchased by members on samsclub.com and through its mobile commerce applications by a number of methods from its dedicated eCommerce fulfillment centers and other distribution centers. Other Segment Information Certain financial information relating to our segments is included in Part II, Item 7 under the caption \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\" and in Note 15 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. Note 15 also includes information regarding total revenues and long-lived assets aggregated by our U.S. and non-U.S. operations. Intellectual Property We regard our trademarks, service marks, copyrights, patents, domain names, trade dress, trade secrets, proprietary technologies, and similar intellectual property as important to our success, and with respect to our associates, customers and others, we rely on trademark, copyright, and patent law, trade-secret protection, and confidentiality and/or license agreements to protect our proprietary rights. We have registered, or applied for the registration of, a number of U.S. and international domain names, trademarks, service marks and copyrights. Additionally, we have filed U.S. and international patent applications covering certain of our proprietary technology. We have licensed in the past, and expect that we may license in the future, certain of our proprietary rights to third parties. Suppliers and Supply Chain As a retailer and warehouse club operator, we utilize a global supply chain that includes over 100,000 suppliers located around the world, including in the United States, from whom we purchase the merchandise that we sell in our stores, clubs and online. In many instances, we purchase merchandise from producers located near the stores and clubs in which such merchandise will be sold, particularly products in the \"fresh\" category. Our purchases may represent a significant percentage of a number of our suppliers' annual sales, and the volume of product we acquire from many suppliers allows us to obtain favorable pricing from such suppliers. Our suppliers are subject to standards of conduct, including requirements that they comply with local labor laws, local worker safety laws and other applicable laws. Our ability to acquire from our suppliers the assortment and volume of products we wish to offer to our customer, to receive those products within the required time through our supply chain and to distribute those products to our stores and clubs determines, in part, our in-stock levels in our stores and clubs and the attractiveness of our merchandise assortment we offer to our customers and members. Employees As of the end of fiscal 2018 , Walmart Inc. and our subsidiaries employed approximately 2.3 million employees (\"associates\") worldwide, with 1.5 million associates in the U.S. and 0.8 million associates internationally. Similar to other retailers, the Company has a large number of part-time, hourly or non-exempt associates. We believe our relationships with our associates are good and are continuing to improve. A large number of associates turn over each year, although Walmart U.S. turnover has been improving in fiscal 2018 as a result of our focus on increasing wages and providing improved tools, technology and training to associates. Certain information relating to retirement-related benefits we provide to our associates is included in Note 12 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. In addition to retirement-related benefits, in the U.S., we offer a broad range of Company-paid benefits to our associates. These include a store discount card or Sam's Club membership, bonuses based on Company performance, matching a portion of purchases of our stock by associates through our Associate Stock Purchase Plan and life insurance. In addition to the health-care benefits for eligible full-time and part-time associates in the U.S., as announced in January 2018, we expanded maternity leave and implemented a new paid parental leave program to all full-time associates. We also introduced a $5,000 benefit to assist eligible associates with adoption. Similarly, in the operations outside the U.S., we provide a variety of associate benefits that vary based on customary local practices and statutory requirements.

RISK FACTORS ##TABLE_ENDThe risks described below could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. Our business operations could also be affected by additional factors that apply to all companies operating in the U.S. and globally. Strategic Risks General or macro-economic factors, both domestically and internationally, may materially adversely affect our financial performance. General economic conditions and other economic factors, globally or in one or more of the markets we serve, may adversely affect our financial performance. Higher interest rates, lower or higher prices of petroleum products, including crude oil, natural gas, gasoline, and diesel fuel, higher costs for electricity and other energy, weakness in the housing market, inflation, deflation, increased costs of essential services, such as medical care and utilities, higher levels of unemployment, decreases in consumer disposable income, unavailability of consumer credit, higher consumer debt levels, changes in consumer spending and shopping patterns, fluctuations in currency exchange rates, higher tax rates, imposition of new taxes or other changes in tax laws, changes in healthcare laws, other regulatory changes, the imposition of measures that create barriers to or increase the costs associated with international trade, overall economic slowdown and other economic factors in the U.S. or in any of the other markets in which we operate could adversely affect consumer demand for the products we sell in the U.S. or such other markets, change the mix of products we sell to one with a lower average gross margin, cause a slowdown in discretionary purchases of goods, adversely affect our net sales and result in slower inventory turnover and greater markdowns of inventory, or otherwise materially adversely affect our operations and operating results. In addition, the economic factors listed above, any other economic factors or circumstances resulting in higher transportation, labor, insurance or healthcare costs or commodity prices, and other economic factors in the U.S. and other countries in which we operate can increase our cost of sales and operating, selling, general and administrative expenses and otherwise materially adversely affect our operations and operating results. The economic factors that affect our operations may also adversely affect the operations of our suppliers, which can result in an increase in the cost to us of the goods we sell to our customers or, in more extreme cases, in certain suppliers not producing goods in the volume typically available to us for sale. We face strong competition from other retailers and wholesale club operators (whether through physical retail, digital retail or the integration of both), which could materially adversely affect our financial performance. Each of our segments competes for customers, employees, store and club sites, digital prominence, products and services and in other important aspects of its business with many other local, regional, national and global physical and digital retailers, wholesale club operators and retail intermediaries. Our Walmart U.S. segment competes with both physical retailers operating discount, department, retail and wholesale grocers, drug, dollar, variety and specialty stores, supermarkets, hypermarkets and supercenter-type stores, and digital retailers, as well as catalog businesses. Our Sam's Club segment competes with other wholesale club operators, as well as discount retailers, retail and wholesale grocers, general merchandise wholesalers and distributors, gasoline stations, as well as digital retailers and catalog businesses. Our Walmart International segment competes with both physical retailers who operate department, drug, discount, variety and specialty stores, supermarkets, hypermarkets and supercenter-type stores, wholesale clubs, home-improvement stores, specialty electronics stores, cash  carry operations and convenience stores, and digital retailers, as well as catalog businesses.  We compete in a variety of ways, including the prices at which we sell our merchandise, merchandise selection and availability, services offered to customers, location, store hours, in-store amenities, the shopping convenience and overall shopping experience we offer, the attractiveness and ease of use of our digital platforms, cost and speed of and options for delivery to customers of merchandise purchased through our digital platforms or through the omni-channel integration of our physical and digital retail operations. A failure to respond effectively to competitive pressures and changes in the retail markets or delays or failure in execution of our strategy could materially adversely affect our financial performance. See \" Item 1. Business \" above for additional discussion of the competitive situation of each of our reportable segments. Certain segments of the retail industry are undergoing consolidation, which could result in increased competition and significantly alter the dynamics of the retail marketplace. Such consolidation, or other business combinations or alliances, may result in competitors with greatly improved financial resources, improved access to merchandise, greater market penetration than they previously enjoyed and other improvements in their competitive positions. Such business combinations or alliances could result in the provision of a wider variety of products and services at competitive prices by such consolidated or aligned companies, which could adversely affect our financial performance. We may not timely identify or effectively respond to consumer trends or preferences, which could negatively affect our relationship with our customers, demand for the products and services we sell, our market share and the growth of our business. It is difficult to predict consistently and successfully the products and services our customers will demand and changes in their shopping patterns. The success of our business depends in part on how accurately we predict consumer demand, availability of merchandise, the related impact on the demand for existing products and the competitive environment, whether for customers purchasing products at our stores and clubs, through our digital platforms or through the combination of both. Price transparency, assortment of products, customer experience, convenience and the speed and cost of shipping are of primary importance to customers and continue to increase in importance, particularly as a result of digital tools and social media available to consumers and the choices available to consumers for purchasing products. Our failure to adequately or effectively respond to changing consumer tastes, preferences and shopping patterns, or any other failure on our part to timely identify or effectively respond to changing consumer tastes, preferences and shopping patterns could negatively affect our relationship with our customers, the demand for the products we sell, our market share and the growth of our business. Failure to grow our eCommerce business through the omni-channel integration of  physical and digital retail or otherwise, and the cost of our increasing eCommerce investments, may materially adversely affect our market position, net sales and financial performance. The retail business is rapidly evolving and consumers are increasingly embracing shopping online and through mobile commerce applications. As a result, the portion of total consumer expenditures with retailers and wholesale clubs occurring through digital platforms is increasing and the pace of this increase could accelerate. Our strategy, which includes investments in eCommerce, technology, store remodels and other customer initiatives may not adequately or effectively allow us to grow our eCommerce business, increase comparable store sales, maintain or grow our overall market position or otherwise offset the impact on the growth of our business of a moderated pace of new store and club openings. The success of this strategy will depend in large measure on our ability to build and deliver a seamless omni-channel shopping experience and is further subject to the risks we face as outlined in this Item 1A . As a result, our market position, net sales and financial performance could be adversely affected. In addition, a greater concentration of eCommerce sales could result in a reduction in the amount of traffic in our stores and clubs, which would, in turn, reduce the opportunities for cross-store or cross-club sales of merchandise that such traffic creates and could reduce our sales within our stores and clubs and materially adversely affect the financial performance of the physical retail side of our operations. Furthermore, the cost of certain eCommerce and technology investments, including any operating losses incurred by acquired eCommerce businesses will adversely impact our financial performance in the short-term and may adversely impact our financial performance over the longer term. The performance of strategic alliances to support the expansion of our Walmart International segment could materially adversely affect our financial performance. Our Walmart International segment may enter into strategic alliances in the countries in which we have existing operations or in other markets to expand our digital retail operations, physical retail operations or both. Any strategic alliance may not generate the level of eCommerce or other sales we anticipate when entering into that alliance or may otherwise adversely impact our business and competitive position relative to the results we could have achieved in the absence of such alliance. In addition, any investment we make in connection with a strategic alliance could materially adversely affect our financial performance. Operational Risks Natural disasters, changes in climate, and geo-political events could materially adversely affect our financial performance. The occurrence of one or more natural disasters, such as hurricanes, tropical storms, floods, fires, earthquakes, tsunamis, cyclones, typhoons, weather conditions such as major or extended winter storms, droughts and tornadoes, whether as a result of climate change or otherwise, severe changes in climate and geo-political events, such as war, civil unrest or terrorist attacks in a country in which we operate or in which our suppliers are located could adversely affect our operations and financial performance. Such events could result in physical damage to, or the complete loss of, one or more of our properties, the closure of one or more stores, clubs and distribution facilities, the lack of an adequate work force in a market, the inability of customers and associates to reach or have transportation to our stores and clubs affected by such events, the evacuation of the populace from areas in which our stores, clubs and distribution facilities are located, the unavailability of our digital platforms to our customers, changes in the purchasing patterns of consumers and in consumers' disposable income, the temporary or long-term disruption in the supply of products from some local and overseas suppliers, the disruption in the transport of goods from overseas, the disruption or delay in the delivery of goods to our distribution facilities or stores within a country in which we are operating, the reduction in the availability of products in our stores, the disruption of utility services to our stores and our facilities, and disruption in our communications with our stores. We bear the risk of losses incurred as a result of physical damage to, or destruction of, any stores, clubs and distribution facilities, loss or spoilage of inventory and business interruption caused by such events. These events and their impacts could otherwise disrupt and adversely affect our operations in the areas in which they occur and could materially adversely affect our financial performance. Risks associated with the suppliers from whom our products are sourced could materially adversely affect our financial performance. The products we sell are sourced from a wide variety of domestic and international suppliers. Global sourcing of many of the products we sell is an important factor in our financial performance. We expect all of our suppliers to comply with applicable laws, including labor, safety and environmental laws, and to otherwise meet our required supplier standards of conduct. Our ability to find qualified suppliers who uphold our standards, and to access products in a timely and efficient manner, is a significant challenge, especially with respect to suppliers located and goods sourced outside the U.S. Political and economic instability in the countries in which our foreign suppliers and their manufacturers are located, the financial instability of suppliers, suppliers' failure to meet certain of our supplier standards (including our responsible sourcing standards), labor problems experienced by our suppliers and their manufacturers, the availability of raw materials to suppliers, merchandise safety and quality issues, disruption in the transportation of merchandise from the suppliers and manufacturers to our stores, clubs, and other facilities, including as a result of labor slowdowns at any port at which a material amount of merchandise we purchase enters into the U.S., currency exchange rates, transport availability and cost, transport security, inflation and other factors relating to the suppliers and the countries in which they are located are beyond our control. In addition, the U.S.'s foreign trade policies, tariffs and other impositions on imported goods, trade sanctions imposed on certain countries, the limitation on the importation of certain types of goods or of goods containing certain materials from other countries and other factors relating to foreign trade are beyond our control. These and other factors affecting our suppliers and our access to products could adversely affect our financial performance. If the products we sell are not safe or otherwise fail to meet our customers' expectations, we could lose customers, incur liability for any injuries suffered by customers using or consuming a product we sell or otherwise experience material adverse effects to our brand, reputation and financial performance. Our customers count on us to provide them with safe products. Concerns regarding the safety of food and non-food products that we source from our suppliers or that we prepare and then sell could cause customers to avoid purchasing certain products from us, or to seek alternative sources of supply for all of their food and non-food needs, even if the basis for the concern is outside of our control. Any lost confidence on the part of our customers would be difficult and costly to reestablish. As such, any issue regarding the safety of any food or non-food items we sell, regardless of the cause, could adversely affect our brand, reputation and financial performance. We rely extensively on information systems to process transactions, summarize results and manage our business. Disruptions in our systems could harm our ability to conduct our operations. Given the number of individual transactions we have each year, it is crucial that we maintain uninterrupted operation of our business-critical information systems. Our information systems are subject to damage or interruption from power outages, computer and telecommunications failures, computer viruses, worms, other malicious computer programs, denial-of-service attacks, security breaches (through cyber-attacks from cyber-attackers and sophisticated organizations), catastrophic events such as fires, tornadoes, earthquakes and hurricanes, and usage errors by our associates or contractors. Our information systems are essential to our business operations, including the processing of transactions, management of our associates, facilities, logistics, inventories, physical stores and clubs and our online operations. Our information systems are not fully redundant and if our systems are damaged, breached or cease to function properly, we may have to make a significant investment to repair or replace them, and we may suffer interruptions in our business operations in the interim. Any interruption to our information systems may have a material adverse effect on our business or results of operations. In addition, we are constantly updating our information technology processes and systems. The risk of system disruption is increased when significant system changes are undertaken. If we fail to timely integrate and update our information systems and processes, we may fail to realize the cost savings anticipated to be derived from these initiatives. If the technology-based systems that give our customers the ability to shop with us online do not function effectively, our operating results, as well as our ability to grow our eCommerce business globally, could be materially adversely affected. Many of our customers shop with us using our digital platforms, which are a part of our omni-channel sales strategy. Increasingly, customers are using computers, tablets, and smart phones to shop online and through digital platforms with us and with our competitors and to do comparison shopping. We use social media and electronic mail to interact with our customers and as a means to enhance their shopping experience. As a part of our omni-channel sales strategy, in addition to home delivery, we offer \"Walmart Pickup,\" \"Pickup Today\" and \"Club Pickup\" and, in a growing number of locations, \"Online Grocery\" programs under which many products available for purchase online can be picked up by the customer at a local Walmart store or Sam's Club, which provides additional customer traffic at such stores and clubs. Omni-channel retailing is a rapidly evolving part of the retail industry and of our operations in the U.S. (whether through organic growth or eCommerce acquisitions) and in a number of markets in which our Walmart International segment operates. We must anticipate and meet our customers' changing expectations while adjusting for technology investments and developments in our competitors' operations through focusing on the building and delivery of a seamless shopping experience across all channels by each operating segment. Any failure on our part to provide attractive, user-friendly secure digital platforms that offer a wide assortment of merchandise at competitive prices and with low cost and rapid delivery options and that continually meet the changing expectations of online shoppers and developments in online and digital platform merchandising and related technology could place us at a competitive disadvantage, result in the loss of eCommerce and other sales, harm our reputation with customers, have a material adverse impact on the growth of our eCommerce business globally and have a material adverse impact on our business and results of operations. Our digital platforms, which are increasingly important to our business and continue to grow in complexity and scope, and the computer and operating systems on which they run, including those applications and systems in our acquired eCommerce businesses, may be subject to cyber-attacks. Those attacks could involve attempts to gain access to one of our eCommerce websites or mobile commerce applications to obtain and make unauthorized use of customers' or members' payment information and related risks discussed below. Such attacks, if successful, can also create denials of service or otherwise disable, degrade or sabotage one or more of our digital platforms and otherwise significantly disrupt our customers' and members' shopping experience. If we are unable to maintain the security of our digital platforms and keep them operating within acceptable parameters, we could suffer loss of sales, reductions in traffic, reputational damage and deterioration of our competitive position and incur liability for any damage to customers whose personal information is unlawfully obtained and used, any of which events could have a material adverse impact on our business and results of operations and impede the execution of our strategy for the growth of our business. Any failure to maintain the security of the information relating to our company, customers, members, associates and vendors, whether as a result of cybersecurity attacks on our information systems or otherwise, could damage our reputation, result in litigation or other legal actions against us, cause us to incur substantial additional costs, and materially adversely affect our business and operating results. As do most retailers, we receive and store in our digital information systems certain personal information about our customers and members, and we receive and store personal information concerning our associates and vendors. Some of that information is stored digitally in connection with our digital platforms. We also utilize third-party service providers for a variety of reasons, including, without limitation, for encryption and authentication technology, content delivery to customers and members, back-office support, and other functions. Such providers may have access to information we hold about our customers, members, associates or vendors. In addition, our eCommerce operations depend upon the secure transmission of confidential information over public networks, including information permitting cashless payments. Cyber threats are rapidly evolving and those threats and the means for obtaining access to information in digital and other storage media are becoming increasingly sophisticated. Cyber threats and cyber-attackers can be sponsored by countries or sophisticated criminal organizations or be the work of single \"hackers\" or small groups of \"hackers.\" Each year, cyber-attackers make numerous attempts to access the information stored in our information systems. As cyber threats evolve, change and become more difficult to detect and successfully defend against, one or more cyber-attacks might defeat our or a third-party service provider's security measures in the future and obtain the personal information of customers, members, associates and vendors. Associate error or malfeasance, faulty password management or other irregularities may also result in a defeat of our or our third-party service providers' security measures and a breach of our or their information systems. Moreover, hardware, software or applications we use may have inherent defects of design, manufacture or operations or could be inadvertently or intentionally implemented or used in a manner that could compromise information security. We or our third-party service providers may not discover any security breach and loss of information for a significant period of time after the security breach occurs. Any breach of our security measures or any breach, error or malfeasance of those of our third-party service providers and loss of our confidential information, or any failure by us to comply with applicable privacy and information security laws and regulations, could cause us to incur significant costs to protect any customers, members, associates and vendors whose personal data was compromised and to restore their confidence in us and to make changes to our information systems and administrative processes to address security issues and compliance with applicable laws and regulations. In addition, such events could be widely publicized and could materially adversely affect our reputation with our customers, members, associates, vendors and shareholders, could harm our competitive position particularly with respect to our eCommerce operations, and could result in a material reduction in our net sales in our eCommerce operations, as well as in our stores thereby materially adversely affecting our operations, net sales, results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and liquidity. Such events could also result in the release to the public of confidential information about our operations and financial condition and performance and could result in litigation or other legal actions against us or the imposition of penalties, fines, fees or liabilities, which may not be covered by our insurance policies. Moreover, a security breach could require us to devote significant management resources to address the problems created by the security breach and to expend significant additional resources to upgrade further the security measures we employ to guard personal information against cyber-attacks and other attempts to access such information and could result in a disruption of our operations, particularly our digital retail operations. We accept payments using a variety of methods, including cash, checks, credit and debit cards, our private label credit cards and gift cards, and we may offer new payment options over time, which may have information security risk implications. As a retailer accepting debit and credit cards for payment, we are subject to various industry data protection standards and protocols, such as payment network security operating guidelines and the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard. We cannot be certain that the security measures we maintain to protect all of our information technology systems are able to prevent, contain or detect any cyber-attacks, cyber terrorism, or security breaches from known cyber-attacks or malware that may be developed in the future. To the extent that any cyber-attack or incursion in our or one of our third-party service provider's information systems results in the loss, damage or misappropriation of information, we may be materially adversely affected by claims from customers, financial institutions, regulatory authorities, payment card networks and others. In certain circumstances, payment card association rules and obligations to which we are subject under our contracts with payment card processors make us liable to payment card issuers if information in connection with payment cards and payment card transactions that we hold is compromised, which liabilities could be substantial. In addition, the cost of complying with stricter and more complex data privacy, data collection and information security laws and standards could be significant to us. Changes in the results of our retail pharmacy business could adversely affect our overall results of operations, cash flows and liquidity. Walmart has retail pharmacy operations in our Walmart U.S. and Sam's Club segments and a large majority of the retail pharmacy net sales are generated by filling prescriptions for which we receive payment through established contractual relationships with third-party payers and payment administrators, such as private insurers, governmental agencies and pharmacy benefit managers (\"PBMs\"). Our retail pharmacy operations are subject to numerous risks, including: reductions in the third-party reimbursement rates for drugs; changes in our payer mix (i.e., shifts in the relative distribution of our pharmacy customers across drug insurance plans and programs toward plans and programs with less favorable reimbursement terms); changes in third party payer drug formularies (i.e., the schedule of prescription drugs approved for reimbursement or which otherwise receive preferential coverage treatment); growth in, and our participation in or exclusion from, exclusive and preferred pharmacy network arrangements operated by PBMs and/or any insurance plan or program; increases in the prices we pay for brand name and generic prescription drugs we sell; increases in the administrative burdens associated with seeking third-party reimbursement; changes in the frequency with which new brand name pharmaceuticals become available to consumers; introduction of lower cost generic drugs as substitutes for existing brand name drugs for which there was no prior generic drug competition; changes in drug mix (i.e., the relative distribution of drugs customers purchase at our pharmacies between brands and generics); changes in the health insurance market generally; changes in the scope of or the elimination of Medicare Part D or Medicaid drug programs; increased competition from other retail pharmacy operations; further consolidation among third party payers, PBMs or purchasers of drugs; overall economic conditions and the ability of our pharmacy customers to pay for drugs prescribed for them to the extent the costs are not reimbursed by a third party; failure to meet any performance or incentive thresholds to which our level of third party reimbursement may be subject; and changes in the regulatory environment for the retail pharmacy industry and the pharmaceutical industry, including as a result of restrictions on the further implementation of or the repeal of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act or the enactment and implementation of a law replacing such act, and other changes in laws, rules and regulations that affect our retail pharmacy business. If the supply of certain pharmaceuticals provided by one or more of our vendors were to be disrupted for any reason, our pharmacy operations could be severely affected until at least such time as we could obtain a new supplier for such pharmaceuticals. Any such disruption could cause reputational damage and result in a significant number of our pharmacy customers transferring their prescriptions to other pharmacies. One or a combination of such factors may adversely affect the volumes of brand name and generic pharmaceuticals we sell, our cost of sales associated with our retail pharmacy operations, and the net sales and gross margin of those operations, result in the loss of cross-store or cross-club selling opportunities and, in turn, adversely affect our overall net sales, other results of operations, cash flows and liquidity. Our failure to attract and retain qualified associates, increases in wage and benefit costs, changes in laws and other labor issues could materially adversely affect our financial performance. Our ability to continue to conduct and expand our operations depends on our ability to attract and retain a large and growing number of qualified associates globally. Our ability to meet our labor needs, including our ability to find qualified personnel to fill positions that become vacant at our existing stores, clubs and distribution centers, while controlling our associate wage and related labor costs, is generally subject to numerous external factors, including the availability of a sufficient number of qualified persons in the work force of the markets in which we operate, unemployment levels within those markets, prevailing wage rates, changing demographics, health and other insurance costs and adoption of new or revised employment and labor laws and regulations. If we are unable to locate, to attract or to retain qualified personnel, the quality of service we provide to our customers may decrease and our financial performance may be adversely affected. In addition, if our costs of labor or related costs increase for other reasons or if new or revised labor laws, rules or regulations or healthcare laws are adopted or implemented that further increase our labor costs, our financial performance could be materially adversely affected. Financial Risks Fluctuations in foreign exchange rates may materially adversely affect our financial performance and our reported results of operations. Our operations in countries other than the U.S. are conducted primarily in the local currencies of those countries. Our consolidated financial statements are denominated in U.S. dollars, and to prepare those financial statements we must translate the amounts of the assets, liabilities, net sales, other revenues and expenses of our operations outside of the U.S. from local currencies into U.S. dollars using exchange rates for the current period. In recent years, fluctuations in currency exchange rates that were unfavorable to us coupled with such translations have had a material adverse effect on our reported results of operations. As a result of such translations, fluctuations in currency exchange rates from period-to-period that are unfavorable to us may also result in our consolidated financial statements reflecting significant adverse period-over-period changes in our financial performance or reflecting a period-over-period improvement in our financial performance that is not as robust as it would be without such fluctuations in the currency exchange rates. Such unfavorable currency exchange rate fluctuations will adversely affect the reported performance of our Walmart International operating segment and have a corresponding adverse effect on our reported consolidated results of operations. We may pay for products we purchase for sale in our stores and clubs around the world with a currency other than the local currency of the country in which the goods will be sold. When we must acquire the currency to pay for such products and the exchange rates for the payment currency fluctuate in a manner unfavorable to us, our cost of sales may increase and we may be unable or unwilling to change the prices at which we sell those goods to address that increase in our costs, with a corresponding adverse effect on our gross profit. Consequently, fluctuations in currency exchange rates may adversely affect our results of operations. Failure to meet market expectations for our financial performance could adversely affect the market price and volatility of our stock. We believe that the price of our stock generally reflects high market expectations for our future operating results. Any failure to meet or delay in meeting these expectations, including our comparable store and club sales growth rates, eCommerce growth rates, gross margin, or earnings and earnings per share could cause the market price of our stock to decline, as could changes in our dividend or stock repurchase programs or policies. Additionally, failure of Walmart's performance to match that of other retailers may have a negative effect on the price of our stock. Legal, Tax, Regulatory, Compliance, Reputational and Other Risks Our operations subject us to legislative, judicial, accounting, legal, regulatory, tax, political and economic risks and conditions specific to the countries or regions in which we operate, which could materially adversely affect our business or financial performance. In addition to our U.S. operations, we operate our retail business principally through wholly-owned subsidiaries in Argentina, Brazil, Canada, Chile, China, India, Japan and the United Kingdom and our majority-owned subsidiaries in Africa, Central America and Mexico. In fiscal 2018, our Walmart U.S. and Sam's Club operating segments generated approximately 76% of our consolidated net sales. The Federal Government has created the potential for significant changes in trade policies, including tariffs and government regulations affecting trade between the U.S. and other countries where we source many of the products we sell in our stores and clubs. Potential changes which have been discussed include the renegotiation or termination of trade agreements and the imposition of higher tariffs on imports into the U.S. A significant portion of the general merchandise we sell in our U.S. stores and clubs is manufactured in other countries. Any such actions could increase the cost to us of such merchandise (whether imported directly or indirectly) and cause increases in the prices at which we sell such merchandise to our customers, which could materially adversely affect the financial performance of our U.S. operations and our business. During fiscal 2018, our Walmart International operations generated approximately 24% of our consolidated net sales. Walmart International's operations in various countries also sources goods and services from other countries. Our future operating results in these countries could be negatively affected by a variety of factors, most of which are beyond our control. These factors include political conditions, including political instability, local and global economic conditions, legal and regulatory constraints, local product safety and environmental laws, tax regulations, local labor laws, anti-money laundering laws and regulations, trade policies, currency regulations, and other matters in any of the countries or regions in which we operate, now or in the future. Our business and results of operations in the UK may be negatively affected by fluctuations in currency exchange rates, increases in food costs, changes in trade policies, or changes in labor, immigration, tax or other laws resulting from the UK's anticipated exit from the European Union. Brazilian federal, state and local laws are complex and subject to varying interpretations. Although the Company believes it complies with those laws, the Company's subsidiaries in Brazil are party to a large number of labor claims and non-income tax assessments, which have arisen during the normal course of business in Brazil. These matters are subject to inherent uncertainties and if decided adversely to the Company, could materially adversely affect our financial performance. The economies of some of the countries in which we have operations have in the past suffered from high rates of inflation and currency devaluations, which, if they occurred again, could adversely affect our financial performance. Other factors which may impact our international operations include foreign trade, monetary and fiscal policies of the U.S. and of other countries, laws, regulations and other activities of foreign governments, agencies and similar organizations, and risks associated with having numerous facilities located in countries which have historically been less stable than the U.S. Additional risks inherent in our international operations generally include, among others, the costs and difficulties of managing international operations, adverse tax consequences and greater difficulty in enforcing intellectual property rights in countries other than the U.S. The various risks inherent in doing business in the U.S. generally also exist when doing business outside of the U.S., and may be exaggerated by the difficulty of doing business in numerous sovereign jurisdictions due to differences in culture, laws and regulations. In foreign countries in which we have operations, a risk exists that our associates, contractors or agents could, in contravention of our policies, engage in business practices prohibited by U.S. laws and regulations applicable to us, such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (\"FCPA\"), or the laws and regulations of other countries, such as the UK Bribery Act. We maintain a global policy prohibiting such business practices and have in place a global anti-corruption compliance program designed to ensure compliance with these laws and regulations. Nevertheless, we remain subject to the risk that one or more of our associates, contractors or agents, including those based in or from countries where practices that violate such U.S. laws and regulations or the laws and regulations of other countries may be customary, will engage in business practices that are prohibited by our policies, circumvent our compliance programs and, by doing so, violate such laws and regulations. Any such violations, even if prohibited by our internal policies, could adversely affect our business or financial performance and our reputation. We are subject to income taxes and other taxes in both the U.S. and the foreign jurisdictions in which we currently operate or have historically operated. The determination of our worldwide provision for income taxes and current and deferred tax assets and liabilities requires judgment and estimation. Our income taxes could be materially adversely affected by earnings being lower than anticipated in jurisdictions that have lower statutory tax rates and higher than anticipated in jurisdictions that have higher statutory tax rates, by changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities, or by changes in worldwide tax laws, regulations, or accounting principles. On December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the \"Tax Act\") was enacted and contains significant changes to U.S. income tax law. Effective in 2018, the Tax Act reduces the U.S. statutory tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent and creates new taxes focused on foreign-sourced earnings and related-party payments. In addition, the Company was subject to a one-time transition tax in fiscal 2018 on accumulated foreign subsidiary earnings not previously subject to U.S. income tax. The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) staff issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118 (\"SAB 118\") on December 22, 2017, which allows companies to record provisional amounts during a measurement period not to extend beyond one year of the enactment date. Due to the timing of the enactment and the complexity involved in applying the provisions of the Tax Act, the Company made reasonable estimates of the effects and recorded provisional amounts in our financial statements as of January 31, 2018, in accordance with SAB 118. As the Company collects and prepares necessary data, and interprets the Tax Act and any additional guidance issued by the U.S. Treasury Department, the IRS, and other standard-setting bodies, the Company may make adjustments to the provisional amounts during fiscal 2019. Those adjustments may materially impact our provision for income taxes and effective tax rate in the period in which the adjustments are made and could impact our net income and our earnings per share, as well as our consolidated cash flows and liquidity. We are subject to regular review and audit by both domestic and foreign tax authorities as well as subject to the prospective and retrospective effects of changing tax regulations and legislation. Although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, the ultimate tax outcome may materially differ from the tax amounts recorded in our consolidated financial statements and may materially affect our income tax provision, net income, or cash flows in the period or periods for which such determination and settlement is made. We operate in complex regulated environments in the United States and in the other countries in which we operate and could be adversely affected by changes to existing legal requirements including the related interpretations and enforcement practices, new legal requirements and/or any failure to comply with applicable regulations. Our pharmacy operations in the United States are subject to numerous federal, state and local regulations including licensing and other requirements for pharmacies and reimbursement arrangements. The regulations to which we are subject include, but are not limited to: federal and state registration and regulation of pharmacies; dispensing and sale of controlled substances and products containing pseudoephedrine; applicable governmental payer regulations including Medicare and Medicaid; data privacy and security laws and regulations including the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, the Affordable Care Act or any successor thereto; laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment and health and safety matters, including those governing exposure to, and the management and disposal of, hazardous substances; regulations regarding food and drug safety including those of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (the \"FDA\") and the Drug Enforcement Administration (the \"DEA\"), trade regulations including those of the U.S. Federal Trade Commission, and consumer protection and safety regulations including those of the Consumer Product Safety Commission, as well as state regulatory authorities, governing the availability, sale, advertisement and promotion of products we sell and the financial services we offer; anti-kickback laws; false claims laws; and federal and state laws governing health care fraud and abuse and the practice of the professions of pharmacy, optical care and nurse practitioner services. For example, in the United States the DEA and various other regulatory authorities regulate the distribution and dispensing of pharmaceuticals and controlled substances. We are required to hold valid DEA and state-level licenses, meet various security and operating standards and comply with the federal and various state controlled substance acts and related regulations governing the sale, dispensing, disposal, holding and distribution of controlled substances. The DEA, FDA and state regulatory authorities have broad enforcement powers, including the ability to seize or recall products and impose significant criminal, civil and administrative sanctions for violations of these laws and regulations. We are also governed by foreign, national and state laws of general applicability, including laws regulating matters of working conditions, health and safety and equal employment opportunity and other labor and employment matters, as well as employee benefit, competition, anti-money laundering, antitrust matters and health and wellness related regulations for our pharmacy operations outside of the United States. Changes in laws, regulations and policies and the related interpretations and enforcement practices may alter the landscape in which we do business and may significantly affect our cost of doing business. The impact of new laws, regulations and policies and the related interpretations and enforcement practices generally cannot be predicted, and changes in applicable laws, regulations and policies and the related interpretations and enforcement practices may require extensive system and operational changes, be difficult to implement, increase our operating costs and require significant capital expenditures. Untimely compliance or noncompliance with applicable laws and regulations could result in the imposition of civil and criminal penalties that could adversely affect the continued operation of our businesses, including: suspension of payments from government programs; loss of required government certifications; loss of authorizations to participate in or exclusion from government programs, including the Medicare and Medicaid programs in the United States; loss of licenses; and significant fines or monetary damages and/or penalties. Any failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements in the United States or in any of the countries in which we operate could result in significant legal and financial exposure, damage our reputation, and have a material adverse effect on our business operations, financial condition and results of operations. We are subject to certain legal proceedings that may materially adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. We are involved in a number of legal proceedings, which include consumer, employment, tort and other litigation. In particular, we are currently a defendant in a number of cases containing class-action allegations in which the plaintiffs have brought claims under federal and state wage and hour laws, as well as a number of cases containing class-action allegations in which the plaintiffs have brought claims under federal and state consumer laws. In addition, ASDA Stores, Ltd. (\"ASDA\"), a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, has been named as a defendant in over 10,000 \"equal value\" claims pending in the Manchester Employment Tribunal (the \"Employment Tribunal\") in the United Kingdom. The claimants, who are current and former ASDA store employees, allege that the work performed by female employees in ASDA's retail stores is of equal value in terms of, among other things, the demands of their jobs to that of male employees working in ASDA's warehouses and distribution facilities, and that the disparity in pay between these different job positions is not objectively justified. The claimants are seeking differential back pay based on higher wage rates in the warehouses and distribution facilities and higher wage rates on a prospective basis. At present, we cannot predict the number of such claims that may be filed, and cannot reasonably estimate any loss or range of loss that may arise from these proceedings. In December 2017, the United States Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation consolidated numerous lawsuits filed against a wide array of defendants by various plaintiffs, including counties, cities, healthcare providers, Native American tribes, individuals, and third-party payors, asserting claims generally concerning the impacts of widespread opioid abuse. The consolidated multidistrict litigation is entitled In re National Prescription Opiate Litigation  (MDL No. 2804) , and is pending in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Ohio. The Company is named as a defendant in some of the cases included in this multidistrict litigation, including cases filed by several counties in West Virginia; by healthcare providers in Mississippi, Alabama, Texas, and Florida; and by the St. Croix Chippewa Indians of Wisconsin. Similar cases that name the Company have been filed in state courts by various counties and municipalities; by health care providers; and by various Native American Tribes. At present, we cannot predict the number of such claims that may be filed, and cannot reasonably estimate any loss or range of loss that may arise from such claims. We discuss these cases and other litigation to which we are party below under the caption \" Item 3. Legal Proceedings \" and in Note 10 in the \" Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements ,\" which are part of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. We could be subject to liability, penalties and other sanctions and other adverse consequences arising out of our on-going FCPA matter. The Audit Committee of our Board of Directors has been conducting an internal investigation into, among other things, alleged violations of the FCPA and other alleged crimes or misconduct in connection with certain of our foreign subsidiaries, including Wal-Mart de Mxico, S.A.B. de C.V. (\"Walmex\"), and whether prior allegations of such violations and/or misconduct were appropriately handled by the Company. We have also been conducting a voluntary global review of our policies, practices and internal controls for anti-corruption compliance and are engaged in strengthening our global anti-corruption compliance programs. Since the implementation of the global review and enhanced anti-corruption compliance programs, the Audit Committee and we have identified or been made aware of additional allegations regarding potential violations of the FCPA. Inquiries or investigations regarding allegations of potential FCPA violations have been commenced in a number of foreign markets in which we operate, including, but not limited to, Brazil, China and India. In November 2011, we voluntarily disclosed our investigative activity to the U.S. Department of Justice (the \"DOJ\") and the SEC. We have been cooperating with those agencies and discussions have been ongoing with them regarding the resolution of these matters. These discussions have progressed to a point that we can now reasonably estimate a probable loss and have recorded an aggregate accrual of $283 million with respect to these matters (the \"Accrual\"). A number of federal and local government agencies in Mexico have also initiated investigations of these matters. Furthermore, lawsuits relating to the matters under investigation have been filed by several of our shareholders against us, certain of our current and former directors and officers and certain of Walmex's current and former officers. We could be exposed to a variety of negative consequences as a result of these matters. One or more enforcement actions could be instituted in respect of the matters that are the subject of some or all of the on-going government investigations, and such actions, if brought, may result in judgments, settlements, fines, penalties, injunctions, cease and desist orders, debarment or other relief, criminal convictions and/or penalties. The shareholder lawsuits may result in judgments against us and our current and former directors and officers named in those proceedings. We also expect that there will be ongoing media and governmental interest regarding these matters, including additional news articles on these matters that could impact the perception of our role as a corporate citizen among certain audiences. Moreover, we have incurred and expect to continue to incur costs in responding to requests for information or subpoenas seeking documents, testimony and other information in connection with the government investigations, in defending the shareholder lawsuits and in conducting our review and investigations. While we have made an Accrual for these matters, because the discussions are continuing, there can be no assurance as to the timing or the terms of the final resolution of these matters. Although we do not presently believe that these matters will have a material adverse effect on our business, given the inherent uncertainties in such situations, we can provide no assurance that these matters will not be material to our business in the future. ##TABLE_START ", "1B": " ITEM 1B.

CERTAIN OTHER PROCEEDINGS: The Company is a defendant in several lawsuits in which the complaints closely track the allegations set forth in a news story that appeared in The New York Times ( the \" Times \" ) on April 21, 2012. One of these is a securities lawsuit that was filed on May 7, 2012, in the United States District Court for the Middle District of Tennessee, and subsequently transferred to the Western District of Arkansas, in which the plaintiff alleges various violations of the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (the \"FCPA\") beginning in 2005, and asserts violations of Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, relating to certain prior disclosures of the Company. The plaintiff seeks to represent a class of shareholders who purchased or acquired stock of the Company between December 8, 2011, and April 20, 2012, and seeks damages and other relief based on allegations that the defendants' conduct affected the value of such stock. On September 20, 2016, the court granted plaintiff's motion for class certification. On October 6, 2016, the defendants filed a petition to appeal the class certification ruling to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit. On November 7, 2016, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit denied the Company's petition. In addition, a number of derivative complaints have been filed in Delaware and Arkansas, also tracking the allegations of the Times story, and naming various current and former directors and certain former officers as additional defendants. The plaintiffs in the derivative suits (in which the Company is a nominal defendant) allege, among other things, that the defendants who are or were directors or officers of the Company breached their fiduciary duties in connection with their oversight of FCPA compliance. All of the derivative suits have been combined into two consolidated proceedings, one of which was consolidated in the United States District Court for the Western District of Arkansas and the other in the Delaware Court of Chancery. On March 31, 2015, the Western District of Arkansas granted the defendants' motion to dismiss the consolidated derivative proceedings in that court. On April 15, 2015, plaintiffs filed their notice of appeal with the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit. On July 22, 2016, the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit affirmed the dismissal of the consolidated derivative proceedings in Arkansas. There was no appeal from that ruling. On May 13, 2016, the Delaware Court of Chancery granted the defendants' motion to dismiss the consolidated derivative proceedings in that court. On June 10, 2016, plaintiffs in the Delaware consolidated derivative proceedings filed their notice of appeal to the Delaware Supreme Court. On January 25, 2018, the Delaware Supreme Court affirmed the dismissal of the consolidated derivative proceedings in Delaware. Management does not believe any possible loss or the range of any possible loss that may be incurred in connection with these proceedings will be material to the Company's financial condition or results of operations.

Delaware Derivative Litigation, Delaware Ct. of Chancery, 4/25/12; Delaware Supreme Court, Dover, DE; 6/10/16. III. ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS: Item 103 of SEC Regulation S-K requires disclosure of certain environmental matters. The following matters are disclosed in accordance with that requirement. For the matters listed below, management does not believe any possible loss or the range of any possible loss that may be incurred in connection with each matter, individually or in the aggregate, will be material to the Company's financial condition or results of operations. On January 25, 2018, the Environmental Prosecutor of the State of Chiapas (Procuradura Ambiental del Estado de Chiapas) in Mexico imposed a fine of $163,000 for the absence of an Environmental Impact Authorization License related to the store Mi Bodega Las Rosas. The Company plans to challenge the fine before an administrative court. In May 2017, WMS Supermercados do Brasil Ltda (\"Walmart Brazil\") self-reported to the relevant municipal environmental agency, and proposed a remediation plan for, an oil contamination in the soil and underground water at the Walmart and Sam's Club store location in Barueri, So Paulo (Tambor), which contamination had been confirmed by an internal investigation in April 2017. Walmart Brazil is cooperating with the agency, including seeking authorization to start a remediation plan. In April 2017, the California Air Resources Board (\"ARB\") notified the Company that it had taken the position that retailers are required to use unclaimed deposits collected on sales of small containers of automotive refrigerant to fund certain consumer education programs. The ARB alleged that the Company had improperly retained approximately $4.2 million in unclaimed deposits and has sought reimbursement. The Company has denied any wrongdoing. In November and December 2016, the Environmental and Natural History Ministry of Chiapas, Mexico (\"Ministry\") notified a subsidiary of the Company, Arrendadora de Centros Comerciales, S. de R.L. de C.V. (\"Arrendadora\"), that it was proposing aggregated penalties approximating $430,000 in respect to four stores which the Ministry believed may have been constructed without first obtaining a required environmental impact license. Arrendadora has challenged the penalties before an administrative court and the trials are in process. The Ministry had previously proposed penalties of approximately $640,000 related to this matter in 2014, but Arrendadora was released by an administrative court from payment of such penalties on the basis that the Ministry had failed to comply with legal formalities in connection with their imposition. On April 6, 2015, representatives for the Brazilian Institute of the Environment alleged that Walmart Brazil had failed to file required reports documenting the number of tires imported, sold and recycled. The agency proposed a penalty of approximately $857,000, which may be doubled and excludes additional amounts in respect of inflation and interest, and prohibited Walmart Brazil from selling or importing tires until the matter is resolved. In October 2015, Walmart Brazil filed its defense with the agency against the imposition of this penalty. In April 2013, a subsidiary of the Company, Corporacion de Compaias Agroindustriales, operating in Costa Rica, became aware that the Municipality of Curridabat is seeking a penalty of approximately $380,000 in connection with the construction of a retaining wall seventeen years ago for a perishables distribution center that is situated along a protected river bank. The subsidiary obtained permits from the Municipality and the Secretaria Tcnica Nacional Ambiental at the time of construction, but the Municipality now alleges that the wall is non-conforming. In January 2011, the Environmental Department of Porto Alegre Municipality formally notified Walmart Brazil of soil inspection reports indicating soil contamination due to leakage of oil from power generating equipment at nine store locations in Brazil. Walmart Brazil is cooperating with the agency as well as the District Attorney's Office for the State of Rio Grande do Sul and has filed a mitigation plan to address the situation. ##TABLE_START ", "4": " ITEM 4.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS ##TABLE_ENDOverview Walmart Inc. (\"Walmart,\" the \"Company\" or \"we\") is engaged in retail and wholesale operations in various formats around the world. Through our operations, we help people around the world save money and live better  anytime and anywhere  in retail stores and through eCommerce. Through innovation, we are striving to create a customer-centric experience that seamlessly integrates digital and physical shopping into an omni-channel offering that saves time for our customers. Physical retail encompasses our brick and mortar presence in each of the markets in which we operate. Digital retail, or eCommerce, is comprised of our eCommerce websites, mobile commerce applications and transactions involving both an eCommerce platform and a physical format, which we refer to as omni-channel. Each week, we serve nearly 270 million customers who visit our more than 11,700 stores and numerous eCommerce websites under 65 banners in 28 countries. Our strategy is to lead on price, invest to differentiate on access, be competitive on assortment and deliver a great experience. By leading on price we earn the trust of our customers every day by providing a broad assortment of quality merchandise and services at everyday low prices (\"EDLP\"). EDLP is our pricing philosophy under which we price items at a low price every day so our customers trust that our prices will not change under frequent promotional activity. Price leadership is core to who we are. Everyday low cost (\"EDLC\") is our commitment to control expenses so our cost savings can be passed along to our customers. Our physical and digital presence, in which we are investing to integrate into a seamless omni-channel, provides customers convenient access to our broad assortment anytime and anywhere. We strive to give our customers and members a great shopping experience through whichever shopping method they prefer. Our operations consist of three reportable segments: Walmart U.S., Walmart International and Sam's Club. ##TABLE_START  Walmart U.S. is our largest segment with three primary store formats and eCommerce, as well as an omni-channel offering. Of our three reportable segments, Walmart U.S. has historically had the highest gross profit as a percentage of net sales (\"gross profit rate\"). In addition, it has historically contributed the greatest amount to the Company's net sales and operating income. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Walmart International consists of our operations outside of the U.S. and includes retail, wholesale and other businesses. These categories, including eCommerce, consist of many formats, including: supercenters, supermarkets, hypermarkets, warehouse clubs (including Sam's Clubs) and cash  carry. Overall gross profit rate for Walmart International is lower than that of Walmart U.S. primarily because of its merchandise mix. Walmart International is our second largest segment and has grown in recent years by adding retail, wholesale and other units, and expanding eCommerce. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Sam's Club consists of membership-only warehouse clubs as well as eCommerce through samsclub.com. As a membership-only warehouse club, membership income is a significant component of the segment's operating income. Sam's Club operates with a lower gross profit rate and lower operating expenses as a percentage of net sales than our other segments. ##TABLE_END Each of our segments contributes to the Company's operating results differently. Each, however, has generally maintained a consistent contribution rate to the Company's net sales and operating income in recent years other than minor changes to the contribution rate for the Walmart International segment due to fluctuations in currency exchange rates. Our fiscal year ends on January 31 for our U.S. and Canadian operations. We consolidate all other operations generally using a one-month lag and on a calendar year basis. Our business is seasonal to a certain extent due to calendar events and national and religious holidays, as well as weather patterns. Generally, our highest sales volume and operating income have occurred in the fiscal quarter ending January 31 . This discussion, which presents our results for the fiscal years ended January 31, 2018 (\"fiscal 2018 \"), January 31, 2017 (\"fiscal 2017 \") and January 31, 2016 (\"fiscal 2016 \") should be read in conjunction with our Consolidated Financial Statements and the accompanying notes. We intend for this discussion to provide the reader with information that will assist in understanding our financial statements, the changes in certain key items in those financial statements from period to period and the primary factors that accounted for those changes. We also discuss certain performance metrics that management uses to assess the Company's performance. Additionally, the discussion provides information about the financial results of the three segments of our business to provide a better understanding of how each of those segments and its results of operations affect the financial condition and results of operations of the Company as a whole. Throughout this Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, we discuss segment operating income, comparable store and club sales and other measures. Management measures the results of the Company's segments using each segment's operating income, including certain corporate overhead allocations, as well as other measures. From time to time, we revise the measurement of each segment's operating income, including certain corporate overhead allocations, and other measures as determined by the information regularly reviewed by our chief operating decision maker. When we do so, the previous period amounts and balances are reclassified to conform to the current period's presentation. Comparable store and club sales, or comparable sales, is a metric that indicates the performance of our existing stores and clubs by measuring the change in sales for such stores and clubs, including eCommerce sales, for a particular period from the corresponding period in the previous year. Walmart's definition of comparable sales includes sales from stores and clubs open for the previous 12 months, including remodels, relocations, expansions and conversions, as well as eCommerce sales. We measure the eCommerce sales impact by including all sales initiated online or though mobile applications, including omni-channel transactions which are fulfilled through our stores and clubs. Sales of a store that has changed in format are excluded from comparable sales when the conversion of that store is accompanied by a relocation or expansion that results in a change in the store's retail square feet of more than five percent. Additionally, sales related to eCommerce acquisitions are excluded until such acquisitions have been owned for 12 months. Comparable sales are also referred to as \"same-store\" sales by others within the retail industry. The method of calculating comparable sales varies across the retail industry. As a result, our calculation of comparable sales is not necessarily comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. In discussing our operating results, we use the term \"currency exchange rates\" to refer to the currency exchange rates we use to convert the operating results for all countries where the functional currency is not the U.S. dollar into U.S. dollars for financial reporting purposes. We calculate the effect of changes in currency exchange rates from the prior period to the current period as the difference between current period activity translated using the current period's currency exchange rates, and current period activity translated using the comparable prior year period's currency exchange rates. Throughout our discussion, we refer to the results of this calculation as the impact of currency exchange rate fluctuations. Volatility in currency exchange rates may impact the results, including net sales and operating income, of the Company and the Walmart International segment in the future. The Retail Industry We operate in the highly competitive retail industry in all of the markets we serve. We face strong sales competition from other discount, department, drug, dollar, variety and specialty stores, warehouse clubs and supermarkets, as well as eCommerce businesses. Many of these competitors are national, regional or international chains or have a national or international online presence. We compete with a number of companies for prime retail site locations, as well as in attracting and retaining quality employees (\"associates\"). We, along with other retail companies, are influenced by a number of factors including, but not limited to: catastrophic events, weather, competitive pressures, consumer disposable income, consumer debt levels and buying patterns, consumer credit availability, cost of goods, currency exchange rate fluctuations, customer preferences, deflation, inflation, fuel and energy prices, general economic conditions, insurance costs, interest rates, labor costs, tax rates, cybersecurity attacks and unemployment. Further information on the factors that can affect our operating results and on certain risks to our Company and an investment in its securities can be found herein under \" Item 1A. Risk Factors ,\" and under \" Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements .\" Company Performance Metrics We are committed to helping customers save money and live better through everyday low prices, supported by everyday low costs. At times, we adjust our business strategies to maintain and strengthen our competitive positions in the countries in which we operate. Our financial framework is defined as: ##TABLE_START  strong, efficient growth; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  operating discipline; and ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  strategic capital allocation. ##TABLE_END As we execute on this financial framework, we believe our returns on capital will improve over time. Strong, Efficient Growth Our objective of prioritizing strong, efficient growth means we will focus on increasing comparable sales and eCommerce sales growth while slowing the rate of growth of new stores and clubs. At times, we make strategic investments which are focused on the long-term growth of the Company, which may not benefit comparable sales in the near term. Comparable sales is a metric which indicates the performance of our existing stores and clubs by measuring the change in sales for such stores and clubs, including eCommerce sales, for a particular period over the corresponding period in the previous year. The retail industry generally reports comparable sales using the retail calendar (also known as the 4-5-4 calendar). To be consistent with the retail industry, we provide comparable sales using the retail calendar in our quarterly earnings releases. However, when we discuss our comparable sales below, we are referring to our calendar comparable sales calculated using our fiscal calendar. As our fiscal calendar differs from the retail calendar, our fiscal calendar comparable sales also differ from the retail calendar comparable sales provided in our quarterly earnings releases. Calendar comparable sales, as well as the impact of fuel, for fiscal 2018 and 2017 , were as follows: ##TABLE_START   Fiscal Years Ended January 31,        With Fuel  Fuel Impact Walmart U.S.  2.1%  1.6%  0.1%  0.0% Sam's Club  2.8%  0.5%  1.0%  (0.9)% Total U.S.  2.2%  1.4%  0.2%  (0.1)% ##TABLE_ENDComparable sales in the U.S., including fuel,  increased 2.2% and 1.4% in fiscal 2018 and 2017 , respectively, when compared to the previous fiscal year. The fiscal 2018 total U.S. comparable sales were positively impacted by continued traffic improvement, higher eCommerce sales and the impact of higher fuel sales. eCommerce sales positively impacted comparable sales approximately 0.7% for both Walmart U.S. and Sam's Club for fiscal 2018 . The fiscal 2017 total U.S. comparable sales were positively impacted by continued traffic improvement and higher eCommerce sales at the Walmart U.S. segment, partially offset by the negative impact of lower fuel sales primarily due to lower fuel prices at the Sam's Club segment. eCommerce sales positively impacted comparable sales approximately 0.4% and 0.7% for Walmart U.S. and Sam's Club, respectively, for fiscal 2017 . In the past, when we were focused on adding new stores and clubs in the U.S., we did so with an understanding that additional stores and clubs may take sales away from existing units. We reduced the number of new store and club openings in fiscal 2018 and the negative impact on comparable sales as a result of these openings was not significant. We expect this trend to continue in the future as well. In fiscal 2017 , we estimate the negative impact on comparable sales as a result of opening new stores and clubs was approximately 0.7%. Our estimate was calculated primarily by comparing the sales trends of the impacted stores and clubs, which are identified based on their proximity to the new stores and clubs, to those of nearby non-impacted stores and clubs, in each case, as measured after the new stores and clubs are opened. Operating Discipline We operate with discipline by managing expenses and optimizing the efficiency of how we work. We measure operating discipline through expense leverage, which we define as net sales growing at a faster rate than operating expenses. ##TABLE_START   Fiscal Years Ended January 31, (Amounts in millions, except unit counts)   Net sales  $ 495,761  $ 481,317 Percentage change from comparable period  3.0 %  0.6 % Operating, selling, general and administrative expenses  $ 106,510  $ 101,853 Percentage change from comparable period  4.6 %  5.0 % Operating, selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales  21.5 %  21.2 % ##TABLE_ENDFor fiscal 2018 , operating, selling, general and administrative (\"operating\") expenses as a percentage of net sales increased 32  basis points, when compared to the same period in the previous fiscal year. While our increase in net sales and improving expense management had a positive impact on our operating expenses as a percentage of net sales, we did not leverage expenses as a result of approximately $0.6 billion of charges related to Sam's Club closures and discontinued real estate projects, approximately $400 million related to a lump sum bonus paid to associates, $300 million related to Home Office severance, a legal accrual of $283 million related to the FCPA matter, a charge of $244 million related to Walmart U.S. discontinued real estate projects, and the decisions to exit certain international properties and wind down the first party Brazil eCommerce operations. Strategic Capital Allocation We are allocating more capital to remodels, eCommerce, technology and supply chain and less to new store and club openings, when compared to prior years. This allocation aligns with our initiatives of improving our customer proposition in stores and clubs and integrating digital and physical shopping. The following table provides additional detail: ##TABLE_START (Amounts in millions)  Fiscal Years Ended January 31, Allocation of Capital Expenditures   New stores and clubs, including expansions and relocations  $  $ 2,171 Remodels  2,009  1,589 eCommerce, technology, supply chain and other  4,521  4,162 Total U.S.  7,444  7,922 Walmart International  2,607  2,697 Total capital expenditures  $ 10,051  $ 10,619 ##TABLE_ENDTotal U.S. capital expenditures decreased $478 million for fiscal 2018 , when compared to the previous fiscal year. Capital expenditures related to new stores and clubs, including expansions and relocations, decreased $1.3 billion , partially offset by increases to capital expenditures for remodels and for eCommerce, technology, supply chain and other. These changes were a result of our shift in capital allocation strategy to support growth in comparable store and club sales and eCommerce, while slowing the rate at which we open new stores and clubs. Returns As we execute our financial framework, we believe our returns on capital will improve over time. We measure returns on capital with our return on investment and free cash flow metrics. In addition, we provide returns in the form of share repurchases and dividends, which are discussed in the Liquidity and Capital Resources section. Return on Assets and Return on Investment We include Return on Assets (\"ROA\"), the most directly comparable measure based on our financial statements presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the U.S. (\"GAAP\"), and Return on Investment (\"ROI\") as metrics to assess returns on assets. While ROI is considered a non-GAAP financial measure, management believes ROI is a meaningful metric to share with investors because it helps investors assess how effectively Walmart is deploying its assets. Trends in ROI can fluctuate over time as management balances long-term potential strategic initiatives with possible short-term impacts. ROA was 5.2% and 7.2% for the fiscal years ended January 31, 2018 and 2017 , respectively. The decline in ROA was primarily due to the loss on extinguishment of debt and the decrease in operating income for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2018 . ROI was 14.2% and 15.2% for the fiscal years ended January 31, 2018 and 2017 , respectively. The decline in ROI was primarily due to the decrease in operating income for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2018 . We define ROI as adjusted operating income (operating income plus interest income, depreciation and amortization, and rent expense) for the fiscal year or trailing 12 months divided by average invested capital during that period. We consider average invested capital to be the average of our beginning and ending total assets, plus average accumulated depreciation and average accumulated amortization, less average accounts payable and average accrued liabilities for that period, plus a rent factor equal to the rent for the fiscal year or trailing 12 months multiplied by a factor of eight. When we have discontinued operations, we exclude the impact of the discontinued operations. Our calculation of ROI is considered a non-GAAP financial measure because we calculate ROI using financial measures that exclude and include amounts that are included and excluded in the most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP. For example, we exclude the impact of depreciation and amortization from our reported operating income in calculating the numerator of our calculation of ROI. In addition, we include a factor of eight for rent expense that estimates the hypothetical capitalization of our operating leases. As mentioned above, we consider ROA to be the financial measure computed in accordance with GAAP that is the most directly comparable financial measure to our calculation of ROI. ROI differs from ROA (which is consolidated net income for the period divided by average total assets for the period) because ROI: adjusts operating income to exclude certain expense items and adds interest income; adjusts total assets for the impact of accumulated depreciation and amortization, accounts payable and accrued liabilities; and incorporates a factor of rent to arrive at total invested capital. Because of the adjustments mentioned above, we believe ROI more accurately measures how we are deploying our key assets and is more meaningful to investors than ROA. Although ROI is a standard financial metric, numerous methods exist for calculating a company's ROI. As a result, the method used by management to calculate our ROI may differ from the methods used by other companies to calculate their ROI. The calculation of ROA and ROI, along with a reconciliation of ROI to the calculation of ROA, the most comparable GAAP financial measure, is as follows: ##TABLE_START   Fiscal Years Ended January 31, (Amounts in millions)   CALCULATION OF RETURN ON ASSETS Numerator     Consolidated net income  $ 10,523  $ 14,293 Denominator     Average total assets (1)  $ 201,674  $ 199,203 Return on assets (ROA)  5.2 %  7.2 %      CALCULATION OF RETURN ON INVESTMENT Numerator     Operating income  $ 20,437  $ 22,764 + Interest income   + Depreciation and amortization  10,529  10,080 + Rent  2,932  2,612 = Adjusted operating income  $ 34,050  $ 35,556      Denominator     Average total assets (1)  $ 201,674  $ 199,203 + Average accumulated depreciation and amortization (1)  79,995  74,245 - Average accounts payable (1)  43,763  39,960 - Average accrued liabilities (1)  21,388  20,131 + Rent x 8  23,456  20,896 = Average invested capital  $ 239,974  $ 234,253 Return on investment (ROI)  14.2 %  15.2 % ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START   As of January 31,     Certain Balance Sheet Data       Total assets  $ 204,522  $ 198,825  $ 199,581 Accumulated depreciation and amortization  83,039  76,951  71,538 Accounts payable  46,092  41,433  38,487 Accrued liabilities  22,122  20,654  19,607 ##TABLE_END(1) The average is based on the addition of the account balance at the end of the current period to the account balance at the end of the prior period and dividing by 2. Free Cash Flow Free cash flow is considered a non-GAAP financial measure.  Management believes, however, that free cash flow, which measures our ability to generate additional cash from our business operations, is an important financial measure for use in evaluating the Company's financial performance. Free cash flow should be considered in addition to, rather than as a substitute for, consolidated net income as a measure of our performance and net cash provided by operating activities as a measure of our liquidity. See Liquidity and Capital Resources for discussions of GAAP metrics including net cash provided by operating activities, net cash used in investing activities and net cash used in financing activities. We define free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities in a period minus payments for property and equipment made in that period. We had net cash provided by operating activities of $28.3 billion , $31.7 billion and $27.6 billion for fiscal 2018 , 2017 and 2016 , respectively. We generated free cash flow of $18.3 billion , $21.1 billion and $16.1 billion for fiscal 2018 , 2017 and 2016 , respectively. The decreases in net cash provided by operating activities and free cash flow in fiscal 2018 from fiscal 2017 were primarily due to the timing of tax and other payments, as well as lapping the previous year's improvements in working capital management and the benefit from the application of tax regulations adopted in fiscal 2017. The increase in net cash provided by operating activities and free cash flow in fiscal 2017 from fiscal 2016 was primarily due to improved working capital management. Additionally, we benefited from the application of new tax regulations related to the accelerated deduction of remodels and related expenses. Walmart's definition of free cash flow is limited in that it does not represent residual cash flows available for discretionary expenditures due to the fact that the measure does not deduct the payments required for debt service and other contractual obligations or payments made for business acquisitions. Therefore, we believe it is important to view free cash flow as a measure that provides supplemental information to our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows . Although other companies report their free cash flow, numerous methods may exist for calculating a company's free cash flow. As a result, the method used by Walmart's management to calculate our free cash flow may differ from the methods used by other companies to calculate their free cash flow. The following table sets forth a reconciliation of free cash flow, a non-GAAP financial measure, to net cash provided by operating activities, which we believe to be the GAAP financial measure most directly comparable to free cash flow, as well as information regarding net cash used in investing activities and net cash used in financing activities: ##TABLE_START   Fiscal Years Ended January 31, (Amounts in millions)    Net cash provided by operating activities  $ 28,337  $ 31,673  $ 27,552 Payments for property and equipment  (10,051 )  (10,619 )  (11,477 ) Free cash flow  $ 18,286  $ 21,054  $ 16,075        Net cash used in investing activities (1)  $ (9,060 )  $ (13,987 )  $ (10,675 ) Net cash used in financing activities  (19,875 )  (19,072 )  (16,285 ) ##TABLE_END(1) \"Net cash used in investing activities\" includes payments for property and equipment, which is also included in our computation of free cash flow. Results of Operations Consolidated Results of Operations ##TABLE_START   Fiscal Years Ended January 31, (Amounts in millions, except unit counts)    Total revenues  $ 500,343  $ 485,873  $ 482,130 Percentage change from comparable period  3.0 %  0.8 %  (0.7 )% Net sales  $ 495,761  $ 481,317  $ 478,614 Percentage change from comparable period  3.0 %  0.6 %  (0.7 )% Total U.S. calendar comparable sales increase  2.2 %  1.4 %  0.3 % Gross profit rate  24.7 %  24.9 %  24.6 % Operating income  $ 20,437  $ 22,764  $ 24,105 Operating income as a percentage of net sales  4.1 %  4.7 %  5.0 % Consolidated net income  $ 10,523  $ 14,293  $ 15,080 Unit counts at period end  11,718  11,695  11,528 Retail square feet at period end  1,158  1,164  1,149 ##TABLE_ENDOur total revenues, which are mostly comprised of net sales, but also include membership and other income, increased $14.5 billion or 3.0% and $3.7 billion or 0.8% for fiscal 2018 and 2017 , respectively, when compared to the previous fiscal year. Net sales  increased $14.4 billion or 3.0%  and $2 .7 billion or 0.6% for fiscal 2018 and 2017 , respectively, when compared to the previous fiscal year. For fiscal 2018 , net sales were positively impacted by overall positive comparable sales, the impact from new store openings and sales generated from eCommerce acquisitions . Additionally, for fiscal 2018 , the increase in net sales was partially offset by a reduction in net sales of $1.9 billion due to divesting our Yihaodian and Suburbia businesses and the $0.5 billion of negative impact from fluctuations in currency exchange rates. For fiscal 2017 , net sales were positively impacted by overall positive comparable sales and the 1.3% year-over-year growth in consolidated retail square feet. The positive effect of such factors on our consolidated net sales for fiscal 2017 was partially offset by a negative impact of $11.0 billion or 2.3% as a result of fluctuations in currency exchange rates and a $0.4 billion decrease in fuel sales from lower fuel prices at the Sam's Club segment. Our gross profit rate decreased 26 basis points for fiscal 2018 and increased 36 basis points for fiscal 2017 , when compared to the previous fiscal year. For fiscal 2018 , the decrease was primarily due to strategic price investments and the mix impact from eCommerce. For fiscal 2017 , the increase in gross profit rate was primarily due to improved margin in food and consumables, including the impact of savings in procuring merchandise and lower transportation expense from lower fuel costs in the Walmart U.S. segment. Additionally, improvement in certain markets' inventory management and cost analytics programs in the Walmart International segment also positively impacted our gross profit rate for fiscal 2017 . Operating expenses as a percentage of net sales increased 32 and 88 basis points for fiscal 2018 and 2017 , respectively, when compared to the previous fiscal year. For fiscal 2018 , the increase in operating expenses as a percentage of net sales was primarily due to approximately $0.6 billion in charges related to Sam's Club closures and discontinued real estate projects, approximately $400 million related to a lump sum bonus paid to associates, $300 million related to Home Office severance, a legal accrual of $283 million related to the FCPA matter in the third quarter, a charge of $244 million related to discontinued real estate projects in Walmart U.S., and the decisions to exit certain international properties and wind down the first party Brazil eCommerce operations. For fiscal 2017 , the increase in operating expenses as a percentage of net sales was primarily due to an increase in wage expense at the Walmart U.S. and Sam's Club segments resulting from the continued investment in associate wage structure, a $370 million charge related to discontinued domestic real estate projects and severance, and our continued investments in eCommerce and technology. The increase in operating expenses as a percentage of net sales for fiscal 2017 was partially offset by the impact of store closures in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016. Membership and other income was relatively flat for fiscal 2018 and increased $1.0 billion for fiscal 2017 , when compared to the same period in the previous fiscal year. While fiscal 2018 included a $387 million gain from the sale of Suburbia, a $47 million gain from a land sale, higher recycling income from our sustainability efforts and higher membership income from increased Plus Member penetration at Sam's Club, these gains were less than gains recognized in fiscal  2017 . Fiscal 2017 included a $535 million gain from the sale of our Yihaodian business and a $194 million gain from the sale of shopping malls in Chile. For fiscal 2018, loss on extinguishment of debt was $3.1 billion , due to the early extinguishment of long-term debt which allowed us to retire higher rate debt to reduce interest expense in future periods . Our effective income tax rate was 30.4% for fiscal 2018 and 30.3% for both fiscal 2017 and 2016 . Although relatively consistent year-over-year, our effective income tax rate may fluctuate from period to period as a result of factors including changes in our assessment of certain tax contingencies, valuation allowances, changes in tax laws, outcomes of administrative audits, the impact of discrete items and the mix of earnings among our U.S. operations and international operations. The reconciliation from the U.S. statutory rate to the effective income tax rates for fiscal 2018 , 2017 and 2016 is presented in Note 9 in the \" Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements \" and describes the impact of the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the \"Tax Act\") to the fiscal 2018 effective income tax rate. As a result of the factors discussed above, we reported $10.5 billion and $14.3 billion of consolidated net income for fiscal 2018 and 2017 , respectively, which represents a decrease of $3.8 billion and $0.8 billion for fiscal 2018 and 2017 , respectively, when compared to the previous fiscal year. Diluted net income per common share attributable to Walmart (\"EPS\") was $3.28 and $4.38 for fiscal 2018 and 2017 , respectively. Walmart U.S. Segment ##TABLE_START   Fiscal Years Ended January 31, (Amounts in millions, except unit counts)    Net sales  $ 318,477  $ 307,833  $ 298,378 Percentage change from comparable period  3.5 % 3.2 %  3.6 % Calendar comparable sales increase  2.1 %  1.6 %  1.0 % Operating income  $ 17,869  $ 17,745  $ 19,087 Operating income as a percentage of net sales  5.6 %  5.8 %  6.4 % Unit counts at period end  4,761 4,672  4,574 Retail square feet at period end  699  ##TABLE_ENDNet sales for the Walmart U.S. segment increased $10.6 billion or 3.5% and $9.5 billion or 3.2% for fiscal 2018 and 2017 , respectively, when compared to the previous fiscal year. The increases in net sales were primarily due to increases in comparable store sales of 2.1% and 1.6% for fiscal 2018 and 2017 , respectively, and year-over-year growth in retail square feet of 0.7% and 1.4% for fiscal 2018 and 2017 , respectively. Additionally, for fiscal 2018 , sales generated from eCommerce acquisitions further contributed to the year-over-year increase. Gross profit rate decreased 24 basis points for fiscal 2018 and increased 24 basis points for fiscal 2017 , when compared to the previous fiscal year. For fiscal 2018 , the decrease was primarily due to strategic price investments and the mix impact from eCommerce. Partially offsetting the negative factors for fiscal 2018 was the positive impact of savings from procuring merchandise. For fiscal 2017 , the increase in gross profit rate was primarily due to improved margin in food and consumables, including the impact of savings in procuring merchandise and lower transportation expense from lower fuel costs. Operating expenses as a percentage of segment net sales was relatively flat for fiscal 2018 and increased 101 basis points for fiscal 2017 , when compared to the previous fiscal year. Fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2017 included charges related to discontinued real estate projects of $244 million and $249 million, respectively. For fiscal 2017 , the increase was primarily driven by an increase in wage expense due to the investment in the associate wage structure; the charge related to discontinued real estate projects; and investments in digital retail and technology. The increase in operating expenses as a percentage of segment net sales for fiscal 2017 was partially offset by the impact of store closures in fiscal 2016. As a result of the factors discussed above, segment operating income increased $124 million for fiscal 2018 and decreased $1.3 billion for fiscal 2017 , respectively. Walmart International Segment ##TABLE_START   Fiscal Years Ended January 31, (Amounts in millions, except unit counts)    Net sales  $ 118,068  $ 116,119  $ 123,408 Percentage change from comparable period  1.7 %  (5.9 )%  (9.4 )% Operating income  $ 5,352  $ 5,758  $ 5,346 Operating income as a percentage of net sales  4.5 %  5.0 %  4.3 % Unit counts at period end  6,360 6,363  6,299 Retail square feet at period end  377  ##TABLE_ENDNet sales for the Walmart International segment increased $1.9 billion or 1.7% for fiscal 2018 and decreased $7.3 billion or 5.9% for fiscal 2017 , when compared to the previous fiscal year. For fiscal 2018 , the increase in net sales was due to positive comparable sales in the majority of our markets and the impact of new stores, partially offset by a reduction in net sales of $1.9 billion due to divesting our Yihaodian and Suburbia businesses and a $0.5 billion negative impact from fluctuations in currency exchange rates. For fiscal 2017 , the decrease in net sales was due to a $11.0 billion negative impact from fluctuations in currency exchange rates. Additionally, net sales for fiscal 2017 were impacted by positive comparable sales in all of our markets, except in the United Kingdom, and year-over-year growth in retail square feet of 1.2%. Gross profit rate decreased 28 basis points for fiscal 2018 and increased 46 basis points for fiscal 2017 , when compared to the previous fiscal year. For fiscal 2018 , the decrease in the gross profit rate was primarily due to strategic price investments in certain markets. For fiscal 2017 , the increase in gross profit rate was primarily due to improvement in certain markets' inventory management and cost analytics programs. Membership and other income decreased 14.0% for fiscal 2018 and increased 69.4% for fiscal 2017 , when compared to the previous fiscal year. While fiscal 2018 included a $387 million gain from the sale of Suburbia and a $47 million gain from a land sale, these gains were less than gains recognized in fiscal  2017 . Fiscal 2017  included a $535 million gain from the sale of our Yihaodian business and a $194 million gain from the sale of shopping malls in Chile . Operating expenses as a percentage of segment net sales decreased 11 basis points for fiscal 2018 and increased 58 basis points for fiscal 2017 , when compared to the previous fiscal year. The decrease in operating expenses as a percentage of segment net sales for fiscal 2018 was primarily due to an increase in net sales partially offset by restructuring and impairment charges in certain markets of approximately $0.5 billion, including charges from decisions to exit certain properties and to wind down the first party Brazil eCommerce operations. The increase in operating expenses as a percentage of segment net sales for fiscal 2017 was primarily due to declining sales on relatively flat fixed costs in the United Kingdom, as well as adjustments to useful lives of certain assets and impairment charges in certain markets. Segment operating income was negatively impacted by fluctuations in currency exchange rates of $68 million and $642 million for fiscal 2018 and 2017 , respectively. As a result of the factors discussed above, segment operating income decreased $406 million for fiscal 2018 and increased $412 million for fiscal 2017 , respectively. Sam's Club Segment We believe the information in the below table under the caption \"Excluding Fuel\" is useful to investors because it permits investors to understand the effect of the Sam's Club segment's fuel sales on its results of operations, which are impacted by the volatility of fuel prices. Volatility in fuel prices may continue to impact the operating results of the Sam's Club segment in the future. ##TABLE_START   Fiscal Years Ended January 31, (Amounts in millions, except unit counts)    Including Fuel       Net sales  $ 59,216  $ 57,365  $ 56,828 Percentage change from comparable period  3.2 %  0.9 %  (2.1 )% Calendar comparable sales increase (decrease)  2.8 %  0.5 %  (3.2 )% Operating income  $  $ 1,671  $ 1,820 Operating income as a percentage of net sales  1.7 %  2.9 %  3.2 % Unit counts at period end  660  Retail square feet at period end  88         Excluding Fuel       Net sales  $ 54,456  $ 53,289  $ 52,330 Percentage change from comparable period  2.2 %  1.8 %  1.4 % Operating income  $  $ 1,619  $ 1,746 Operating income as a percentage of net sales  1.6 %  3.0 %  3.3 % ##TABLE_END Net sales for the Sam's Club segment increased $1.9 billion or 3.2% and $0.5 billion or 0.9% for fiscal 2018 and 2017 , respectively, when compared to the previous fiscal year. For fiscal 2018 , the increase in net sales was primarily due to an increase in comparable sales which were benefited by an increase of $0.7 billion in fuel sales from higher fuel prices in fiscal 2018 . For fiscal 2017 , the increase in net sales was primarily due to an increase in comparable sales without fuel driven by higher eCommerce sales, and a year-over-year increase in retail square feet of 0.9%, partially offset by a decrease of $0.4 billion in fuel sales primarily from lower fuel prices in fiscal 2017 . In the future, net sales will be negatively impacted by our decision to remove tobacco in certain clubs. Gross profit rate decreased 44 basis points for fiscal 2018 and increased 39 basis points for fiscal 2017 , when compared to the previous fiscal year. For fiscal 2018 , the decrease in gross profit rate was primarily due to the impact of markdowns to liquidate inventory related to the club closures, a reclassification of certain supply expenses from operating expenses to cost of goods sold, higher inventory shrink, increased shipping costs at samsclub.com and the investment in cash rewards. For fiscal 2017 , the increase in gross profit rate was primarily due to margin rate improvement in home and apparel, health and wellness, and grocery, partially offset by changes in merchandise mix and the growth of the Cash Rewards program. Membership and other income increased 2.3% for fiscal 2018 and decreased 6.5% for fiscal 2017 , when compared to the previous fiscal year. For fiscal 2018 , the increase in membership and other income was primarily due to higher recycling income from our sustainability efforts and an increase of 1.3% in membership income resulting from increased Plus Member penetration. For fiscal 2017 , the decrease was primarily due to a reduction in other income partially offset by an increase of 2.3% in membership income as a result of increased Plus Member renewals. Operating expenses as a percentage of segment net sales increased 80 and 49 basis points for fiscal 2018 and 2017 , respectively, when compared to the previous fiscal year. For fiscal 2018 , the increase in operating expenses as a percentage of segment net sales was primarily due to a charge of approximately $0.6 billion related to club closures and discontinued real estate projects. For fiscal 2017 , the increase in operating expenses as a percentage of segment net sales was primarily due to an increase in wage, benefit and incentive expenses from the investment in the associate wage structure, as well as our investments in eCommerce and technology and an increase in advertising expense. As a result of the factors discussed above, segment operating income decreased $689 million and $149 million f or fiscal  2018 and 2017 , respectively. Liquidity and Capital Resources Liquidity The strength and stability of our operations have historically supplied us with a significant source of liquidity. Our cash flows provided by operating activities, supplemented with our long-term debt and short-term borrowings, have been sufficient to fund our operations while allowing us to invest in activities that support the long-term growth of our operations. Generally, some or all of the remaining available cash flow has been used to fund the dividends on our common stock and share repurchases. We believe our sources of liquidity will continue to be adequate to fund operations, finance our global investment and expansion activities, pay dividends and fund our share repurchases for the foreseeable future. Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities ##TABLE_START   Fiscal Years Ended January 31, (Amounts in millions)    Net cash provided by operating activities  $ 28,337  $ 31,673  $ 27,552 ##TABLE_ENDNet cash provided by operating activities was $28.3 billion , $31.7 billion and $27.6 billion for fiscal 2018 , 2017 and 2016 , respectively. The decrease in net cash provided by operating activities for fiscal 2018 , when compared to the previous fiscal year, was due to the timing of tax and other payments, as well as lapping the previous year's improvements in working capital management and the benefit from the application of tax regulations adopted in fiscal 2017. The increase in net cash provided by operating activities for fiscal 2017 , when compared to the previous fiscal year, was primarily due to improved working capital management. Additionally, we benefited from the application of new tax regulations related to the accelerated deduction of remodels and related expenses.  Cash Equivalents and Working Capital Cash and cash equivalents were $6.8 billion and $6.9 billion at January 31, 2018 and 2017 , respectively. Our working capital deficit was $18.9 billion and $9.2 billion at January 31, 2018 and 2017 , respectively. The increase in our working capital deficit reflects an increase in short-term borrowings as part of our long-term debt extinguishment activity as well as improved procurement and inventory management. We generally operate with a working capital deficit due to our efficient use of cash in funding operations, consistent access to the capital markets and returns provided to our shareholders in the form of payments of cash dividends and share repurchases. We use intercompany financing arrangements in an effort to ensure cash can be made available in the country in which it is needed with the minimum cost possible. We do not believe it will be necessary to repatriate earnings held outside of the U.S. and anticipate our domestic liquidity needs will be met through cash flows provided by domestic operating activities, supplemented with long-term debt and short-term borrowings. Accordingly, we intend, with only certain exceptions, to continue to indefinitely reinvest our earnings held outside of the U.S. in our foreign operations. As part of U.S. tax reform enacted on December 22, 2017, we are currently assessing the impact of the new legislation, which can in turn, impact our assertion regarding any potential future repatriation. If our intentions with respect to reinvestment were to change, most of the amounts held within our foreign operations could be repatriated to the U.S., although any repatriation under new U.S. tax laws could be subject to incremental withholding taxes. We do not expect current local laws, other existing limitations or potential taxes on anticipated future repatriations of cash amounts held outside of the U.S. to have a material effect on our overall liquidity, financial condition or results of operations. As of January 31, 2018 and 2017 , cash and cash equivalents of $1.4 billion and $1.0 billion , respectively, may not be freely transferable to the U.S. due to local laws or other restrictions. Net Cash Used in Investing Activities ##TABLE_START   Fiscal Years Ended January 31, (Amounts in millions)    Net cash used in investing activities  $ (9,060 )  $ (13,987 )  $ (10,675 ) ##TABLE_ENDNet cash used in investing activities was $9.1 billion , $14.0 billion and $10.7 billion for fiscal 2018 , 2017 and 2016 , respectively, and generally consisted of payments to remodel existing stores and clubs, expand our eCommerce capabilities, invest in other technologies and add stores and clubs. Net cash used in investing activities decreased $4.9 billion for fiscal 2018 , when compared to the previous fiscal year. Fiscal 2018 included cash received of $1.0 billion from the sale of Suburbia in Mexico, while fiscal 2017 included our acquisition of Jet.com, Inc. (\"jet.com\") for approximately $2.4 billion and our purchase of $1.9 billion of available for sale securities in JD.com (\"JD\"). Net cash used in investing activities increased $3.3 billion for fiscal 2017 , when compared to the previous fiscal year, primarily due to our acquisition of jet.com and investment in JD, partially offset by $0.7 billion in cash received from the sales of shopping malls in Chile. Refer to Note 13 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for further details on our acquisition of jet.com and investment in JD. Additionally, refer to the \" Strategic Capital Allocation \" section in our Company Performance Metrics for capital expenditure detail for fiscal 2018 and 2017. We continued to focus on eCommerce, including a seamless omni-channel shopping experience, in each of our segments during fiscal 2018 . Our fiscal 2018 accomplishments in this area include growing \"Online Grocery\" to over 1,100 pickup locations in the U.S., new dedicated eCommerce fulfillment centers, two-day free shipping with no membership fee at Walmart U.S. and one-hour delivery from stores in China. Growth Activities For the fiscal year ending January 31, 2019 (\"fiscal 2019 \"), we project capital expenditures will be approximately $11.0 billion and involve: ##TABLE_START  in Walmart U.S., continuing to prioritize store remodels and digital experiences, with approximately 1,000 additional online grocery locations; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  in Walmart International, investing more in fulfillment capabilities in addition to new stores; and, ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  eCommerce investments that include enhanced supply chain capabilities. ##TABLE_END Globally, in fiscal 2019 , we expect to add approximately 280 new, expanded or relocated stores and clubs, with approximately 255 of those in Walmart International, focusing on key markets such as Mexico and China. Net Cash Used in Financing Activities ##TABLE_START   Fiscal Years Ended January 31, (Amounts in millions)    Net cash used in financing activities  $ (19,875 )  $ (19,072 )  $ (16,285 ) ##TABLE_ENDNet cash flows used in financing activities generally consist of transactions related to our short-term and long-term debt, financing obligations, dividends paid and the repurchase of Company stock. Transactions with noncontrolling interests are also classified as cash flows from financing activities. Net cash used in financing activities increased $0.8 billion and $2.8 billion for fiscal 2018 and 2017 , respectively, when compared to the same period in the previous fiscal year. Net cash used in financing activities for fiscal 2018 increased due to premiums paid for early extinguishment of debt. Net cash used in financing activities for fiscal 2017 increased primarily due to repurchases of Company stock partially offset by lower repayments of long-term debt. Further discussion of financing activities is provided by major category below. Short-term Borrowings Net cash flows provided by short-term borrowings increased $4.1 billion in fiscal 2018 and decreased $1.7 billion in fiscal 2017 , when compared to the balance at the end of the previous fiscal year. We generally utilize the liquidity provided by short-term borrowings to provide funding for our operations, dividend payments, share repurchases, capital expenditures and other cash requirements. For fiscal 2018 , the additional cash provided by short-term borrowings was primarily due to the timing of our January 2018 debt extinguishment. For fiscal 2017 , the decrease in net cash flows provided by short-term borrowings was due to improved cash flows from operations driven by working capital improvements and changes to tax regulations. The following table includes additional information related to the Company's short-term borrowings for fiscal 2018 , 2017 and 2016 : ##TABLE_START   Fiscal Years Ended January 31, (Amounts in millions)    Maximum amount outstanding at any month-end  $ 11,386  $ 9,493  $ 10,551 Average daily short-term borrowings  8,131  5,691  4,536 Annual weighted-average interest rate  1.3 %  1.8 %  1.5 % ##TABLE_ENDIn addition to our short-term borrowings, we also have various undrawn committed lines of credit in the U.S. that provide $12.5 billion and various undrawn committed lines of credit outside of the U.S. that provide approximately $4.0 billion of additional liquidity, if needed. Long-term Debt The following table provides the changes in our long-term debt for fiscal 2018 : ##TABLE_START (Amounts in millions)  Long-term debt due within one year  Long-term debt  Total Balances as of February 1, 2017  $ 2,256  $ 36,015  $ 38,271 Proceeds from issuance of long-term debt    7,476  7,476 Payments of long-term debt  (1,789 )  (11,272 )  (13,061 ) Reclassifications of long-term debt  3,224  (3,224 )   Other   1,050  1,097 Balances as of January 31, 2018  $ 3,738  $ 30,045  $ 33,783 ##TABLE_ENDOur total long-term debt decreased $4.5 billion for fiscal 2018 , primarily due to the extinguishment and maturities of certain long-term debt, partially offset by the issuance of long-term debt. The extinguishment of certain long-term debt allowed us to retire higher rate debt to reduce interest expense in future periods . Dividends Our total dividend payments were $6.1 billion , $6.2 billion and $6.3 billion for fiscal 2018 , 2017 and 2016 , respectively. On February 20, 2018 , the Board of Directors approved the fiscal 2019 annual dividend of $2.08 per share, an increase over the fiscal 2018 annual dividend of $2.04 per share. For fiscal 2019 , the annual dividend will be paid in four quarterly installments of $0.52 per share, according to the following record and payable dates: ##TABLE_START Record Date  Payable Date March 9, 2018  April 2, 2018 May 11, 2018  June 4, 2018 August 10, 2018  September 4, 2018 December 7, 2018  January 2, 2019 ##TABLE_ENDCompany Share Repurchase Program From time to time, we repurchase shares of our common stock under share repurchase programs authorized by the Company's Board of Directors. All repurchases made during the fiscal year prior to November 20, 2017 were made under the plan in effect at the beginning of fiscal 2018 . On October 9, 2017, the Board of Directors approved a new $20.0 billion share repurchase program which, beginning on November 20, 2017, replaced the previous share repurchase program. As of January 31, 2018 , authorization for $18.8 billion of share repurchases remained under the current share repurchase program. Any repurchased shares are constructively retired and returned to an unissued status. We regularly review share repurchase activity and consider several factors in determining when to execute share repurchases, including, among other things, current cash needs, capacity for leverage, cost of borrowings, our results of operations and the market price of our common stock. We anticipate that a significant majority of the ongoing share repurchase program will be funded through the Company's free cash flows. The following table provides, on a settlement date basis, the number of shares repurchased, average price paid per share and total amount paid for share repurchases for fiscal 2018 , 2017 and 2016 : ##TABLE_START   Fiscal Years Ended January 31, (Amounts in millions, except per share data)    Total number of shares repurchased  104.9  119.9  62.4 Average price paid per share  $ 79.11  $ 69.18  $ 65.90 Total amount paid for share repurchases  $ 8,296  $ 8,298  $ 4,112 ##TABLE_ENDShare repurchases were flat for fiscal 2018 and increased $4.2 billion for fiscal 2017 , respectively, when compared to the previous fiscal year. Significant Transactions with Noncontrolling Interests In fiscal 2016, as described in Note 13 to our Consolidated Financial Statements, we completed the purchase of all of the remaining noncontrolling interest in Yihaodian, our eCommerce operations in China, for approximately $760 million, using existing cash to complete the transaction. The Company subsequently sold Yihaodian to JD in fiscal 2017. Capital Resources We believe cash flows from operations, our current cash position and access to capital markets will continue to be sufficient to meet our anticipated operating cash needs, which include funding seasonal buildups in merchandise inventories and funding our capital expenditures, dividend payments and share repurchases. We have strong commercial paper and long-term debt ratings that have enabled and should continue to enable us to refinance our debt as it becomes due at favorable rates in capital markets. At January 31, 2018 , the ratings assigned to our commercial paper and rated series of our outstanding long-term debt were as follows: ##TABLE_START Rating agency  Commercial paper  Long-term debt Standard  Poor's  A-1+  AA Moody's Investors Service  P-1  Aa2 Fitch Ratings  F1+  AA ##TABLE_ENDCredit rating agencies review their ratings periodically and, therefore, the credit ratings assigned to us by each agency may be subject to revision at any time. Accordingly, we are not able to predict whether our current credit ratings will remain consistent over time. Factors that could affect our credit ratings include changes in our operating performance, the general economic environment, conditions in the retail industry, our financial position, including our total debt and capitalization, and changes in our business strategy. Any downgrade of our credit ratings by a credit rating agency could increase our future borrowing costs or impair our ability to access capital and credit markets on terms commercially acceptable to us. In addition, any downgrade of our current short-term credit ratings could impair our ability to access the commercial paper markets with the same flexibility that we have experienced historically, potentially requiring us to rely more heavily on more expensive types of debt financing. The credit rating agency ratings are not recommendations to buy, sell or hold our commercial paper or debt securities. Each rating may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating organization and should be evaluated independently of any other rating. Moreover, each credit rating is specific to the security to which it applies. Contractual Obligations The following table sets forth certain information concerning our obligations to make contractual future payments, such as debt and lease agreements, and certain contingent commitments as of January 31, 2018 : ##TABLE_START   Payments Due During Fiscal Years Ending January 31, (Amounts in millions) Total 2020-2021 2022-2023 Thereafter Recorded contractual obligations: Long-term debt (1) $ 33,783 $ 3,733 $ 5,250 $ 3,541 $ 21,259 Short-term borrowings 5,257 5,257    Capital lease and financing obligations (2) 9,930 1,039 1,929 1,539 5,423 Unrecorded contractual obligations: Non-cancelable operating leases (3) 15,366 1,933 3,250 2,539 7,644 Estimated interest on long-term debt 17,601 1,291 2,319 2,121 11,870 Trade and stand-by letters of credit 2,626 2,626    Purchase obligations 13,278 6,121 5,094 1,138 Total contractual obligations $ 97,841 $ 22,000 $ 17,842 $ 10,878 $ 47,121 ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (1) \"Long-term debt\" includes the fair value of our derivatives designated as fair value hedges. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (2) \"Capital lease and financing obligations\" includes executory costs and imputed interest related to capital lease and financing obligations that are not yet recorded. Refer to Note 11 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for more information. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (3) Represents minimum contractual obligation for non-cancelable leases with initial or remaining terms greater than 12 months as of January 31, 2018 . ##TABLE_END Additionally, the Company has $12.5 billion in undrawn committed lines of credit in the U.S. and approximately $4.0 billion of undrawn committed lines of credit outside of the U.S. which, if drawn upon, would be included in the current liabilities section of the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets. Estimated interest payments are based on our principal amounts and expected maturities of all debt outstanding at January 31, 2018 , and assumes interest rates remain at current levels for our variable rate debt. Purchase obligations include legally binding contracts, such as firm commitments for inventory and utility purchases, as well as commitments to make capital expenditures, software acquisition and license commitments and legally binding service contracts. For the purposes of this table, contractual obligations for the purchase of goods or services are defined as agreements that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms, including: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed, minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. Contracts that specify the Company will purchase all or a portion of its requirements of a specific product or service from a supplier, but do not include a fixed or minimum quantity, are excluded from the table above. Additionally, purchase orders for inventory are not included in the table above as purchase orders represent authorizations to purchase rather than binding agreements. Our purchase orders are based on our current inventory needs and are fulfilled by our suppliers within short time periods. We also enter into contracts for outsourced services; however, the obligations under these contracts are not significant and the contracts generally contain clauses allowing for cancellation without significant penalty. The expected timing for payment discussed above is estimated based on current information. Timing of payments and actual amounts paid may be different depending on the timing of receipt of goods or services or changes to agreed-upon amounts for some obligations. In addition to the amounts shown in the table above, $1.0 billion of unrecognized tax benefits are considered uncertain tax positions and have been recorded as liabilities. The timing of the payment, if any, associated with these liabilities is uncertain. Refer to Note 9 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion of unrecognized tax benefits. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements As of January 31, 2018 , we had no off-balance sheet arrangements that have, or are reasonably likely to have, a current or future material effect on our consolidated financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources.

Summary of Critical Accounting Estimates Management strives to report our financial results in a clear and understandable manner, although in some cases accounting and disclosure rules are complex and require us to use technical terminology. In preparing the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements, we follow accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. These principles require us to make certain estimates and apply judgments that affect our financial position and results of operations as reflected in our financial statements. These judgments and estimates are based on past events and expectations of future outcomes. Actual results may differ from our estimates. Management continually reviews our accounting policies, how they are applied and how they are reported and disclosed in our financial statements. Following is a summary of our critical accounting estimates and how they are applied in preparation of the financial statements. Inventories We value inventories at the lower of cost or market as determined primarily by the retail inventory method of accounting, using the last-in, first-out (\"LIFO\") method for Walmart U.S. segment's inventories. The inventory at the Walmart International segment is valued primarily by the retail inventory method of accounting, using the first-in, first-out (\"FIFO\") method. The retail inventory method of accounting results in inventory being valued at the lower of cost or market, since permanent markdowns are immediately recorded as a reduction of the retail value of inventory. The inventory at the Sam's Club segment is valued using the weighted-average cost LIFO method. Under the retail method of accounting, inventory is valued at the lower of cost or market, which is determined by applying a cost-to-retail ratio to each merchandise grouping's retail value. The FIFO cost-to-retail ratio is generally based on the fiscal year purchase activity. The cost-to-retail ratio for measuring any LIFO provision is based on the initial margin of the fiscal year purchase activity less the impact of any permanent markdowns. The retail method of accounting requires management to make certain judgments and estimates that may significantly impact the ending inventory valuation at cost, as well as the amount of gross profit recognized. Judgments made include recording markdowns used to sell inventory and shrinkage. When management determines the ability to sell inventory has diminished, markdowns for clearance activity and the related cost impact are recorded. Factors considered in the determination of markdowns include current and anticipated demand, customer preferences and age of merchandise, as well as seasonal and fashion trends. Changes in weather and customer preferences could also cause changes in the amount and timing of markdowns from year to year. When necessary, we record a LIFO provision for the estimated annual effect of inflation, and these estimates are adjusted to actual results determined at year-end. Our LIFO provision is calculated based on inventory levels, markup rates and internally generated retail price indices. As a measure of sensitivity, a 1% increase to our retail price indices would not have resulted in a decrease to the carrying value of inventory. At January 31, 2018 and 2017 , our inventories valued at LIFO approximated those inventories as if they were valued at FIFO. We provide for estimated inventory losses, or shrinkage, between physical inventory counts on the basis of a historical percentage of sales. Following annual inventory counts, the provision is adjusted to reflect updated historical results. Historically, our estimated inventory losses have been materially accurate when compared to annual inventory counts and we expect that trend to continue. Impairment of Assets We evaluate long-lived assets, other than goodwill and assets with indefinite lives, for indicators of impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate their carrying amounts may not be recoverable. Management's judgments regarding the existence of impairment indicators are based on market conditions and financial performance. The evaluation of long-lived assets is performed at the lowest level of identifiable cash flows, which is generally at the individual store level. The variability of these factors depends on a number of conditions, including uncertainty about future events and changes in demographics. Thus, our accounting estimates may change from period to period. These factors could cause management to conclude that indicators of impairment exist and require impairment tests be performed, which could result in management determining the value of long-lived assets is impaired, resulting in a write-down of the related long-lived assets. Although impairment charges for fiscal 2018 were $1.4 billion , these charges primarily related to restructuring activities described in  Note 14 , as well as discontinued real estate projects in the U.S. and decisions to exit certain international properties . Impairment charges not related to restructuring activities or decisions to exit properties for fiscal 2018 were not material and would not change materially with a 10% decrease in the undiscounted cash flows for the stores with indicators of impairment. Additionally, total impairment charges for fiscal  2017 were not material. Goodwill and other indefinite-lived acquired intangible assets are not amortized, but are evaluated for impairment annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the value of a certain asset may be impaired. Generally, this evaluation begins with a qualitative assessment to determine whether a quantitative impairment test is necessary. If we determine, after performing an assessment based on the qualitative factors, that the fair value of the reporting unit is more likely than not less than the carrying amount, or that a fair value of the reporting unit substantially in excess of the carrying amount cannot be assured, then a quantitative impairment test would be performed. The quantitative test for impairment requires management to make judgments relating to future cash flows, growth rates and economic and market conditions. These evaluations are based on determining the fair value of a reporting unit or asset using a valuation method such as discounted cash flow or a relative, market-based approach. Historically, our reporting units and other indefinite-lived acquired intangible assets have generated sufficient returns to recover the cost of goodwill and other indefinite-lived acquired intangible assets. Because of the nature of the factors used in these tests, if different conditions occur in future periods, future operating results could be materially impacted. For approximately $300 million of certain acquired indefinite-lived intangible assets, the fair value approximated the carrying value; any deterioration in the fair value may result in an impairment charge. Income Taxes Income taxes have a significant effect on our net earnings. We are subject to income taxes in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Accordingly, the determination of our provision for income taxes requires significant judgment, the use of estimates and the interpretation and application of complex tax laws. Our effective income tax rate is affected by many factors, including changes in our assessment of certain tax contingencies, increases and decreases in valuation allowances, changes in tax law, outcomes of administrative audits, the impact of discrete items and the mix of earnings among our U.S. and international operations where the statutory rates are generally lower than the U.S. statutory rate, and may fluctuate as a result. Our tax returns are routinely audited and settlements of issues raised in these audits sometimes affect our tax provisions. The benefits of uncertain tax positions are recorded in our financial statements only after determining a more likely than not probability that the uncertain tax positions will withstand challenge, if any, from taxing authorities. When facts and circumstances change, we reassess these probabilities and record any changes in the financial statements as appropriate. We account for uncertain tax positions by determining the minimum recognition threshold that a tax position is required to meet before being recognized in the financial statements. This determination requires the use of significant judgment in evaluating our tax positions and assessing the timing and amounts of deductible and taxable items. Deferred tax assets represent amounts available to reduce income taxes payable on taxable income in future years. Such assets arise because of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities, as well as from net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets are evaluated for future realization and reduced by a valuation allowance to the extent that a portion is not more likely than not to be realized. Many factors are considered when assessing whether it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will be realized, including recent cumulative earnings, expectations of future taxable income, carryforward periods and other relevant quantitative and qualitative factors. The recoverability of the deferred tax assets is evaluated by assessing the adequacy of future expected taxable income from all sources, including reversal of taxable temporary differences, forecasted operating earnings and available tax planning strategies. This evaluation relies heavily on estimates. On December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the \"Tax Act\") was enacted and contains significant changes to U.S. income tax law. Effective in 2018, the Tax Act reduces the U.S. statutory tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent and creates new taxes on foreign-sourced earnings and related-party payments. In addition, the Company was subject to a one-time transition tax in fiscal 2018 on accumulated foreign subsidiary earnings not previously subject to U.S. income tax. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018, the Company recorded a net tax benefit of $0.2 billion related to the enactment of the Tax Act. The benefit primarily related to the remeasurement of the Company's deferred tax assets and liabilities considering the Tax Act's newly enacted tax rates and is net of the Tax Act's one-time transition tax on previously unremitted earnings of non-U.S. subsidiaries. As discussed in Note 9 to our Consolidated Financial Statements, as the Company collects and prepares necessary data, and interprets the Tax Act and any additional guidance issued by the U.S. Treasury Department, the IRS, and other standard-setting bodies, the Company may make adjustments to the provisional amounts. Those adjustments may materially impact our provision for income taxes and effective tax rate in the period in which the adjustments are made. The accounting for the tax effects of the Tax Act is provisional and will be completed by the measurement period provided in Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118. ##TABLE_START ", "7A": " ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK ##TABLE_ENDMarket Risk In addition to the risks inherent in our operations, we are exposed to certain market risks, including changes in interest rates and fluctuations in currency exchange rates. The analysis presented below for each of our market risk sensitive instruments is based on a hypothetical scenario used to calibrate potential risk and does not represent our view of future market changes. The effect of a change in a particular assumption is calculated without adjusting any other assumption. In reality, however, a change in one factor could cause a change in another, which may magnify or negate other sensitivities. Interest Rate Risk We are exposed to changes in interest rates as a result of our short-term borrowings and long-term debt issuances. We hedge a portion of our interest rate risk by managing the mix of fixed and variable rate debt and by entering into interest rate swaps. For fiscal 2018 , the net fair value of our interest rate swaps decreased approximately $87 million primarily due to fluctuations in market interest rates. The table below provides information about our financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in interest rates. For debt obligations, the table represents the principal cash flows and related weighted-average interest rates by expected maturity dates. For interest rate swaps, the table represents the contractual cash flows and weighted-average interest rates by the contractual maturity date, unless otherwise noted. The notional amounts are used to calculate contractual cash flows to be exchanged under the contracts. The weighted-average variable rates are based upon prevailing market rates at January 31, 2018 . ##TABLE_START   Expected Maturity Date (Amounts in millions)  Fiscal 2019  Fiscal 2020  Fiscal 2021  Fiscal 2022  Fiscal 2023  Thereafter  Total Liabilities               Short-term borrowings:               Variable rate  $ 5,257  $   $   $   $   $   $ 5,257 Weighted-average interest rate  1.5 %   %   %   %   %   %  1.5 % Long-term debt (1) :               Fixed rate  $ 3,233  $ 1,614  $ 3,336  $  $ 2,934  $ 21,259  $ 32,983 Weighted-average interest rate  3.2 %  2.6 %  2.8 %  5.5 %  1.7 %  4.6 %  3.9 % Variable rate  $  $  $   $   $   $   $ Weighted-average interest rate  5.5 %  1.7 %   %   %   %   %  4.1 % Interest rate derivatives               Interest rate swaps:               Fixed to variable  $   $   $  $   $   $ 3,250  $ 4,000 Weighted-average pay rate   %   %  3.2 %   %   %  2.5 %  2.6 % Weighted-average receive rate   %   %  3.3 %   %   %  2.9 %  3.0 % ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (1) The long-term debt amounts in the table exclude the Company's derivatives classified as fair value hedges. ##TABLE_END As of January 31, 2018 , our variable rate borrowings, including the effect of our commercial paper and interest rate swaps, represented 26% of our total short-term and long-term debt. Based on January 31, 2018 debt levels, a 100 basis point change in prevailing market rates would cause our annual interest costs to change by approximately $96 million . Foreign Currency Risk We are exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates as a result of our net investments and operations in countries other than the U.S. For fiscal 2018 , movements in currency exchange rates and the related impact on the translation of the balance sheets of the Company's subsidiaries in the United Kingdom and Canada were the primary cause of the $2.3 billion gain in the currency translation and other category of accumulated other comprehensive loss. We hedge a portion of our foreign currency risk by entering into currency swaps and designating certain foreign-currency-denominated long-term debt as net investment hedges. We hold currency swaps to hedge the currency exchange component of our net investments and also to hedge the currency exchange rate fluctuation exposure associated with the forecasted payments of principal and interest of non-U.S. denominated debt. The aggregate fair value of these swaps was in an asset position of $413 million at January 31, 2018 and a liability position of $147 million at January 31, 2017 . The change in the fair value of these swaps was due to fluctuations in currency exchange rates, primarily the strengthening of other currencies relative to the U.S. dollar in fiscal 2018 . A hypothetical 10% increase or decrease in the currency exchange rates underlying these swaps from the market rate at January 31, 2018 would have resulted in a loss or gain in the value of the swaps of $560 million . A hypothetical 10% change in interest rates underlying these swaps from the market rates in effect at January 31, 2018 would have resulted in a loss or gain in the value of the swaps of $22 million . In addition to currency swaps, we have designated foreign-currency-denominated long-term debt as nonderivative hedges of net investments of certain of our foreign operations. We had outstanding long-term debt of 1.7 billion at January 31, 2018 and 2.5 billion at January 31, 2017 that was designated as a hedge of our net investment in the United Kingdom. At January 31, 2018 , a hypothetical 10% increase or decrease in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to the British pound would have resulted in a change in the value of the debt of $217 million . In addition, we had outstanding long-term debt of 180 billion at January 31, 2018 and 10 billion at January 31, 2017 that was designated as a hedge of our net investment in Japan. At January 31, 2018 , a hypothetical 10% increase or decrease in value of the U.S. dollar relative to the Japanese yen would have resulted in a change in the value of the debt of $150 million . In certain countries, we also enter into immaterial foreign currency forward contracts to hedge the purchase and payment of purchase commitments denominated in non-functional currencies.

Management of Walmart Inc. (\"Walmart,\" the \"company\" or \"we\") is responsible for the preparation, integrity and objectivity of Walmart's Consolidated Financial Statements and other financial information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Those Consolidated Financial Statements were prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. In preparing those Consolidated Financial Statements, management is required to make certain estimates and judgments, which are based upon currently available information and management's view of current conditions and circumstances. The Audit Committee of the Board of Directors oversees our process of reporting financial information and the audit of our Consolidated Financial Statements. The Audit Committee stays informed of the financial condition of Walmart and regularly reviews management's financial policies and procedures, the independence of our independent auditors, our internal control over financial reporting and the objectivity of our financial reporting. Both the independent auditors and the internal auditors have free access to the Audit Committee and meet with the Audit Committee regularly, both with and without management present. Acting through our Audit Committee, we have retained Ernst  Young LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, to audit our Consolidated Financial Statements appearing below. We have made available to Ernst  Young LLP all of our financial records and related data in connection with their audit of our Consolidated Financial Statements. We have filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (\"SEC\") the required certifications related to our Consolidated Financial Statements as of and for the year ended January 31, 2018 . These certifications are attached as exhibits to this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Additionally, we have also provided to the New York Stock Exchange the required annual certification of our Chief Executive Officer regarding our compliance with the New York Stock Exchange's corporate governance listing standards. Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm To the Shareholders and the Board of Directors of Walmart Inc. Opinion on the Financial Statements We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Walmart Inc. (the Company) as of January 31, 2018 and 2017 , the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, shareholders' equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended January 31, 2018 , and the related notes (collectively referred to as the \"consolidated financial statements\"). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company at January 31, 2018 and 2017 , and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended January 31, 2018 , in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of January 31, 2018 , based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) and our report dated March 30, 2018 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon. Basis for Opinion These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. /s/ Ernst  Young LLP  We have served as the Company's auditor since 1969. Rogers, Arkansas March 30, 2018 Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm To the Shareholders and the Board of Directors of Walmart Inc. Opinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting We have audited Walmart Inc.'s internal control over financial reporting as of January 31, 2018 , based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the COSO criteria). In our opinion, Walmart Inc. (the Company) maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of January 31, 2018 , based on the COSO criteria. We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Walmart Inc. as of January 31, 2018 and 2017 , the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, shareholders' equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended January 31, 2018 , and the related notes and our report dated March 30, 2018 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon. Basis for Opinion The Company's management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting A company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. /s/ Ernst  Young LLP  Rogers, Arkansas March 30, 2018 Walmart Inc.

Walmart Inc. Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements Note 1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies General Walmart Inc. (formerly \"Wal-Mart Stores, Inc.\") (\"Walmart\" or the \"Company\") helps people around the world save money and live better  anytime and anywhere  in retail stores and through eCommerce. Through innovation, the Company is striving to create a customer-centric experience that seamlessly integrates digital and physical shopping into an omni-channel offering that saves time for its customers. Each week, the Company serves nearly 270 million customers who visit its more than 11,700 stores and numerous eCommerce websites under 65 banners in 28 countries. The Company's strategy is to lead on price, invest to differentiate on access, be competitive on assortment and deliver a great experience. The Company's operations comprise three reportable segments: Walmart U.S., Walmart International and Sam's Club. Principles of Consolidation The Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of Walmart and its subsidiaries as of and for the fiscal years ended January 31, 2018 (\"fiscal 2018 \"), January 31, 2017 (\"fiscal 2017 \") and January 31, 2016 (\"fiscal 2016 \"). All material intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. The Company consolidates variable interest entities where it has been determined that the Company is the primary beneficiary of those entities' operations. Investments in unconsolidated affiliates, which are 50% or less owned and do not otherwise meet consolidation requirements, are accounted for primarily using the equity method. These equity method investments are immaterial to the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements. The Company's Consolidated Financial Statements are based on a fiscal year ending on January 31 for the United States (\"U.S.\") and Canadian operations. The Company consolidates all other operations generally using a one-month lag and based on a calendar year. There were no significant intervening events during the month of January 2018 related to the operations consolidated using a lag that materially affected the Consolidated Financial Statements. Use of Estimates The Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Those principles require management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities. Management's estimates and assumptions also affect the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results may differ from those estimates. Cash and Cash Equivalents The Company considers investments with a maturity when purchased of three months or less to be cash equivalents. All credit card, debit card and electronic transfer transactions that process in less than seven days are classified as cash and cash equivalents. The amounts due from banks for these transactions classified as cash and cash equivalents totaled $1.6 billion and $1.5 billion at January 31, 2018 and 2017 , respectively. In addition, cash and cash equivalents included restricted cash of $300 million and $265 million at January 31, 2018 and 2017 , respectively, which was primarily related to cash collateral holdings from various counterparties, as required by certain derivative and trust agreements. The Company's cash balances are held in various locations around the world. Substantially all of the Company's $6.8 billion of cash and cash equivalents at January 31, 2018 , was held outside of the U.S. Of the Company's $6.9 billion of cash and cash equivalents at January 31, 2017 , $5.9 billion was held outside of the U.S. Cash and cash equivalents held outside of the U.S. are generally utilized to support liquidity needs in the Company's non-U.S. operations. The Company uses intercompany financing arrangements in an effort to ensure cash can be made available in the country in which it is needed with the minimum cost possible. Management does not believe it will be necessary to repatriate earnings held outside of the U.S. and anticipates the Company's domestic liquidity needs will be met through cash flows provided by domestic operating activities, supplemented with long-term debt and short-term borrowings. Accordingly, the Company intends, with only certain exceptions, to continue to indefinitely reinvest the Company's earnings held outside of the U.S. in its foreign operations. As part of the U.S. tax reform enacted on December 22, 2017, the Company is currently assessing the impact of the new legislation, which can in turn, impact its assertion regarding any potential future repatriation. If the Company's intentions with respect to reinvestment were to change, most of the amounts held within the Company's foreign operations could be repatriated to the U.S., although any repatriation under new U.S. tax laws could be subject to incremental withholding taxes. The Company does not expect current local laws, other existing limitations or potential taxes on anticipated future repatriations of earnings held outside of the U.S. to have a material effect on the Company's overall liquidity, financial condition or results of operations. As of January 31, 2018 and 2017 , cash and cash equivalents of approximately $1.4 billion and $1.0 billion , respectively, may not be freely transferable to the U.S. due to local laws or other restrictions. Receivables Receivables are stated at their carrying values, net of a reserve for doubtful accounts. Receivables consist primarily of amounts due from: ##TABLE_START  insurance companies resulting from pharmacy sales; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  banks for customer credit and debit cards and electronic bank transfers that take in excess of seven days to process; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  suppliers for marketing or incentive programs; and ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  real estate transactions. ##TABLE_END Inventories The Company values inventories at the lower of cost or market as determined primarily by the retail inventory method of accounting, using the last-in, first-out (\"LIFO\") method for Walmart U.S. segment's inventories. The inventory at the Walmart International segment is valued primarily by the retail inventory method of accounting, using the first-in, first-out (\"FIFO\") method. The retail inventory method of accounting results in inventory being valued at the lower of cost or market, since permanent markdowns are immediately recorded as a reduction of the retail value of inventory. The inventory at the Sam's Club segment is valued using the weighted-average cost LIFO method. At January 31, 2018 and January 31, 2017 , the Company's inventories valued at LIFO approximated those inventories as if they were valued at FIFO. Assets Held for Sale Assets held for sale represent components and businesses that meet accounting requirements to be classified as held for sale and are presented as single asset and liability amounts in the Company's financial statements with a valuation allowance, if necessary, to recognize the net carrying amount at the lower of cost or fair value, less cost to sell. The Company reviews all businesses and assets held for sale each reporting period to determine whether the existing carrying amounts are fully recoverable in comparison to estimated fair values. As of January 31, 2018 and 2017, immaterial amounts for assets and liabilities held for sale were classified within prepaid expenses and other and accrued liabilities, respectively, in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Property and Equipment Property and equipment are initially recorded at cost. Gains or losses on disposition are recognized as earned or incurred. Costs of major improvements are capitalized, while costs of normal repairs and maintenance are charged to expense as incurred. The following table summarizes the Company's property and equipment balances and includes the estimated useful lives that are generally used to depreciate the assets on a straight-line basis: ##TABLE_START     As of January 31, (Amounts in millions)  Estimated Useful Lives   Land  N/A  $ 25,298  $ 24,801 Buildings and improvements  3-40 years  101,155  98,547 Fixtures and equipment  1-30 years  52,695  48,998 Transportation equipment  3-15 years  2,387  2,845 Construction in progress  N/A  3,619  4,301 Property and equipment    $ 185,154  $ 179,492 Accumulated depreciation    (77,479 )  (71,782 ) Property and equipment, net    $ 107,675  $ 107,710 ##TABLE_ENDLeasehold improvements are depreciated or amortized over the shorter of the estimated useful life of the asset or the remaining expected lease term. Total depreciation and amortization expense for property and equipment, property under financing obligations and property under capital leases for fiscal 2018 , 2017 and 2016 was $10.5 billion , $10.1 billion and $9.5 billion , respectively. Leases The Company estimates the expected term of a lease by assuming the exercise of renewal options where an economic penalty exists that would preclude the abandonment of the lease at the end of the initial non-cancelable term and the exercise of such renewal is at the sole discretion of the Company. The expected term is used in the determination of whether a store or club lease is a capital or operating lease and in the calculation of straight-line rent expense. Additionally, the useful life of leasehold improvements is limited by the expected lease term or the economic life of the asset, whichever is shorter. If significant expenditures are made for leasehold improvements late in the expected term of a lease and renewal is reasonably assured, the useful life of the leasehold improvement is limited to the end of the renewal period or economic life of the asset, whichever is shorter. Rent abatements and escalations are considered in the calculation of minimum lease payments in the Company's capital lease tests and in determining straight-line rent expense for operating leases. The Company is often involved in the construction of its leased stores. In certain cases, payments made for certain structural components included in the lessor's construction of the leased assets result in the Company being deemed the owner of the leased assets for accounting purposes. As a result, the payments, regardless of the significance, are automatic indicators of ownership and require the Company to capitalize the lessor's total project cost with a corresponding financing obligation. Upon completion of the lessor's project, the Company performs a sale-leaseback analysis to determine if these assets and the related financing obligation can be derecognized from the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets. If the Company is deemed to have \"continuing involvement,\" the leased assets and the related financing obligation remain on the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets and are generally amortized over the lease term. At the end of the lease term, including exercise of any renewal options, the net remaining financing obligation over the net carrying value of the fixed asset will be recognized as a non-cash gain on sale of the property. Long-Lived Assets Long-lived assets are initially recorded at cost. Management reviews long-lived assets for indicators of impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. The evaluation is performed at the lowest level of identifiable cash flows, which is at the individual store or club level. Undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the related assets are estimated over the assets' useful lives based on updated projections. If the evaluation indicates that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable, any potential impairment is measured based upon the fair value of the related asset or asset group as determined by an appropriate market appraisal or other valuation technique. Goodwill and Other Acquired Intangible Assets Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of net assets acquired in business combinations and is allocated to the appropriate reporting unit when acquired. Other acquired intangible assets are stated at the fair value acquired as determined by a valuation technique commensurate with the intended use of the related asset. Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are not amortized; rather, they are evaluated for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the value of the asset may be impaired. Definite-lived intangible assets are considered long-lived assets and are amortized on a straight-line basis over the periods that expected economic benefits will be provided. Goodwill is evaluated for impairment using either a qualitative or quantitative approach for each of the Company's reporting units. Generally, a qualitative assessment is first performed to determine whether a quantitative goodwill impairment test is necessary. If management determines, after performing an assessment based on the qualitative factors, that the fair value of the reporting unit is more likely than not less than the carrying amount, or that a fair value of the reporting unit substantially in excess of the carrying amount cannot be assured, then a quantitative goodwill impairment test would be required. The quantitative test for goodwill impairment is performed by determining the fair value of the related reporting units. Fair value is measured based on the discounted cash flow method and relative market-based approaches. After evaluation, management determined the fair value of each reporting unit is greater than the carrying amount and, accordingly, the Company has not recorded any impairment charges related to goodwill. The following table reflects goodwill activity, by reportable segment, for fiscal 2018 and 2017 : ##TABLE_START (Amounts in millions)  Walmart U.S.  Walmart International  Sam's Club  Total Balances as of February 1, 2016  $  $ 15,921  $  $ 16,695 Changes in currency translation and other    (1,433 )    (1,433 ) Acquisitions (1)  1,775      1,775 Balances as of January 31, 2017  2,236  14,488   17,037 Changes in currency translation and other       Acquisitions       Balances as of January 31, 2018  $ 2,445  $ 15,484  $  $ 18,242 ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (1) Goodwill recorded for fiscal 2017 Walmart U.S. acquisitions primarily relates to Jet.com, Inc. (\"jet.com\"). ##TABLE_END Indefinite-lived intangible assets are included in other assets and deferred charges in the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets. These assets are evaluated for impairment based on their fair values using valuation techniques which are updated annually based on the most recent variables and assumptions. There were no significant impairment charges related to indefinite-lived intangible assets recorded for fiscal 2018 , 2017 and 2016 . Self Insurance Reserves The Company self-insures a number of risks, including, but not limited to, workers' compensation, general liability, auto liability, product liability and certain employee-related healthcare benefits . Standard actuarial procedures and data analysis are used to estimate the liabilities associated with these risks as of the balance sheet date on an undiscounted basis. The recorded liabilities reflect the ultimate cost for claims incurred but not paid and any estimable administrative run-out expenses related to the processing of these outstanding claim payments. On a regular basis, the liabilities are evaluated for appropriateness with claims reserve valuations provided by independent third-party actuaries. To limit exposure to some risks, the Company maintains insurance coverage with varying limits and retentions, including stop-loss insurance coverage for workers' compensation, general liability and auto liability. Income Taxes Income taxes are accounted for under the balance sheet method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases (\"temporary differences\"). Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rate is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. Deferred tax assets are evaluated for future realization and reduced by a valuation allowance to the extent that a portion is not more likely than not to be realized. Many factors are considered when assessing whether it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will be realized, including recent cumulative earnings, expectations of future taxable income, carryforward periods, and other relevant quantitative and qualitative factors. The recoverability of the deferred tax assets is evaluated by assessing the adequacy of future expected taxable income from all sources, including reversal of taxable temporary differences, forecasted operating earnings and available tax planning strategies. These sources of income rely heavily on estimates. In determining the provision for income taxes, an annual effective income tax rate is used based on annual income, permanent differences between book and tax income, and statutory income tax rates. Discrete events such as audit settlements or changes in tax laws are recognized in the period in which they occur. The Company records a liability for unrecognized tax benefits resulting from uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. The Company records interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in interest expense and operating, selling, general and administrative expenses, respectively, in the Company's Consolidated Statements of Income. Refer to Note 9 for additional income tax disclosures. Revenue Recognition  Sales The Company recognizes sales revenue, net of sales taxes and estimated sales returns, at the time it sells merchandise to the customer. eCommerce sales include shipping revenue and are recorded upon delivery to the customer. Additionally, estimated sales returns are calculated using historical experience of actual returns as a percent of sales. Membership Fee Revenue The Company recognizes membership fee revenue both in the U.S. and internationally over the term of the membership, which is typically 12 months. The following table summarizes membership fee activity for fiscal 2018 , 2017 and 2016 : ##TABLE_START   Fiscal Years Ended January 31, (Amounts in millions)    Deferred membership fee revenue, beginning of year  $  $  $ Cash received from members  1,398  1,371  1,333 Membership fee revenue recognized  (1,411 )  (1,372 )  (1,348 ) Deferred membership fee revenue, end of year  $  $  $ ##TABLE_ENDMembership fee revenue is included in membership and other income in the Company's Consolidated Statements of Income. The deferred membership fee is included in accrued liabilities in the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets. Gift Cards Customer purchases of gift cards, to be utilized in our stores or on our eCommerce websites, are not recognized as revenue until the card is redeemed and the customer purchases merchandise using the gift card. Gift cards in the U.S. and some countries do not carry an expiration date; therefore, customers and members can redeem their gift cards for merchandise indefinitely. Gift cards in some foreign countries where the Company does business have expiration dates. A certain number of gift cards, both with and without expiration dates, will not be fully redeemed. Management estimates unredeemed gift cards and recognizes revenue for these amounts when it is determined the likelihood of redemption is remote. Management periodically reviews and updates its estimates. Financial and Other Services The Company recognizes revenue from service transactions at the time the service is performed. Generally, revenue from services is classified as a component of net sales in the Company's Consolidated Statements of Income. Cost of Sales Cost of sales includes actual product cost, the cost of transportation to the Company's distribution facilities, stores and clubs from suppliers, the cost of transportation from the Company's distribution facilities to the stores, clubs and customers and the cost of warehousing for the Sam's Club segment and import distribution centers. Cost of sales is reduced by supplier payments that are not a reimbursement of specific, incremental and identifiable costs. Payments from Suppliers The Company receives consideration from suppliers for various programs, primarily volume incentives, warehouse allowances and reimbursements for specific programs such as markdowns, margin protection, advertising and supplier-specific fixtures. Payments from suppliers are accounted for as a reduction of cost of sales, except in certain limited situations when the payment is a reimbursement of specific, incremental and identifiable costs, and are recognized in the Company's Consolidated Statements of Income when the related inventory is sold. Operating, Selling, General and Administrative Expenses Operating, selling, general and administrative expenses include all operating costs of the Company, except cost of sales, as described above. As a result, the majority of the cost of warehousing and occupancy for the Walmart U.S. and Walmart International segments' distribution facilities is included in operating, selling, general and administrative expenses. Because the Company only includes a portion of the cost of its Walmart U.S. and Walmart International segments' distribution facilities in cost of sales, its gross profit and gross profit as a percentage of net sales may not be comparable to those of other retailers that may include all costs related to their distribution facilities in cost of sales and in the calculation of gross profit. Advertising Costs Advertising costs are expensed as incurred, consist primarily of print, television and digital advertisements and are recorded in operating, selling, general and administrative expenses in the Company's Consolidated Statements of Income. In certain limited situations, reimbursements from suppliers that are for specific, incremental and identifiable advertising costs are recognized as a reduction of advertising costs in operating, selling, general and administrative expenses. Advertising costs were $3.1 billion , $2.9 billion and $2.5 billion for fiscal 2018 , 2017 and 2016 , respectively. Pre-Opening Costs The cost of start-up activities, including organization costs, related to new store openings, store remodels, relocations, expansions and conversions are expensed as incurred and included in operating, selling, general and administrative expenses in the Company's Consolidated Statements of Income. Pre-opening costs totaled $106 million , $131 million and $271 million for fiscal 2018 , 2017 and 2016 , respectively. Currency Translation The assets and liabilities of all international subsidiaries are translated from the respective local currency to the U.S. dollar using exchange rates at the balance sheet date. Related translation adjustments are recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss. The Company's Consolidated Statements of Income of all international subsidiaries are translated from the respective local currencies to the U.S. dollar using average exchange rates for the period covered by the income statements. Recent Accounting Pronouncements Pronouncements Adopted in Fiscal 2018 In March 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (\"FASB\") issued Accounting Standards Update (\"ASU\") 2016-09, CompensationStock Compensation (Topic 718) , which is intended to simplify accounting for share-based payment transactions. The ASU changed several aspects of the accounting for share-based payment award transactions, including accounting for income taxes, forfeitures and minimum statutory tax withholding requirements. Management adopted this ASU beginning February 1, 2017, and as a result, reclassified an immaterial amount from operating activities to financing activities in the Company's prior year consolidated cash flows. On December 22, 2017, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) staff issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118, Income Tax Accounting Implications of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (\"SAB 118\"), in response to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (\"Tax Act\"). The Company has elected to record provisional amounts, as allowed by SAB 118, during a measurement period not to extend beyond one year of the enactment date. Management expects to complete the analysis within the measurement period in accordance with SAB 118. Pronouncements to Be Adopted in the Year Ending January 31, 2019 (\"fiscal 2019\") In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606). This ASU represents a single comprehensive model to recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to a customer at an amount that reflects the consideration it expects to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services. The Company adopted this ASU on February 1, 2018, under the modified retrospective approach, which resulted in an immaterial cumulative adjustment to retained earnings. Also, this ASU will require additional disclosures. In January 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-01, Financial InstrumentsOverall (Topic 825) , which updates certain aspects of recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of financial instruments. This ASU primarily impacts the Company's accounting for its investment in JD.com (\"JD\"). The Company adopted this ASU on February 1, 2018, which resulted in a cumulative positive adjustment to retained earnings of approximately $2.9 billion based on the market value of our investment in JD at January 31, 2018. The retained earnings adjustment relates to both the available for sale portion and the cost portion of the investment. Beginning February 1, 2018, the adoption requires the remeasurement of our investment in JD due to observable price changes and impairments, if any, to be recorded through the Consolidated Statement of Income, introducing volatility to reported net income. In November 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-18, Statement of Cash FlowsRestricted Cash (Topic 230) , which requires restricted cash to be included with cash and cash equivalents when reconciling the beginning and ending amounts on the statement of cash flows. The Company adopted this ASU on February 1, 2018, which, while immaterial, will modify the Company's presentation of Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. At January 31, 2018, the Company had restricted cash recorded in line items other than cash and cash equivalents of $258 million . In February 2018, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update ASU 2018-02, Income StatementReporting Comprehensive Income (Topic 220): Reclassification of Certain Tax Effects from Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income . The ASU provides that the stranded tax effects from the Tax Act in accumulated other comprehensive loss may be reclassified to retained earnings. The ASU is effective February 1, 2019, with early adoption permitted. Management anticipates early adopting this optional standard and is evaluating the effect on the Company's consolidated financial statements. Other Pronouncements Being Evaluated In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842) , which requires lease assets and liabilities to be recorded on the balance sheet. Certain qualitative and quantitative disclosures are also required, as well as retrospective recognition and measurement of impacted leases. The Company will adopt this ASU on February 1, 2019 and is implementing new lease systems in connection with the adoption. Management is progressing with implementation and continuing to evaluate the effect to the Company's consolidated financial statements and disclosures. Management expects a material impact to the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheet. In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13, Financial InstrumentsCredit Losses (Topic 326) , which modifies the measurement of expected credit losses of certain financial instruments. The Company will adopt this ASU on February 1, 2020. Management is currently evaluating this ASU to determine its impact to the Company's consolidated financial statements. Note 2. Net Income Per Common Share Basic net income per common share attributable to Walmart is based on the weighted-average common shares outstanding during the relevant period. Diluted net income per common share attributable to Walmart is based on the weighted-average common shares outstanding during the relevant period adjusted for the dilutive effect of share-based awards. The Company did not have significant share-based awards outstanding that were antidilutive and not included in the calculation of diluted net income per common share attributable to Walmart for fiscal 2018 , 2017 and 2016 . The following table provides a reconciliation of the numerators and denominators used to determine basic and diluted net income per common share attributable to Walmart: ##TABLE_START   Fiscal Years Ended January 31, (Amounts in millions, except per share data)    Numerator       Consolidated net income  $ 10,523  $ 14,293  $ 15,080 Consolidated net income attributable to noncontrolling interest  (661 )  (650 )  (386 ) Consolidated net income attributable to Walmart  $ 9,862  $ 13,643  $ 14,694        Denominator       Weighted-average common shares outstanding, basic  2,995  3,101  3,207 Dilutive impact of stock options and other share-based awards    Weighted-average common shares outstanding, diluted  3,010  3,112  3,217       Net income per common share attributable to Walmart       Basic  $ 3.29  $ 4.40  $ 4.58 Diluted  3.28  4.38  4.57 ##TABLE_ENDNote 3. Shareholders' Equity Share-Based Compensation The Company has awarded share-based compensation to associates and nonemployee directors of the Company. The compensation expense recognized for all plans was $626 million , $596 million and $448 million for fiscal 2018 , 2017 and 2016 , respectively. Share-based compensation expense is generally included in operating, selling, general and administrative expenses in the Company's Consolidated Statements of Income. The total income tax benefit recognized for share-based compensation was $150 million , $212 million and $151 million for fiscal 2018 , 2017 and 2016 , respectively. The following table summarizes the Company's share-based compensation expense by award type: ##TABLE_START  Fiscal Years Ended January 31, (Amounts in millions)   Restricted stock and performance share units $  $  $ Restricted stock units   Other   Share-based compensation expense $  $  $ ##TABLE_ENDThe Walmart Inc. Stock Incentive Plan of 2015 (the \"Plan\"), as amended and restated effective February 23, 2016, and as amended further as of February 1, 2017, and as renamed on February 1, 2018, was established to grant stock options, restricted (non-vested) stock, performance share units and other equity compensation awards for which 210 million shares of Walmart common stock issued or to be issued under the Plan have been registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. The Company believes that such awards serve to align the interests of its associates with those of its shareholders. The Plan's award types are summarized as follows: ##TABLE_START  Restricted Stock and Performance Share Units. Restricted stock awards are for shares that vest based on the passage of time and include restrictions related to employment. Performance share units vest based on the passage of time and achievement of performance criteria and may range from 0% to 150% of the original award amount. Vesting periods for these awards are generally between one and three years. Restricted stock and performance share units may be settled or deferred in stock and are accounted for as equity in the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets. The fair value of restricted stock awards is determined on the date of grant and is expensed ratably over the vesting period. The fair value of performance share units is determined on the date of grant using the Company's stock price discounted for the expected dividend yield through the vesting period and is recognized over the vesting period. The weighted-average discount for the dividend yield used to determine the fair value of performance share units in fiscal 2018 , 2017 and 2016 was 7.2% , 8.3% and 7.4% , respectively. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Restricted Stock Units. Restricted stock units provide rights to Company stock after a specified service period; generally 50% vest three years from the grant date and the remaining 50% vest five years from the grant date. The fair value of each restricted stock unit is determined on the date of grant using the stock price discounted for the expected dividend yield through the vesting period and is recognized ratably over the vesting period. The expected dividend yield is based on the anticipated dividends over the vesting period. The weighted-average discount for the dividend yield used to determine the fair value of restricted stock units granted in fiscal 2018 , 2017 and 2016 was 9.0% , 9.0% and 8.7% , respectively. ##TABLE_END In addition to the Plan, the Company's subsidiary in the United Kingdom has stock option plans for certain colleagues which generally vest over three years. The stock option share-based compensation expense is included in the Other line in the table above. The following table shows the activity for restricted stock and performance share units and restricted stock units during fiscal 2018 : ##TABLE_START   Restricted Stock and Performance Share Units (1)  Restricted Stock Units (Shares in thousands)  Shares  Weighted-Average Grant-Date Fair Value Per Share  Shares  Weighted-Average Grant-Date Fair Value Per Share Outstanding at February 1, 2017  9,077  $ 68.61  24,276  $ 65.52 Granted  3,598  74.73  8,570  67.54 Vested/exercised  (2,525 )  71.55  (5,440 )  63.02 Forfeited or expired  (1,592 )  68.59  (3,253 )  66.28 Outstanding at January 31, 2018  8,558  $ 70.47  24,153  $ 66.69 ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (1) Assumes payout rate at 100% for Performance Share Units. ##TABLE_END The following table includes additional information related to restricted stock and performance share units and restricted stock units:  ##TABLE_START  Fiscal Years Ended January 31, (Amounts in millions, except years)   Fair value of restricted stock and performance share units vested $  $  $ Fair value of restricted stock units vested   Unrecognized compensation cost for restricted stock and performance share units   Unrecognized compensation cost for restricted stock units   Weighted average remaining period to expense for restricted stock and performance share units (years) 1.2  1.3  1.3 Weighted average remaining period to expense for restricted stock units (years) 1.8  1.9  1.7 ##TABLE_ENDShare Repurchase Program From time to time, the Company repurchases shares of its common stock under share repurchase programs authorized by the Company's Board of Directors. All repurchases made during the fiscal year prior to November 20, 2017 were made under the plan in effect at the beginning of fiscal 2018. On October 9, 2017, the Board of Directors approved a new $20.0 billion share repurchase program which, beginning on November 20, 2017, replaced the previous share repurchase program. As of January 31, 2018 , authorization for $18.8 billion of share repurchases remained under the current share repurchase program. Any repurchased shares are constructively retired and returned to an unissued status. The Company considers several factors in determining when to execute share repurchases, including, among other things, current cash needs, capacity for leverage, cost of borrowings, its results of operations and the market price of its common stock. The following table provides, on a settlement date basis, the number of shares repurchased, average price paid per share and total amount paid for share repurchases for fiscal 2018 , 2017 and 2016 : ##TABLE_START   Fiscal Years Ended January 31, (Amounts in millions, except per share data)    Total number of shares repurchased  104.9  119.9  62.4 Average price paid per share  $ 79.11  $ 69.18  $ 65.90 Total cash paid for share repurchases  $ 8,296  $ 8,298  $ 4,112 ##TABLE_ENDNote 4.

Short-term Borrowings and Long-term Debt Short-term borrowings consist of commercial paper and lines of credit. Short-term borrowings at January 31, 2018 and 2017 were $5.3 billion and $1.1 billion , respectively, with weighted-average interest rates of 1.5% and 6.2% , respectively. The Company has various committed lines of credit in the U.S., committed with 23 financial institutions, totaling $12.5 billion as of January 31, 2018 and 2017 , respectively. These committed lines of credit are summarized in the following table: ##TABLE_START   As of January 31,    (Amounts in millions)  Available  Drawn  Undrawn  Available  Drawn  Undrawn Five-year credit facility (1)  $ 5,000  $   $ 5,000  $ 5,000  $   $ 5,000 364-day revolving credit facility (1)  7,500    7,500  7,500    7,500 Total  $ 12,500  $   $ 12,500  $ 12,500  $   $ 12,500 ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (1) In May 2017, the Company renewed and extended its existing five-year credit facility and its existing 364-day revolving credit facility, both of which are used to support its commercial paper program. ##TABLE_END The committed lines of credit in the table above mature at various times between May 2018 and May 2022 , carry interest rates generally ranging between LIBOR plus 10 basis points and LIBOR plus 75 basis points, and incur commitment fees ranging between 1.5 and 4.0 basis points. In conjunction with the committed lines of credit listed in the table above, the Company has agreed to observe certain covenants, the most restrictive of which relates to the maximum amount of secured debt. Additionally, the Company also maintains other committed lines of credit outside of the U.S. with an available and undrawn amount of approximately $4.0 billion as of January 31, 2018 . Apart from the committed lines of credit, the Company has trade and stand-by letters of credit totaling $2.6 billion and $3.6 billion at January 31, 2018 and 2017 , respectively. These letters of credit are utilized in normal business activities.

At January 31, 2018 and 2017 the Company had secured debt in the amount of $10 million and $14 million , respectively, which was collateralized by property that had an aggregate carrying amount of approximately $101 million and $82 million , respectively. ##TABLE_END At January 31, 2018 and 2017 , the Company had $500 million in debt with embedded put options. The issuance of money market puttable reset securities in the amount of $500 million is structured to be remarketed in connection with the annual reset of the interest rate. If, for any reason, the remarketing of the notes does not occur at the time of any interest rate reset, the holders of the notes must sell and the Company must repurchase the notes at par. Accordingly, this issuance has been classified as long-term debt due within one year in the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets. Annual maturities of long-term debt during the next five years and thereafter are as follows: ##TABLE_START (Amounts in millions) Annual Fiscal Year Maturities $ 3,733 1,914 3,336 607 2,934 Thereafter 21,259 Total $ 33,783 ##TABLE_ENDDebt Issuances Information on significant long-term debt issued during fiscal 2018 is as follows: ##TABLE_START (Amounts in millions)           Issue Date  Principal Amount  Maturity Date  Fixed vs. Floating  Interest Rate  Proceeds July 18, 2017  70,000 JPY  July 15, 2022  Fixed  0.183%  $ July 18, 2017  40,000 JPY  July 18, 2024  Fixed  0.298%  July 18, 2017  60,000 JPY  July 16, 2027  Fixed  0.520%  October 20, 2017  300 USD  October 9, 2019  Floating  Floating  October 20, 2017  1,200 USD  October 9, 2019  Fixed  1.750%  1,198 October 20, 2017  1,250 USD  December 15, 2020  Fixed  1.900%  1,245 October 20, 2017  1,250 USD  December 15, 2022  Fixed  2.350%  1,245 October 20, 2017  1,000 USD  December 15, 2024  Fixed  2.650%  October 20, 2017  1,000 USD  December 15, 2047  Fixed  3.625%  Total          $ 7,476 ##TABLE_ENDAs described in Note 8 , the current year issuances of foreign-currency-denominated long-term debt are designated as a hedge of the Company's net investment in Japan. The Company did not have any significant long-term debt issuances during fiscal 2017, but received some proceeds from a number of small long-term debt issuances by several of its non-U.S. operations.

Note 7. Fair Value Measurements The Company records and discloses certain financial and non-financial assets and liabilities at fair value. The fair value of an asset is the price at which the asset could be sold in an orderly transaction between unrelated, knowledgeable and willing parties able to engage in the transaction. The fair value of a liability is the amount that would be paid to transfer the liability to a new obligor in a transaction between such parties, not the amount that would be paid to settle the liability with the creditor. Assets and liabilities recorded at fair value are measured using the fair value hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value. The levels of the fair value hierarchy are: ##TABLE_START  Level 1: observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Level 2: inputs other than quoted prices in active markets that are either directly or indirectly observable; and ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Level 3: unobservable inputs for which little or no market data exists, therefore requiring the Company to develop its own assumptions. ##TABLE_END Recurring Fair Value Measurements The Company holds derivative instruments that are required to be measured at fair value on a recurring basis. The fair values are the estimated amounts the Company would receive or pay upon termination of the related derivative agreements as of the reporting dates. The fair values have been measured using the income approach and Level 2 inputs, which include the relevant interest rate and foreign currency forward curves. As of January 31, 2018 and 2017 , the notional amounts and fair values of these derivatives were as follows: ##TABLE_START  January 31, 2018  January 31, 2017 (Amounts in millions) Notional Amount  Fair Value  Notional Amount  Fair Value Receive fixed-rate, pay variable-rate interest rate swaps designated as fair value hedges $ 4,000  $ (91 )  $ 5,000  $ (4 ) Receive fixed-rate, pay fixed-rate cross-currency swaps designated as net investment hedges 2,250   2,250  Receive fixed-rate, pay fixed-rate cross-currency swaps designated as cash flow hedges 4,523   3,957  (618 ) Total $ 10,773  $  $ 11,207  $ (151 ) ##TABLE_ENDAdditionally, the Company's available-for-sale securities are measured at fair value on a recurring basis using Level 1 inputs. Changes in fair value are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss. The cost basis and fair value of the Company's available-for-sale securities as of January 31, 2018 and 2017 , are as follows: ##TABLE_START   January 31, 2018  January 31, 2017 (Amounts in millions)  Cost Basis  Fair Value  Cost Basis  Fair Value Available-for-sale securities  $ 1,901  $ 3,547  $ 1,901  $ 2,046 ##TABLE_ENDNonrecurring Fair Value Measurements In addition to assets and liabilities that are recorded at fair value on a recurring basis, the Company's assets and liabilities are also subject to nonrecurring fair value measurements. Generally, assets are recorded at fair value on a nonrecurring basis as a result of impairment charges. Fiscal 2018 impairment charges to assets measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis were $1.4 billion and primarily related to restructuring activities described in  Note 14 , as well as discontinued real estate projects in the U.S. and decisions to exit certain international properties . These impairment charges were classified in operating, selling, general and administrative expenses in the Company's Consolidated Statement of Income. The fair value was determined based on comparable market values of similar properties or on a rental income approach, using Level 2 inputs. Impairment charges not related to restructuring or decisions to exit properties for fiscal 2018 were not material. Additionally, total impairment charges for fiscal  2017 were not material. Other Fair Value Disclosures The Company records cash and cash equivalents and short-term borrowings at cost. The carrying values of these instruments approximate their fair value due to their short-term maturities. The Company's long-term debt is also recorded at cost. The fair value is estimated using Level 2 inputs based on the Company's current incremental borrowing rate for similar types of borrowing arrangements. The carrying value and fair value of the Company's long-term debt as of January 31, 2018 and 2017 , are as follows: ##TABLE_START   January 31, 2018  January 31, 2017 (Amounts in millions)  Carrying Value  Fair Value  Carrying Value  Fair Value Long-term debt, including amounts due within one year  $ 33,783  $ 38,766  $ 38,271  $ 44,602 ##TABLE_ENDNote 8. Derivative Financial Instruments The Company uses derivative financial instruments for hedging and non-trading purposes to manage its exposure to changes in interest and currency exchange rates, as well as to maintain an appropriate mix of fixed- and variable-rate debt. Use of derivative financial instruments in hedging programs subjects the Company to certain risks, such as market and credit risks. Market risk represents the possibility that the value of the derivative financial instrument will change. In a hedging relationship, the change in the value of the derivative financial instrument is offset to a great extent by the change in the value of the underlying hedged item. Credit risk related to a derivative financial instrument represents the possibility that the counterparty will not fulfill the terms of the contract. The notional, or contractual, amount of the Company's derivative financial instruments is used to measure interest to be paid or received and does not represent the Company's exposure due to credit risk. Credit risk is monitored through established approval procedures, including setting concentration limits by counterparty, reviewing credit ratings and requiring collateral from the counterparty when appropriate. The Company only enters into derivative transactions with counterparties rated \"A-\" or better by nationally recognized credit rating agencies. Subsequent to entering into derivative transactions, the Company regularly monitors the credit ratings of its counterparties. In connection with various derivative agreements, including master netting arrangements, the Company held cash collateral from counterparties of $279 million and $242 million at January 31, 2018 and January 31, 2017 , respectively. The Company records cash collateral received as amounts due to the counterparties exclusive of any derivative asset. Furthermore, as part of the master netting arrangements with each of these counterparties, the Company is also required to post collateral with a counterparty if the Company's net derivative liability position exceeds $150 million with such counterparties. The Company did not have any cash collateral posted with counterparties at January 31, 2018 and January 31, 2017 , respectively. The Company records cash collateral it posts with counterparties as amounts receivable from those counterparties exclusive of any derivative liability. The Company uses derivative financial instruments for the purpose of hedging its exposure to interest and currency exchange rate risks and, accordingly, the contractual terms of a hedged instrument closely mirror those of the hedged item, providing a high degree of risk reduction and correlation. Contracts that are effective at meeting the risk reduction and correlation criteria are recorded using hedge accounting. If a derivative financial instrument is recorded using hedge accounting, depending on the nature of the hedge, changes in the fair value of the instrument will either be offset against the change in fair value of the hedged assets, liabilities or firm commitments through earnings or be recognized in accumulated other comprehensive loss until the hedged item is recognized in earnings. Any hedge ineffectiveness is immediately recognized in earnings. The Company's net investment and cash flow instruments are highly effective hedges and the ineffective portion has not been, and is not expected to be, significant. Instruments that do not meet the criteria for hedge accounting, or contracts for which the Company has not elected hedge accounting, are recorded at fair value with unrealized gains or losses reported in earnings during the period of the change. Fair Value Instruments The Company is a party to receive fixed-rate, pay variable-rate interest rate swaps that the Company uses to hedge the fair value of fixed-rate debt. The notional amounts are used to measure interest to be paid or received and do not represent the Company's exposure due to credit loss. The Company's interest rate swaps that receive fixed-interest rate payments and pay variable-interest rate payments are designated as fair value hedges. As the specific terms and notional amounts of the derivative instruments match those of the fixed-rate debt being hedged, the derivative instruments are assumed to be perfectly effective hedges. Changes in the fair values of these derivative instruments are recorded in earnings, but are offset by corresponding changes in the fair values of the hedged items, also recorded in earnings, and, accordingly, do not impact the Company's Consolidated Statements of Income. These fair value instruments will mature on dates ranging from October 2020 to April 2024 . Net Investment Instruments The Company is a party to cross-currency interest rate swaps that the Company uses to hedge its net investments. The agreements are contracts to exchange fixed-rate payments in one currency for fixed-rate payments in another currency. All changes in the fair value of these instruments are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss, offsetting the currency translation adjustment of the related investment that is also recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss. These instruments will mature on dates ranging from July 2020 to February 2030 . The Company has issued foreign-currency-denominated long-term debt as hedges of net investments of certain of its foreign operations. These foreign-currency-denominated long-term debt issuances are designated and qualify as nonderivative hedging instruments. Accordingly, the foreign currency translation of these debt instruments is recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss, offsetting the foreign currency translation adjustment of the related net investment that is also recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss. At January 31, 2018 and January 31, 2017 , the Company had 180 billion and 10 billion , respectively, of outstanding long-term debt designated as a hedge of its net investment in Japan, as well as outstanding long-term debt of 1.7 billion and 2.5 billion at January 31, 2018 and January 31, 2017 , respectively, that was designated as a hedge of its net investment in the United Kingdom. These nonderivative net investment hedges will mature on dates ranging from July 2020 to January 2039 . Cash Flow Instruments The Company is a party to receive fixed-rate, pay fixed-rate cross-currency interest rate swaps to hedge the currency exposure associated with the forecasted payments of principal and interest of certain non-U.S. denominated debt. The swaps are designated as cash flow hedges of the currency risk related to payments on the non-U.S. denominated debt. The effective portion of changes in the fair value of derivatives designated as cash flow hedges of foreign exchange risk is recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss and is subsequently reclassified into earnings in the period that the hedged forecasted transaction affects earnings. The hedged items are recognized foreign currency-denominated liabilities that are re-measured at spot exchange rates each period, and the assessment of effectiveness (and measurement of any ineffectiveness) is based on total changes in the related derivative's cash flows. As a result, the amount reclassified into earnings each period includes an amount that offsets the related transaction gain or loss arising from that re-measurement and the adjustment to earnings for the period's allocable portion of the initial spot-forward difference associated with the hedging instrument. These cash flow instruments will mature on dates ranging from April 2022 to March 2034 . Financial Statement Presentation Although subject to master netting arrangements, the Company does not offset derivative assets and derivative liabilities in its Consolidated Balance Sheets. Derivative instruments with an unrealized gain are recorded in the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets as either current or non-current assets, based on maturity date, and those hedging instruments with an unrealized loss are recorded as either current or non-current liabilities, based on maturity date. Refer to Note 7 for the net presentation of the Company's derivative instruments. The Company's derivative instruments, as well as its nonderivative debt instruments designated and qualifying as net investment hedges, were classified as follows as of January 31, 2018 and 2017 in the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets: ##TABLE_START  January 31, 2018  January 31, 2017 (Amounts in millions) Fair Value Instruments  Net Investment Instruments  Cash Flow Instruments  Fair Value Instruments  Net Investment Instruments  Cash Flow Instruments Derivative instruments            Derivative assets:            Other assets and deferred charges $   $  $  $  $  $              Derivative liabilities:            Deferred income taxes and other                    Nonderivative hedging instruments            Long-term debt   4,041      3,209   ##TABLE_ENDRealized gains and losses related to the Company's derivatives are recorded in interest, net, in the Company's Consolidated Statements of Income. Amounts related to the Company's derivatives expected to be reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive loss to net income during the next 12 months are not significant. Note 9. Taxes Income Before Income Taxes The components of income before income taxes are as follows: ##TABLE_START  Fiscal Years Ended January 31, (Amounts in millions)   U.S. $ 10,722  $ 15,680  $ 16,685 Non-U.S. 4,401  4,817  4,953 Total income before income taxes $ 15,123  $ 20,497  $ 21,638 ##TABLE_ENDA summary of the provision for income taxes is as follows: ##TABLE_START  Fiscal Years Ended January 31, (Amounts in millions)   Current:      U.S. federal $ 2,998  $ 3,454  $ 5,562 U.S. state and local   International 1,377  1,510  1,400 Total current tax provision 4,780  5,459  7,584 Deferred:      U.S. federal (22 )  1,054  (704 ) U.S. state and local (12 )   (106 ) International (146 )  (360 )  (216 ) Total deferred tax expense (benefit) (180 )   (1,026 ) Total provision for income taxes $ 4,600  $ 6,204  $ 6,558 ##TABLE_ENDOn December 22, 2017, the Tax Act was enacted and contains significant changes to U.S. income tax law. Effective in 2018, the Tax Act reduces the U.S. statutory tax rate from 35% to 21% and creates new taxes focused on foreign-sourced earnings and related-party payments, including the creation of the base erosion anti-abuse tax and a new tax on global intangible low-taxed income (\"GILTI\"). By operation of law, the Company will apply a blended U.S. statutory federal income tax rate of 33.8% for fiscal 2018. In addition, the Company was subject to a one-time transition tax in fiscal 2018 on accumulated foreign subsidiary earnings not previously subject to U.S. income tax. The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) staff issued SAB 118 on December 22, 2017, which allows companies to record provisional amounts during a measurement period not to extend beyond one year of the enactment date. Due to the timing of the enactment and the complexity involved in applying the provisions of the Tax Act, the Company made reasonable estimates of the effects and recorded provisional amounts in its financial statements as of January 31, 2018, in accordance with SAB 118. As the Company collects and prepares necessary data, and interprets the Tax Act and any additional guidance issued by the U.S. Treasury Department, the IRS, and other standard-setting bodies, the Company may make adjustments to the provisional amounts during fiscal 2019. Those adjustments may materially impact the Company's provision for income taxes and effective tax rate in the period in which the adjustments are made. The accounting for the tax effects of the Tax Act will be completed by the measurement period provided in SAB 118. Provisional amounts for the following income tax effects of the Tax Act have been recorded as of January 31, 2018, and are subject to change during fiscal 2019. The net tax benefit recognized in fiscal 2018 related to the Tax Act was $0.2 billion . As the Company completes its analysis of the Tax Act and incorporates additional guidance that may be issued by the U.S. Treasury Department, the IRS or other standard-setting bodies, the Company may identify additional effects not reflected as of January 31, 2018. One-time Transition Tax The Tax Act requires the Company to pay U.S. income taxes on accumulated foreign subsidiary earnings not previously subject to U.S. income tax at a rate of 15.5% to the extent of foreign cash and certain other net current assets, as defined by the Tax Act, and 8.0% on the remaining earnings. The Company recorded a provisional amount of $1.9 billion of additional income tax expense for its one-time transitional tax liability. The Company recorded a provisional amount based on estimates as it completes its analysis of the application of the effects of the Tax Act as well as finalize its calculations surrounding the components of its foreign subsidiaries subject to the transition tax including the potential of any correlative adjustments. Deferred Tax Effects The Tax Act reduces the U.S. statutory tax rate from 35% to 21% for years after 2017. Accordingly, the Company re-measured its deferred taxes as of January 31, 2018, to reflect the reduced rate that will apply in future periods when these deferred taxes are settled or realized. The Company recognized a deferred tax benefit of $2.1 billion to reflect the reduced U.S. tax rate and other effects of the Tax Act. The benefit associated with the remeasurement of the deferred taxes is provisional as of January 31, 2018, as the Company continues gathering the necessary information to complete the calculations. The Company has no provisional adjustment with respect to the GILTI provision of the Tax Act as the Company is not able to make reasonable estimates of its related effects at this time. The Company has not yet elected an accounting policy to determine whether it will recognize GILTI as a period cost when incurred or to recognize deferred taxes for basis differences expected to reverse. Effective Income Tax Rate Reconciliation The Company's effective income tax rate is typically lower than the U.S. statutory tax rate primarily because of benefits from lower-taxed global operations, including the use of global funding structures and certain U.S. tax credits as further discussed in the \"Cash and Cash Equivalents\" section of the Company's significant accounting policies in Note 1 . The Company's non-U.S. income is generally subject to local country tax rates that are below the U.S. statutory tax rate. Certain non-U.S. earnings have been indefinitely reinvested outside the U.S. A reconciliation of the significant differences between the U.S. statutory tax rate and the effective income tax rate on pretax income from continuing operations is as follows: ##TABLE_START  Fiscal Years Ended January 31,    U.S. statutory tax rate 33.8 %  35.0 %  35.0 % U.S. state income taxes, net of federal income tax benefit 1.8 %  1.7 %  1.8 % Impact of the Tax Act:      One-time transition tax 12.3 %   %   % Deferred tax effects (14.1 )%   %   % Income taxed outside the U.S. (4.1 )%  (4.5 )%  (4.0 )% Net impact of repatriated international earnings (0.1 )%  (1.0 )%  0.1 % Other, net 0.8 %  (0.9 )%  (2.6 )% Effective income tax rate 30.4 %  30.3 %  30.3 % ##TABLE_ENDDeferred Taxes The Company recorded a provisional adjustment to its U.S. deferred income taxes as of January 31, 2018 to reflect the reduction in the U.S. statutory tax rate from 35% to 21% resulting from the Tax Act. The significant components of the Company's deferred tax account balances are as follows: ##TABLE_START   January 31, (Amounts in millions)   Deferred tax assets:     Loss and tax credit carryforwards  $ 1,989  $ 3,633 Accrued liabilities  2,482  3,437 Share-based compensation   Other  1,251  1,474 Total deferred tax assets  5,939  8,853 Valuation allowances  (1,843 )  (1,494 ) Deferred tax assets, net of valuation allowance  4,096  7,359 Deferred tax liabilities:     Property and equipment  3,954  6,435 Inventories  1,153  1,808 Other   1,884 Total deferred tax liabilities  6,048  10,127 Net deferred tax liabilities  $ 1,952  $ 2,768 ##TABLE_ENDThe deferred taxes noted above are classified as follows in the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets: ##TABLE_START   January 31, (Amounts in millions)   Balance Sheet classification     Assets:     Other assets and deferred charges  $ 1,879  $ 1,565      Liabilities:     Deferred income taxes and other  3,831  4,333      Net deferred tax liabilities  $ 1,952  $ 2,768 ##TABLE_ENDUnremitted Earnings The Company has previously asserted all of its unremitted earnings offshore were permanently reinvested. Accordingly, the Company did not record any deferred taxes related to any outside basis differences associated with its foreign subsidiaries. As part of the tax reform enacted on December 22, 2017, the Company is currently assessing the impact of the new legislation, which can in turn, impact its assertion regarding any potential future repatriation. After consideration of the provisional transition tax calculation and deemed repatriation of the previously unremitted earnings, the Company is estimating, on a provisional basis, its outside tax basis exceeds the outside book basis of its foreign subsidiaries by approximately $10.0 billion . Once the calculations are completed regarding the transition tax, taking into account the timeline provided in SAB 118, the Company will provide updated disclosures regarding any potential changes for its previous assertions. Net Operating Losses, Tax Credit Carryforwards and Valuation Allowances At January 31, 2018 , the Company had net operating loss and capital loss carryforwards totaling approximately $6.7 billion . Of these carryforwards, approximately $3.6 billion will expire, if not utilized, in various years through 2038 . The remaining carryforwards have no expiration. At January 31, 2018 , the Company's provisional transition tax calculation fully utilized all foreign tax credit carryforwards. The recoverability of these future tax deductions and credits is evaluated by assessing the adequacy of future expected taxable income from all sources, including taxable income in prior carryback years, reversal of taxable temporary differences, forecasted operating earnings and available tax planning strategies. To the extent the Company does not consider it more likely than not that a deferred tax asset will be recovered, a valuation allowance is established. To the extent that a valuation allowance has been established and it is subsequently determined that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will be recovered, the valuation allowance will be released. The Company had valuation allowances of approximately $1.8 billion and $1.5 billion as of January 31, 2018 and 2017 , respectively, on deferred tax assets associated primarily with net operating loss carryforwards for which management has determined it is more likely than not that the deferred tax asset will not be realized. Net activity in the valuation allowance during fiscal 2018 related to releases arising from the use of deferred tax assets, changes in judgment regarding the future realization of deferred tax assets, increases from certain net operating losses and deductible temporary differences arising in fiscal 2018 , decreases due to operating loss expirations and fluctuations in currency exchange rates. Management believes that it is more likely than not that the remaining deferred tax assets will be fully realized. Uncertain Tax Positions The benefits of uncertain tax positions are recorded in the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements only after determining a more-likely-than-not probability that the uncertain tax positions will withstand challenge, if any, from taxing authorities. As of January 31, 2018 and 2017 , the amount of unrecognized tax benefits related to continuing operations was $1.0 billion and $1.1 billion , respectively. The amount of unrecognized tax benefits that would affect the Company's effective income tax rate was $690 million and $703 million as of January 31, 2018 and 2017 , respectively. A reconciliation of unrecognized tax benefits from continuing operations is as follows: ##TABLE_START  Fiscal Years Ended January 31, (Amounts in millions)   Unrecognized tax benefits, beginning of year $ 1,050  $  $ Increases related to prior year tax positions   Decreases related to prior year tax positions (254 )  (32 )  (446 ) Increases related to current year tax positions   Settlements during the period (23 )  (46 )  (25 ) Lapse in statutes of limitations (15 )  (12 )  (43 ) Unrecognized tax benefits, end of year $ 1,010  $ 1,050  $ ##TABLE_ENDThe Company classifies interest and penalties related to uncertain tax benefits as interest expense and as operating, selling, general and administrative expenses, respectively. During fiscal 2018 , 2017 and 2016 , the Company recognized interest expense related to uncertain tax positions of $32 million , $35 million and $5 million , respectively. As of January 31, 2018 and 2017 , accrued interest related to uncertain tax positions of $96 million and $72 million , respectively, was recorded in the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets. As of January 31, 2018, accrued penalties related to uncertain tax positions of $12 million were recorded in the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets. As of January 31, 2017, there were no accrued penalties related to uncertain tax positions recorded in the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets. During the next twelve months, it is reasonably possible that tax audit resolutions could reduce unrecognized tax benefits by between $50 million and $400 million , either because the tax positions are sustained on audit or because the Company agrees to their disallowance. The Company is focused on resolving tax audits as expeditiously as possible. As a result of these efforts, unrecognized tax benefits could potentially be reduced beyond the provided range during the next twelve months. The Company does not expect any change to have a material impact to its Consolidated Financial Statements. The Company remains subject to income tax examinations for its U.S. federal income taxes generally for fiscal 2013 through 2018 . The Company also remains subject to income tax examinations for international income taxes for fiscal 2011 through 2018 , and for U.S. state and local income taxes generally for the fiscal years ended 2013 through 2018 . Other Taxes The Company is subject to tax examinations for value added, sales-based, payroll and other non-income taxes. A number of these examinations are ongoing in various jurisdictions. In certain cases, the Company has received assessments from the respective taxing authorities in connection with these examinations. Unless otherwise indicated, the possible losses or range of possible losses associated with these matters are individually immaterial, but a group of related matters, if decided adversely to the Company, could result in a liability material to the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements. In particular, Brazil federal, state and local laws are complex and subject to varying interpretations, and the Company's subsidiaries in Brazil are party to a large number of non-income tax assessments. One of these interpretations common to the retail industry in Brazil relates to whether credits received from suppliers should be treated as a reduction of cost for purposes of calculating certain indirect taxes. The Company believes credits received from suppliers are reductions in cost and that it has substantial legal defenses in this matter and intends to defend this matter vigorously. As such, the Company has not accrued for this matter, although the Company may be required to deposit funds in escrow or secure financial guarantees to continue the judicial process in defending this matter in Brazil. Note 10. Contingencies Legal Proceedings The Company is involved in a number of legal proceedings. The Company has made accruals with respect to these matters, where appropriate, which are reflected in the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements. For some matters, a liability is not probable or the amount cannot be reasonably estimated and therefore an accrual has not been made. However, where a liability is reasonably possible and may be material, such matters have been disclosed. The Company may enter into discussions regarding settlement of these matters, and may enter into settlement agreements, if it believes settlement is in the best interest of the Company and its shareholders. Unless stated otherwise, the matters discussed below, if decided adversely to or settled by the Company, individually or in the aggregate, may result in a liability material to the Company's financial condition or results of operations. ASDA Equal Value Claims ASDA Stores, Ltd. (\"ASDA\"), a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, is a defendant in over 10,000 \"equal value\" claims that are proceeding before an Employment Tribunal in Manchester (the \"Employment Tribunal\") in the United Kingdom (\"UK\") on behalf of current and former ASDA store employees, and further claims may be asserted in the future. The claimants allege that the work performed by female employees in ASDA's retail stores is of equal value in terms of, among other things, the demands of their jobs compared to that of male employees working in ASDA's warehouse and distribution facilities, and that the disparity in pay between these different job positions is not objectively justified. As a result, claimants are requesting differential back pay based on higher wage rates in the warehouse and distribution facilities and higher wage rates on a prospective basis. On March 23, 2015, ASDA asked the Employment Tribunal to stay all proceedings and to \"strike out\" substantially all of the claims because the claimants had not adhered to the Tribunal's procedural rule for including multiple claimants on the same claim form. On July 23, 2015, the Employment Tribunal denied ASDA's requests. Following additional proceedings, on June 20, 2017, the Employment Appeal Tribunal ruled in favor of ASDA on the \"strike out\" issue and remitted the matter to the Employment Tribunal to determine whether the improperly filed claims should be struck out. On July 12, 2017, claimants sought permission from the Court of Appeals to appeal this ruling, which was granted on October 3, 2017. A hearing before the Court of Appeals is scheduled for October 23, 2018. As to the initial phase of the Equal Value claims, on October 14, 2016, following a preliminary hearing, the Employment Tribunal ruled that claimants could compare their positions in ASDA's retail stores with those of employees in ASDA's warehouse and distribution facilities. On August 31, 2017, the Employment Appeal Tribunal affirmed the Employment Tribunal's ruling. The Employment Appeal Tribunal also granted permission for ASDA to appeal substantially all of its findings on August 31, 2017. ASDA sought permission to appeal the remainder of the Employment Appeal Tribunal's findings to the Court of Appeals on September 21, 2017. A hearing before the Court of Appeals is scheduled for October 10, 2018. Claimants are now proceeding in the next phase of their claims. That phase will determine whether the work performed by the claimants is of equal value to the work performed by employees in ASDA's warehouse and distribution facilities. At present, the Company cannot predict the number of such claims that may be filed, and cannot reasonably estimate any loss or range of loss that may arise from these proceedings. The Company believes it has substantial factual and legal defenses to these claims, and intends to defend the claims vigorously. National Prescription Opiate Litigation In December 2017, the United States Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation ordered consolidated numerous lawsuits filed against a wide array of defendants by various plaintiffs, including counties, cities, healthcare providers, Native American tribes, individuals, and third-party payors, asserting claims generally concerning the impacts of widespread opioid abuse. The consolidated multidistrict litigation is entitled In re National Prescription Opiate Litigation (MDL No. 2804) , and is pending in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Ohio. The Company is named as a defendant in some of the cases included in this multidistrict litigation, including cases filed by several counties in West Virginia; by healthcare providers in Mississippi, Alabama, Texas, and Florida; and by the St. Croix Chippewa Indians of Wisconsin. Similar cases that name the Company have been filed in state courts by various counties and municipalities; by health care providers; and by various Native American Tribes. The Company cannot predict the number of such claims that may be filed, and cannot reasonably estimate any loss or range of loss that may arise from such claims. The Company believes it has substantial factual and legal defenses to these claims, and intends to defend the claims vigorously. FCPA Investigation and Related Matters The Audit Committee (the \"Audit Committee\") of the Board of Directors of the Company has been conducting an internal investigation into, among other things, alleged violations of the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (\"FCPA\") and other alleged crimes or misconduct in connection with foreign subsidiaries, including Wal-Mart de Mxico, S.A.B. de C.V. (\"Walmex\"), and whether prior allegations of such violations and/or misconduct were appropriately handled by the Company. The Audit Committee and the Company have engaged outside counsel from a number of law firms and other advisors who are assisting in the on-going investigation of these matters. The Company has also been conducting a voluntary global review of its policies, practices and internal controls for anti-corruption compliance. The Company is engaged in strengthening its global anti-corruption compliance program through appropriate remedial anti-corruption measures. In November 2011, the Company voluntarily disclosed that investigative activity to the U.S. Department of Justice (the \"DOJ\") and the Securities and Exchange Commission (the \"SEC\"). Since the implementation of the global review and the enhanced anti-corruption compliance program, the Audit Committee and the Company have identified or been made aware of additional allegations regarding potential violations of the FCPA. When such allegations have been reported or identified, the Audit Committee and the Company, together with their third party advisors, have conducted inquiries and when warranted based on those inquiries, opened investigations. Inquiries or investigations regarding allegations of potential FCPA violations were commenced in a number of foreign markets where the Company operates, including, but not limited to, Brazil, China and India. As previously disclosed, the Company is under investigation by the DOJ and the SEC regarding possible violations of the FCPA. The Company has been cooperating with the agencies and discussions have been ongoing regarding the resolution of these matters. These discussions have progressed to a point that the Company can now reasonably estimate a probable loss and has recorded an aggregate accrual of $283 million with respect to these matters (the \"Accrual\"). As the discussions are continuing, there can be no assurance as to the timing or the terms of the final resolution of these matters. A number of federal and local government agencies in Mexico have also initiated investigations of these matters. Walmex is cooperating with the Mexican governmental agencies conducting these investigations. Furthermore, lawsuits relating to the matters under investigation have been filed by several of the Company's shareholders against it, certain of its current directors, and certain of its former directors, certain of its former officers and certain of Walmex's former officers. The Company could be exposed to a variety of negative consequences as a result of the matters noted above. There could be one or more enforcement actions in respect of the matters that are the subject of some or all of the on-going government investigations, and such actions, if brought, may result in judgments, settlements, fines, penalties, injunctions, cease and desist orders, debarment or other relief, criminal convictions and/or penalties and the shareholder lawsuits referenced above may result in judgments against the Company and its current and former directors and officers named in those proceedings. The Company expects that there will be on-going media and governmental interest, including additional news articles from media publications on these matters, which could impact the perception among certain audiences of the Company's role as a corporate citizen. In addition, the Company has incurred and expects to continue to incur costs in responding to requests for information or subpoenas seeking documents, testimony and other information in connection with the government investigations, in defending the shareholder lawsuits, and in conducting the review and investigations. These costs will be expensed as incurred. For the fiscal years ended January 31, 2018 , 2017 and 2016 , the Company incurred the following third-party expenses in connection with the FCPA investigation and related matters: ##TABLE_START   Fiscal Years Ended January 31, (Amounts in millions)    Ongoing inquiries and investigations  $  $  $ Global compliance program and organizational enhancements    Total  $  $  $ ##TABLE_ENDThe Company does not presently believe that these matters, including the Accrual (and the payment of the Accrual at some point-in-time in the future), will have a material adverse effect on its business, although given the inherent uncertainties in such situations, the Company can provide no assurance that these matters will not be material to its business in the future. Note 11. Commitments The Company has long-term leases for stores and equipment. Rentals (including amounts applicable to taxes, insurance, maintenance, other operating expenses and contingent rentals) under operating leases and other short-term rental arrangements were $2.9 billion , $2.6 billion and $2.5 billion in fiscal 2018 , 2017 and 2016 , respectively. Aggregate minimum annual rentals at January 31, 2018 , under non-cancelable leases are as follows: ##TABLE_START (Amounts in millions)     Fiscal Year  Operating Leases (1)  Capital Lease and Financing Obligations  $ 1,933  $ 1,039  1,718  2021  1,532  2022  1,381  2023  1,158  Thereafter  7,644  5,423 Total minimum rentals  $ 15,366  $ 9,930 Less estimated executory costs    Net minimum lease payments    9,903 Noncash gain on future termination of financing obligation    1,111 Less imputed interest    (3,567 ) Present value of minimum lease payments    $ 7,447 ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (1) Represents minimum contractual obligation for non-cancelable leases with initial or remaining terms greater than 12 months as of January 31, 2018 . ##TABLE_END Certain of the Company's leases provide for the payment of contingent rentals based on a percentage of sales. Such contingent rentals were not material for fiscal 2018 , 2017 and 2016 . Substantially all of the Company's store leases have renewal options, some of which may trigger an escalation in rentals. Note 12. Retirement-Related Benefits The Company offers a 401(k) plan for associates in the U.S. under which eligible associates can begin contributing to the plan immediately upon hire. The Company also offers a 401(k) type plan for associates in Puerto Rico under which associates can begin to contribute generally after one year of employment. Under these plans, after one year of employment, the Company matches 100% of participant contributions up to 6% of annual eligible earnings. The matching contributions immediately vest at 100% for each associate. Participants can contribute up to 50% of their pretax earnings, but not more than the statutory limits. Associates in international countries who are not U.S. citizens are covered by various defined contribution post-employment benefit arrangements. These plans are administered based upon the legislative and tax requirements in the countries in which they are established. The following table summarizes the contribution expense related to the Company's defined contribution plans for fiscal 2018 , 2017 and 2016 : ##TABLE_START  Fiscal Years Ended January 31, (Amounts in millions)   Defined contribution plans:      U.S. $ 1,124  $ 1,064  $ International   Total contribution expense for defined contribution plans $ 1,250  $ 1,237  $ 1,146 ##TABLE_ENDAdditionally, the Company's subsidiaries in the United Kingdom and Japan have sponsored defined benefit pension plans. The plan in the United Kingdom was overfunded by $97 million at January 31, 2018 and underfunded by $129 million at January 31, 2017 . The plan in Japan was underfunded by $184 million and $203 million at January 31, 2018 and 2017 , respectively. Overfunded amounts are recorded as assets in the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets in other assets and deferred charges. Underfunded amounts are recorded as liabilities in the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets in deferred income taxes and other. Certain other international operations also have defined benefit arrangements that are not significant. Note 13. Acquisitions, Disposals and Related Items Other than the jet.com transaction discussed below, the Company completed certain eCommerce acquisitions during fiscal 2018 and 2017 , which were immaterial, individually and in the aggregate, to the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements. The following significant transaction primarily impacts the operations of the Company's Walmart U.S. segment: Jet.com, Inc. In September 2016, the Company completed the acquisition of jet.com, a U.S.-based eCommerce company. The integration of jet.com into the Walmart U.S. segment is building upon the current eCommerce foundation, allowing for synergies from talent, logistical operations and access to a broader customer base. The total purchase price for the acquisition was $2.4 billion , net of cash acquired. The allocation of the purchase price includes $1.7 billion in goodwill and $0.6 billion in intangible assets. As part of the transaction, the Company agreed to pay additional compensation of approximately $0.8 billion over a five year period. The following significant transactions impact the operations of the Company's Walmart International segment: Suburbia In April 2017, one of the Company's subsidiaries sold Suburbia, the apparel retail division in Mexico, for $1.0 billion . As part of the sales agreement, the Company is also leasing certain real estate to the purchaser. The sale resulted in a pre-tax gain of $0.7 billion , of which $0.4 billion was recognized in the second quarter of fiscal 2018 in membership and other income, and the remainder was deferred and is being recognized over the lease terms of approximately 20 years . Yihaodian and JD.com, Inc. (\"JD\") In June 2016, the Company sold certain assets relating to Yihaodian, its eCommerce operations in China, including the Yihaodian brand, website and application, to JD in exchange for Class A ordinary shares of JD representing approximately five percent of JD's outstanding ordinary shares on a fully diluted basis. The $1.5 billion investment in JD is carried at cost and is included in other assets and deferred charges in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets. The sale resulted in the recognition of a $535 million noncash gain, which was included in membership and other income in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Income. Subsequently, during fiscal 2017, the Company purchased $1.9 billion of additional JD shares classified as available for sale securities, representing an incremental ownership percentage of approximately five percent , for a total ownership of approximately ten percent of JD's outstanding ordinary shares. In fiscal 2016, the Company completed the purchase of all of the remaining noncontrolling interest in Yihaodian for approximately $760 million , using existing cash to complete this transaction. Note 14. Restructuring Charges In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018, the Company announced several organizational changes to position the business for more efficient growth going forward. As a result, the Company recorded $1.2 billion in pre-tax restructuring charges in fiscal 2018 as follows: ##TABLE_START   Fiscal Year Ended January 31, 2018 (Amounts in millions)  Asset Impairment  Severance Costs  Total Walmart International  $  $  $ Sam's Club    Corporate and support     Total  $  $  $ 1,201 ##TABLE_ENDThe asset impairment charges primarily relate to the real estate of the Sam's Club closures and the wind-down of the Brazil first-party eCommerce business, which were written down to their estimated fair value. Refer to Note 7 for information on fair value measurement. The pre-tax restructuring charges of $1.2 billion are classified in operating, selling, general and administrative expenses in the Company's Consolidated Statement of Income for fiscal 2018. At January 31, 2018, substantially all of the severances costs were recorded in accrued liabilities in the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheet. Almost all of these severance costs are expected to be paid during the first quarter of fiscal 2019. Note 15. Segments The Company is engaged in the operation of retail, wholesale and other units, as well as eCommerce websites, located throughout the U.S., Africa, Argentina, Brazil, Canada, Central America, Chile, China, India, Japan, Mexico and the United Kingdom. The Company's operations are conducted in three reportable segments: Walmart U.S., Walmart International and Sam's Club. The Company defines its segments as those operations whose results the chief operating decision maker (\"CODM\") regularly reviews to analyze performance and allocate resources. The Company sells similar individual products and services in each of its segments. It is impractical to segregate and identify revenues for each of these individual products and services. The Walmart U.S. segment includes the Company's mass merchant concept in the U.S. operating under the \"Walmart\" or \"Wal-Mart\" brands, as well as eCommerce. The Walmart International segment consists of the Company's operations outside of the U.S., including eCommerce. The Sam's Club segment includes the warehouse membership clubs in the U.S., as well as samsclub.com. Corporate and support consists of corporate overhead and other items not allocated to any of the Company's segments. The Company measures the results of its segments using, among other measures, each segment's net sales and operating income, which includes certain corporate overhead allocations. From time to time, the Company revises the measurement of each segment's operating income, including any corporate overhead allocations, as determined by the information regularly reviewed by its CODM. When the measurement of a segment changes, previous period amounts and balances are reclassified to be comparable to the current period's presentation. Information for the Company's segments, as well as for Corporate and support, including the reconciliation to income before income taxes, is provided in the following table: ##TABLE_START (Amounts in millions)  Walmart U.S.  Walmart International  Sam's Club  Corporate and support  Consolidated Fiscal Year Ended January 31, 2018           Net sales  $ 318,477  $ 118,068  $ 59,216  $   $ 495,761 Operating income (loss)  17,869  5,352   (3,766 )  20,437 Interest, net          (2,178 ) Loss on extinguishment of debt          (3,136 ) Income before income taxes          $ 15,123 Total assets  $ 104,347  $ 81,549  $ 13,418  $ 5,208  $ 204,522 Depreciation and amortization  3,655  2,601   3,807  10,529 Capital expenditures  5,680  2,607   1,138  10,051            Fiscal Year Ended January 31, 2017           Net sales  $ 307,833  $ 116,119  $ 57,365  $   $ 481,317 Operating income (loss)  17,745  5,758  1,671  (2,410 )  22,764 Interest, net          (2,267 ) Income before income taxes          $ 20,497 Total assets  $ 104,262  $ 74,508  $ 14,125  $ 5,930  $ 198,825 Depreciation and amortization  3,298  2,629   3,666  10,080 Capital expenditures  6,090  2,697   1,193  10,619            Fiscal Year Ended January 31, 2016           Net sales  $ 298,378  $ 123,408  $ 56,828  $   $ 478,614 Operating income (loss)  19,087  5,346  1,820  (2,148 )  24,105 Interest, net          (2,467 ) Income before income taxes          $ 21,638 Total assets  $ 103,109  $ 73,720  $ 13,998  $ 8,754  $ 199,581 Depreciation and amortization  2,800  2,549   3,633  9,454 Capital expenditures  6,728  2,930   1,124  11,477 ##TABLE_ENDTotal revenues, consisting of net sales and membership and other income, and long-lived assets, consisting primarily of property and equipment, net, aggregated by the Company's U.S. and non-U.S. operations for fiscal 2018 , 2017 and 2016 , are as follows: ##TABLE_START  Fiscal Years Ended January 31, (Amounts in millions)   Revenues      U.S. operations $ 380,580  $ 367,784  $ 357,559 Non-U.S. operations 119,763  118,089  124,571 Total revenues $ 500,343  $ 485,873  $ 482,130       Long-lived assets      U.S. operations $ 81,478  $ 82,746  $ 82,475 Non-U.S. operations 33,340  31,432  34,041 Total long-lived assets $ 114,818  $ 114,178  $ 116,516 ##TABLE_ENDNo individual country outside of the U.S. had total revenues or long-lived assets that were material to the consolidated totals.

CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES ##TABLE_ENDEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures We maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to provide reasonable assurance that information, which is required to be timely disclosed, is accumulated and communicated to management in a timely fashion. In designing and evaluating such controls and procedures, we recognize that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. Our management is necessarily required to use judgment in evaluating controls and procedures. Also, we have investments in unconsolidated entities. Since we do not control or manage those entities, our controls and procedures with respect to those entities are substantially more limited than those we maintain with respect to our consolidated subsidiaries. In the ordinary course of business, we review our internal control over financial reporting and make changes to our systems and processes to improve such controls and increase efficiency, while ensuring that we maintain an effective internal control environment. Changes may include such activities as implementing new, more efficient systems, updating existing systems, automating manual processes, migrating certain processes to our shared services organizations and increasing monitoring controls. These changes have not materially affected, and are not reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company's internal control over financial reporting. However, they allow us to continue to enhance our internal control over financial reporting and ensure that our internal control environment remains effective. An evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report was performed under the supervision and with the participation of management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer. Based upon that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are effective to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files or submits under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, is accumulated and communicated to management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure and are effective to provide reasonable assurance that such information is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified by the SEC's rules and forms. Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting Management has responsibility for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external reporting purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Management has assessed the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of January 31, 2018 . In making its assessment, management has utilized the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations (\"COSO\") of the Treadway Commission in Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013). Management concluded that based on its assessment, Walmart's internal control over financial reporting was effective as of January 31, 2018 . The Company's internal control over financial reporting as of January 31, 2018 , has been audited by Ernst  Young LLP as stated in their report which appears herein. Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting There has been no change in the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of January 31, 2018 , that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company's internal control over financial reporting. Report on Ethical Standards Our Company was founded on the belief that open communication and the highest ethical standards are necessary to be successful. Our long-standing \"Open Door\" communication policy helps management be aware of and address issues in a timely and effective manner. Through the open door policy all associates are encouraged to inform management at the appropriate level when they are concerned about any matter pertaining to Walmart. Walmart has adopted a Statement of Ethics to guide our associates in the continued observance of high ethical standards such as honesty, integrity and compliance with the law in the conduct of Walmart's business. Familiarity and compliance with the Statement of Ethics is required of all associates. The Company also maintains a separate Code of Ethics for our senior financial officers. Walmart also has in place a Related-Party Transaction Policy. This policy applies to Walmart's senior officers and directors and requires material related-party transactions to be reviewed by the Audit Committee. The senior officers and directors are required to report material related-party transactions to Walmart.

BUSINESS ##TABLE_ENDGeneral Walmart Inc. (\"Walmart,\" the \"Company\" or \"we\") helps people around the world save money and live better  anytime and anywhere  by providing the opportunity to shop in retail stores and through eCommerce. Through innovation, we strive to continuously improve a customer-centric experience that seamlessly integrates our eCommerce and retail stores in an omni-channel offering that saves time for our customers. Each week, we serve nearly 275 million customers who visit our more than 11,300 stores and numerous eCommerce websites under 58 banners in 27 countries. Our strategy is to make every day easier for busy families, operate with discipline, sharpen our culture and become digital, and make trust a competitive advantage. Making life easier for busy families includes our commitment to price leadership, which has been and will remain a cornerstone of our business, as well as increasing convenience to save our customers time. By leading on price, we earn the trust of our customers every day by providing a broad assortment of quality merchandise and services at everyday low prices (\"EDLP\"). EDLP is our pricing philosophy under which we price items at a low price every day so our customers trust that our prices will not change under frequent promotional activity. Everyday low cost (\"EDLC\") is our commitment to control expenses so our cost savings can be passed along to our customers. Our operations comprise three reportable segments: Walmart U.S., Walmart International and Sam's Club. Our fiscal year ends on January 31 for our United States (\"U.S.\") and Canadian operations. We consolidate all other operations generally using a one-month lag and on a calendar year basis. Our discussion is as of and for the fiscal years ended January 31, 2019 (\"fiscal 2019 \"), January 31, 2018 (\"fiscal 2018 \") and January 31, 2017 (\"fiscal 2017 \"). During fiscal 2019 , we generated total revenues of $514.4 billion , which was primarily comprised of net sales of $510.3 billion . We maintain our principal offices at 702 S.W. 8th Street, Bentonville, Arkansas 72716, USA. Our common stock trades on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol \"WMT.\" The Development of Our Company Although Walmart was incorporated in Delaware in October 1969, the businesses conducted by our founders began in 1945 when Sam M. Walton opened a franchise Ben Franklin variety store in Newport, Arkansas. In 1946, his brother, James L. Walton, opened a similar store in Versailles, Missouri. Until 1962, our founders' business was devoted entirely to the operation of variety stores. In that year, the first Wal-Mart Discount City, which was a discount store, opened in Rogers, Arkansas. In 1983, we opened our first Sam's Club, and in 1988, we opened our first supercenter. In 1998, we opened our first Walmart Neighborhood Market. In 1991, we began our first international initiative when we entered into a joint venture in Mexico. Since then, our international presence has expanded and, as of January 31, 2019 , our Walmart International segment conducted business in 26 countries. In 2000, we began our first eCommerce initiative by creating walmart.com. That same year, we also created samsclub.com. Since then, our eCommerce presence has continued to grow. In 2007, leveraging our physical stores, walmart.com launched its Site to Store service, enabling customers to make a purchase online and pick up merchandise in stores. In 2016, we acquired jet.com in the U.S. and formed a strategic alliance with JD.com in China. Since the jet.com purchase, we have continued to expand our U.S. eCommerce capabilities through acquisitions including Shoes.com, Moosejaw, Bonobos and other digital consumer brands. In 2017, walmart.com launched free two-day shipping on more than 2 million items and we created Store N o 8, a technology incubator with a focus to drive commerce forward. In fiscal 2019, we acquired a majority stake of Flipkart Private Limited (\"Flipkart\"), an Indian-based eCommerce marketplace , with an ecosystem that includes eCommerce platforms of Flipkart, Myntra and Jabong. In the U.S., we added more grocery pickup and delivery locations and as of January 31, 2019, we offered grocery pickup at more than 2,100 locations and grocery delivery at nearly 800 locations. Our eCommerce efforts and innovation have led to omni-channel offerings in many of our markets. We are building an ecosystem with our omni-channel capabilities, stores, services, eCommerce sites, supply chain and more than 2.2 million associates to better serve our customers. Information About Our Segments We are engaged in global operations of retail, wholesale and other units, as well as eCommerce, located throughout the U.S., Africa, Argentina, Canada, Central America, Chile, China, India, Japan, Mexico and the United Kingdom, as well as Brazil prior to the sale of the majority stake of Walmart Brazil discussed in Note 13 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. Our operations are conducted in three reportable segments: Walmart U.S., Walmart International and Sam's Club. We define our segments as those operations whose results the chief operating decision maker (\"CODM\") regularly reviews to analyze performance and allocate resources. Each of our segments contributes to the Company's operating results differently. Each, however, has generally maintained a consistent contribution rate to the Company's net sales and operating income in recent years other than minor changes to the contribution rate for the Walmart International segment due to fluctuations in currency exchange rates. We sell similar individual products and services in each of our segments. It is impractical to segregate and identify revenues for each of these individual products and services. We measure the results of our segments using, among other measures, each segment's net sales and operating income, which includes certain corporate overhead allocations. From time to time, we revise the measurement of each segment's operating income, including any corporate overhead allocations, as determined by the information regularly reviewed by our CODM. When the measurement of a segment changes, previous period amounts and balances are reclassified to be comparable to the current period's presentation. In fiscal 2019, we revised certain of our corporate overhead allocations to the operating segments and, accordingly, revised prior period amounts for comparability. Walmart U.S. Segment Walmart U.S. is our largest segment and operates in the U.S., including in all 50 states, Washington D.C. and Puerto Rico. Walmart U.S. is a mass merchandiser of consumer products, operating under the \"Walmart\" and \"Walmart Neighborhood Market\" brands, as well as walmart.com, jet.com and other eCommerce brands. Walmart U.S. had net sales of $331.7 billion for fiscal 2019 , representing 65% of our fiscal 2019 consolidated net sales, and had net sales of $318.5 billion and $307.8 billion for fiscal 2018 and 2017 , respectively. Of our three segments, Walmart U.S. has historically had the highest gross profit as a percentage of net sales (\"gross profit rate\"). In addition, Walmart U.S. has historically contributed the greatest amount to the Company's net sales and operating income. Omni-channel. Walmart U.S. provides an omni-channel experience to customers, integrating retail stores and eCommerce , through services such as \"Walmart Pickup,\" \"Pickup Today\", \"Grocery Pickup\", \"Grocery Delivery,\" and \"Endless Aisle.\" As of January 31, 2019, we had over 2,100 Grocery Pickup locations and nearly 800 Grocery Delivery locations. Our eCommerce websites include walmart.com, jet.com and others.

Walmart U.S. does business in three strategic merchandise units, listed below: ##TABLE_START  Grocery consists of a full line of grocery items, including meat, produce, natural  organics, deli  bakery, dairy, frozen foods, alcoholic and nonalcoholic beverages, floral and dry grocery, as well as consumables such as health and beauty aids, baby products, household chemicals, paper goods and pet supplies; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Health and wellness includes pharmacy, optical services, clinical services, and over-the-counter drugs and other medical products; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  General merchandise includes: ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Entertainment (e.g., electronics, cameras and supplies, photo processing services, wireless, movies, music, video games and books); ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Hardlines (e.g., stationery, automotive, hardware and paint, sporting goods, outdoor living and horticulture); ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Apparel (e.g., apparel for women, girls, men, boys and infants, as well as shoes, jewelry and accessories); and ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Home/Seasonal (e.g., home furnishings, housewares and small appliances, bedding, home decor, toys, fabrics and crafts and seasonal merchandise). ##TABLE_END Walmart U.S. also offers fuel and financial services and related products, including money orders, prepaid cards, wire transfers, money transfers, check cashing and bill payment. These services total less than 1% of annual net sales. Brand name merchandise represents a significant portion of the merchandise sold in Walmart U.S. We also market lines of merchandise under our private-label brands, including brands such as: \"Athletic Works,\" \"Bonobos,\" \"Equate,\" \"Everstart,\" \"George,\" \"Great Value,\" \"Holiday Time,\" \"Mainstays,\" \"Marketside,\" \"ModCloth,\" \"No Boundaries,\" \"Onn,\" \"Ozark Trail,\" \"Parent's Choice,\" \"Time and Tru\" and \"Wonder Nation.\" The Company also markets lines of merchandise under licensed brands, some of which include: \"Better Homes  Gardens,\" \"Farberware,\" \"Russell\" and \"SwissTech.\" Periodically, revisions are made to the categorization of the components comprising our strategic merchandise units. When revisions are made, the previous periods' presentation is adjusted to maintain comparability. Operations. Many supercenters, discount stores and neighborhood markets are open 24 hours each day. A variety of payment methods are accepted. Seasonal Aspects of Operations. Walmart U.S.'s business is seasonal to a certain extent due to calendar events and national and religious holidays, as well as different weather patterns. Historically, its highest sales volume and segment operating income have occurred in the fiscal quarter ending January 31. Competition. Walmart U.S. competes with omni-channel retailers operating discount, department, retail and wholesale grocers, drug, dollar, variety and specialty stores, supermarkets, hypermarkets and supercenter-type stores, as well as eCommerce retailers. Our ability to develop, open and operate units at the right locations and to deliver a customer-centric omni-channel experience largely determines our competitive position within the retail industry. We employ many programs designed to meet competitive pressures within our industry. These programs include the following: ##TABLE_START  EDLP: our pricing philosophy under which we price items at a low price every day so our customers trust that our prices will not change under frequent promotional activity; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  EDLC: everyday low cost is our commitment to control expenses so our cost savings can be passed along to our customers; and ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Omni-channel offerings such as Walmart Pickup, where a customer places an order online and picks it up for free from a store; Pickup Today, where a customer places an order online and picks it up for free from a store; Grocery Delivery, where a customer places a grocery order online and has it delivered; or Grocery Pickup, where a customer places a grocery order online and picks it up at one of our participating stores or remote locations. ##TABLE_END Distribution. For fiscal 2019 , approximately 77% of Walmart U.S.'s purchases of store merchandise were shipped through our 156 distribution facilities, which are located strategically throughout the U.S. The remaining store merchandise we purchased was shipped directly from suppliers. General merchandise and dry grocery merchandise is transported primarily through the segment's private truck fleet; however, we contract with common carriers to transport the majority of our perishable grocery merchandise. We ship merchandise purchased by customers on our eCommerce platforms by a number of methods from multiple locations including from our 33 dedicated eCommerce fulfillment centers. Walmart International Segment Walmart International is our second largest segment and operates in 26 countries outside of the U.S. Walmart International operates through our wholly-owned subsidiaries in Argentina, Canada, Chile, China, India, Japan and the United Kingdom, as well as Brazil prior to the sale of the majority stake of Walmart Brazil discussed in Note 13 to our Consolidated Financial Statements; and our majority-owned subsidiaries in Africa (which includes Botswana, Ghana, Kenya, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique, Namibia, Nigeria, South Africa, Swaziland, Tanzania, Uganda and Zambia), Central America (which includes Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras and Nicaragua), India and Mexico. Walmart International includes numerous formats divided into three major categories: retail, wholesale and other. These categories consist of many formats, including: supercenters, supermarkets, hypermarkets, warehouse clubs (including Sam's Clubs) and cash  carry, as well as eCommerce through walmart.com.mx, asda.com, walmart.ca, flipkart.com and other sites. Walmart International had net sales of $120.8 billion for fiscal 2019 , representing 24% of our fiscal 2019 consolidated net sales, and had net sales of $118.1 billion and $116.1 billion for fiscal 2018 and 2017 , respectively. The segment's net sales have been negatively impacted by currency exchange rate fluctuations for all years presented. The gross profit rate is lower than that of Walmart U.S. primarily because of its merchandise mix. To deliver strong efficient growth, we have to be decisive when it comes to our capital and our time. As such, we have taken certain strategic actions to reposition Walmart International, including: ##TABLE_START  Acquisition of a majority stake of Flipkart in August 2018 for $16 billion, or $13.8 billion net of cash acquired. We began consolidating Flipkart's results in the third quarter of fiscal 2019, using a one-month lag . The ongoing operations negatively impacted fiscal 2019 net income and this negative impact will continue in fiscal 2020.  ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Proposed combination of J Sainsbury plc and Asda Group Limited (\"Asda\"), our wholly-owned United Kingdom retail subsidiary. Under the terms, we would receive approximately 42 percent of the share capital of the combined company and approximately 3.0 billion in cash, subject to customary closing adjustments, while retaining obligations under the Asda defined benefit pension plan . Due to a complex regulatory review process, the outcome of which is uncertain and may take some time to complete, the held for sale classification criteria for the disposal group has not been met as of January 31, 2019. Further, there can be no assurance as to whether regulatory approval will be obtained or the proposed combination will be consummated. In the future, if the held for sale classification criteria is met for the disposal group, we expect to recognize a loss, the amount of which may fluctuate based on the changes in the value of share capital received and foreign exchange rates. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Divestiture of 80 percent of Walmart Brazil to Advent International (Advent) in August 2018. Advent agreed to contribute additional capital to the business over a three-year period and we agreed to indemnify Advent for certain pre-closing tax and legal contingencies and other matters. We recorded a pre-tax net loss of $4.8 billion in fiscal 2019 for the sale, of which $2.0 billion related to cumulative foreign currency translation loss which was reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive loss. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Consistent with our focus on core retail capabilities, the divestiture of the Walmart Chile banking operations in December 2018 and the proposed divestiture of the Walmart Canada banking operations , classified as held for sale as of January 31, 2019 . ##TABLE_END Omni-channel. Walmart International provides an omni-channel experience to customers, integrating retail stores and eCommerce , such as through services like \"Click  Collect\" in the United Kingdom, our grocery pick-up and delivery business in several other markets, and our marketplaces, such as Flipkart in India. Generally, retail units range in size from 1,500 square feet to 186,000 square feet. Our wholesale stores generally range in size from 25,000 square feet to 155,000 square feet. Other includes stand-alone gas stations operating in the United Kingdom, which range in size up to 2,200 square feet. The following tables provide the unit count (1) and square feet (2) for the fiscal years shown: ##TABLE_START   Africa  Argentina  Brazil (3)  Canada  Central America  Chile Fiscal Year  Unit Count  Square Feet  Unit Count  Square Feet  Unit Count  Square Feet  Unit Count  Square Feet  Unit Count  Square Feet  Unit Count  Square Feet Balance forward   20,513   8,062   32,501   49,914   10,427   13,697   21,223   8,119   33,028   50,927   11,094   14,762   21,869   8,280   30,675   51,784   11,410   15,407   22,542   8,264   30,642   53,088   11,770   15,260   23,134   8,305   29,824   53,082   12,448   15,990   24,317   8,095       53,167   12,978   16,411 ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (1) \"Unit Count\" includes retail stores, wholesale clubs and other.

The merchandising strategy for Walmart International is similar to that of our operations in the U.S. in terms of the breadth and scope of merchandise offered for sale. While brand name merchandise accounts for a majority of our sales, we have both leveraged U.S. private brands and developed market specific private brands to serve our customers with high quality, low priced items. Along with the private brands we market globally, such as \"Equate,\" \"George,\" \"Great Value,\" \"Holiday Time,\" \"Mainstays,\" \"Marketside,\" and \"Parent's Choice,\" our international markets have developed market specific brands including \"Aurrera,\" \"Cambridge,\" \"Lider,\" \"Myntra,\" \"Jabong,\" \"PhonePe,\" and \"Extra Special.\" In addition, we have developed relationships with regional and local suppliers in each market to ensure reliable sources of quality merchandise that is equal to national brands at low prices. Operations. The hours of operation for operating units in Walmart International vary by country and by individual markets within countries, depending upon local and national ordinances governing hours of operation. Operating units in each country accept a variety of payment methods. Seasonal Aspects of Operations. Walmart International's business is seasonal to a certain extent. Historically, the segment's highest sales volume and operating income have occurred in the fourth quarter of our fiscal year. The seasonality of the business varies by country due to different national and religious holidays, festivals and customs, as well as different weather patterns. Competition. Walmart International competes with omni-channel retailers who operate department, drug, discount, variety and specialty stores, supermarkets, hypermarkets and supercenter-type stores, wholesale clubs, home-improvement stores, specialty electronics stores, cash  carry operations and convenience stores, and eCommerce retailers, as well as catalog businesses. Our ability to develop, open and operate units at the right locations and to deliver a customer-centric omni-channel experience largely determines our competitive position within the retail industry. We believe price leadership is a critical part of our business model and we continue to focus on moving our markets towards an EDLP approach. Additionally, our ability to operate food departments effectively has a significant impact on our competitive position in the markets where we operate. Distribution. We utilize a total of 226 distribution facilities located in Argentina, Canada, Central America, Chile, China, Japan, Mexico, South Africa, India and the United Kingdom. Through these facilities, we process and distribute both imported and domestic products to the operating units of the Walmart International segment. During fiscal 2019 , approximately 83% of Walmart International's purchases passed through these distribution facilities. Suppliers ship the balance of Walmart International's purchases directly to our stores in the various markets in which we operate. We ship merchandise purchased by customers on our eCommerce platforms by a number of methods from multiple locations including from our 90 dedicated eCommerce fulfillment centers, as well as more than 1,900 eCommerce sort centers in India. Sam's Club Segment Sam's Club operates in 44 states in the U.S. and in Puerto Rico. Sam's Club is a membership-only warehouse club that also operates samsclub.com. Sam's Club had net sales of $57.8 billion for fiscal 2019 , representing 11% of our consolidated fiscal 2019 net sales, and had net sales of $59.2 billion and $57.4 billion for fiscal 2018 and 2017 , respectively. As a membership-only warehouse club, membership income is a significant component of the segment's operating income. Sam's Club operates with a lower gross profit rate and lower operating expenses as a percentage of net sales than our other segments. Membership. The following two options are available to members: ##TABLE_START  Plus Membership  Club Membership Annual Membership Fee $100  $45 Number of Add-on Memberships ($40 each) Up to 16  Up to 8 Eligible for Cash Rewards Yes  No ##TABLE_ENDAll memberships include a spouse/household card at no additional cost.

The amount earned can be used for purchases, membership fees or redeemed for cash. Plus Members are also eligible for Free Shipping on the majority of merchandise, with no minimum order size, and receive discounts on prescriptions, glasses and contacts. Omni-channel. While Sam's Club is a membership-only warehouse club, it provides an omni-channel experience to customers, integrating retail stores and eCommerce . The warehouse facility sizes generally range between 34,000 and 168,000 square feet, with an average size of approximately 134,000 square feet. The following table provides the retail unit count and retail square feet for the fiscal years shown : ##TABLE_START Fiscal Year  Opened  Closed  Total (1)  Square Feet (1) Balance forward       84,382   (1 )   86,510      87,552   (4 )   88,376   (67 )   80,068     80,240 ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (1) \"Total\" and \"Square Feet\" columns are as of January 31 for the fiscal years shown. \"Square Feet\" column is reported in thousands. ##TABLE_END Members have access to a broad assortment of merchandise, including products not found in our clubs, and services online at samsclub.com and through our mobile commerce applications, providing the option of delivery direct-to-home or to the club through services such as \"Club Pickup.\" Sam's Club omni-channel capabilities also include \"Scan and Go,\" a mobile checkout and payment solution, which allows members to bypass the checkout line. Merchandise. Sam's Club offers merchandise in the following five merchandise categories: ##TABLE_START  Grocery and consumables includes dairy, meat, bakery, deli, produce, dry, chilled or frozen packaged foods, alcoholic and nonalcoholic beverages, floral, snack foods, candy, other grocery items, health and beauty aids, paper goods, laundry and home care, baby care, pet supplies and other consumable items; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Fuel and other categories consists of gasoline stations, tobacco, tools and power equipment, and tire and battery centers; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Home and apparel includes home improvement, outdoor living, grills, gardening, furniture, apparel, jewelry, housewares, toys, seasonal items, mattresses and small appliances; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Technology, office and entertainment includes electronics, wireless, software, video games, movies, books, music, office supplies, office furniture, photo processing and third-party gift cards; and ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Health and wellness includes pharmacy, optical and hearing services and over-the-counter drugs. ##TABLE_END The Member's Mark brand continues to expand assortment and deliver member value. In fiscal 2019 , Member's Mark sales exceeded $12 billion, driven by growth across multiple categories in the private brand portfolio. Operations. Operating hours for Sam's Clubs are generally Monday through Friday from 10:00 a.m. to 8:30 p.m., Saturday from 9:00 a.m. to 8:30 p.m. and Sunday from 10:00 a.m. to 6:00 p.m. Additionally, all club locations offer Plus Members the ability to shop before the regular operating hours Monday through Saturday, starting at 7:00 a.m. A variety of payment methods are accepted. Seasonal Aspects of Operations. Sam's Club's business is seasonal to a certain extent due to calendar events and national and religious holidays, as well as different weather patterns. Historically, its highest sales volume and segment operating income have occurred in the fiscal quarter ending January 31. Competition. Sam's Club competes with other membership-only warehouse clubs, the largest of which is Costco, as well as with discount retailers, retail and wholesale grocers, general merchandise wholesalers and distributors, gasoline stations as well as omni-channel and eCommerce retailers and catalog businesses. At Sam's Club, we provide value at members-only prices, a quality merchandise assortment, and bulk sizing to serve both our Plus and Club members. Our eCommerce website and mobile commerce applications have increasingly become important factors in our ability to compete. Distribution. During fiscal 2019 , approximately 70% of Sam's Club's non-fuel club purchases were shipped from Sam's Club's 23 dedicated distribution facilities, located strategically throughout the U.S., or from some of the Walmart U.S. segment's distribution facilities, which service the Sam's Club segment for certain items. Suppliers shipped the balance of the Sam's Club segment's club purchases directly to Sam's Club locations. Sam's Club ships merchandise purchased on samsclub.com and through its mobile commerce applications by a number of methods from its six dedicated eCommerce fulfillment centers and other distribution centers, including two dedicated import facilities. The principal focus of Sam's Club's distribution operations is on cross-docking merchandise while minimizing stored inventory. Cross-docking is a distribution process under which shipments are directly transferred from inbound to outbound trailers. Shipments typically spend less than 24 hours in a cross-dock facility, and sometimes less than an hour. Sam's Club uses a combination of our private truck fleet, as well as common carriers, to transport non-perishable merchandise from distribution facilities to clubs. The segment contracts with common carriers to transport perishable grocery merchandise from distribution facilities to clubs. Intellectual Property We regard our trademarks, service marks, copyrights, patents, domain names, trade dress, trade secrets, proprietary technologies, and similar intellectual property as important to our success, and with respect to our associates, customers and others, we rely on trademark, copyright, and patent law, trade-secret protection, and confidentiality and/or license agreements to protect our proprietary rights. We have registered, or applied for the registration of, a number of U.S. and international domain names, trademarks, service marks and copyrights. Additionally, we have filed U.S. and international patent applications covering certain of our proprietary technology. We have licensed in the past, and expect that we may license in the future, certain of our proprietary rights to third parties. Suppliers and Supply Chain As a retailer and warehouse club operator, we utilize a global supply chain that includes over 100,000 suppliers located around the world, including in the United States, from whom we purchase the merchandise that we sell in our stores, clubs and online. In many instances, we purchase merchandise from producers located near the stores and clubs in which such merchandise will be sold, particularly products in the \"fresh\" category. Our purchases may represent a significant percentage of a number of our suppliers' annual sales, and the volume of product we acquire from many suppliers allows us to obtain favorable pricing from such suppliers. Our suppliers are subject to standards of conduct, including requirements that they comply with local labor laws, local worker safety laws and other applicable laws. Our ability to acquire from our suppliers the assortment and volume of products we wish to offer to our customer, to receive those products within the required time through our supply chain and to distribute those products to our stores and clubs determines, in part, our in-stock levels in our stores and clubs and the attractiveness of our merchandise assortment we offer to our customers and members. Employees As of the end of fiscal 2019 , Walmart Inc. and our subsidiaries employed more than 2.2 million employees (\"associates\") worldwide, with 1.5 million associates in the U.S. and 0.7 million associates internationally. Similar to other retailers, the Company has a large number of part-time, hourly or non-exempt associates. We believe our relationships with our associates are good. A large number of associates turn over each year, although Walmart U.S. turnover has improved in both fiscal 2019 and 2018 as a result of our focus on increasing wages and providing improved tools, technology and training to associates. Certain information relating to retirement-related benefits we provide to our associates is included in Note 12 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. In addition to retirement-related benefits, in the U.S. we offer a broad range of Company-paid benefits to our associates. These include a store discount card or Sam's Club membership, bonuses based on Company performance, matching a portion of associate purchases of our stock through our Associate Stock Purchase Plan and life insurance. In addition to the health-care benefits for eligible full-time and part-time associates in the U.S., we offer maternity leave and a paid parental leave program to all full-time associates. We also offer a $5,000 benefit to assist eligible associates with adoption. Additionally, we offer eligible associates tuition assistance towards earning a college degree. Similarly, in the operations outside the U.S., we provide a variety of associate benefits that vary based on customary local practices and statutory requirements.

RISK FACTORS ##TABLE_ENDThe risks described below could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. Our business operations could also be affected by additional factors that apply to all companies operating in the U.S. and globally. Strategic Risks General or macro-economic factors, both domestically and internationally, may materially adversely affect our financial performance. General economic conditions and other economic factors, globally or in one or more of the markets we serve, may adversely affect our financial performance. Higher interest rates, lower or higher prices of petroleum products, including crude oil, natural gas, gasoline, and diesel fuel, higher costs for electricity and other energy, weakness in the housing market, inflation, deflation, increased costs of essential services, such as medical care and utilities, higher levels of unemployment, decreases in consumer disposable income, unavailability of consumer credit, higher consumer debt levels, changes in consumer spending and shopping patterns, fluctuations in currency exchange rates, higher tax rates, imposition of new taxes or other changes in tax laws, changes in healthcare laws, other regulatory changes, the imposition of tariffs or other measures that create barriers to or increase the costs associated with international trade, overall economic slowdown or recession and other economic factors in the U.S. or in any of the other markets in which we operate could adversely affect consumer demand for the products we sell in the U.S. or such other markets, change the mix of products we sell to one with a lower average gross margin, cause a slowdown in discretionary purchases of goods, adversely affect our net sales and result in slower inventory turnover and greater markdowns of inventory, or otherwise materially adversely affect our operations and operating results and could result in impairment charges to intangible assets, goodwill or other long-lived assets. In addition, the economic factors listed above, any other economic factors or circumstances resulting in higher transportation, labor, insurance or healthcare costs or commodity prices, and other economic factors in the U.S. and other countries in which we operate can increase our cost of sales and operating, selling, general and administrative expenses and otherwise materially adversely affect our operations and operating results. The economic factors that affect our operations may also adversely affect the operations of our suppliers, which can result in an increase in the cost to us of the goods we sell to our customers or, in more extreme cases, in certain suppliers not producing goods in the volume typically available to us for sale. We face strong competition from other retailers and wholesale club operators which could materially adversely affect our financial performance. Each of our segments competes for customers, employees, digital prominence, products and services and in other important aspects of its business with many other local, regional, national and global eCommerce and omni-channel retailers, wholesale club operators and retail intermediaries. We compete in a variety of ways, including the prices at which we sell our merchandise, merchandise selection and availability, services offered to customers, location, store hours, in-store amenities, the shopping convenience and overall shopping experience we offer, the attractiveness and ease of use of our digital platforms, cost and speed of and options for delivery to customers of merchandise purchased through our digital platforms or through our omni-channel integration of our physical and digital operations. A failure to respond effectively to competitive pressures and changes in the retail markets or delays or failure in execution of our strategy could materially adversely affect our financial performance. See \" Item 1. Business \" above for additional discussion of the competitive situation of each of our reportable segments. Certain segments of the retail industry are undergoing consolidation, which could result in increased competition and significantly alter the dynamics of the retail marketplace. Other segments are substantially reducing operations which could also result in competition rushing to fill the void created by such corporate actions. Such consolidation, or other business combinations or alliances, or reduction in operation may result in competitors with greatly improved financial resources, improved access to merchandise, greater market penetration than they previously enjoyed and other improvements in their competitive positions. Such business combinations or alliances could result in the provision of a wider variety of products and services at competitive prices by such consolidated or aligned companies, which could adversely affect our financial performance. We may not timely identify or effectively respond to consumer trends or preferences, which could negatively affect our relationship with our customers, demand for the products and services we sell, our market share and the growth of our business. It is difficult to predict consistently and successfully the products and services our customers will demand and changes in their shopping patterns. The success of our business depends in part on how accurately we predict consumer demand, availability of merchandise, the related impact on the demand for existing products and the competitive environment. Price transparency, assortment of products, customer experience, convenience, ease and the speed and cost of shipping are of primary importance to customers and continue to increase in importance, particularly as a result of digital tools and social media available to consumers and the choices available to consumers for purchasing products. Our failure to adequately or effectively respond to changing consumer tastes, preferences and shopping patterns, or any other failure on our part to timely identify or effectively respond to changing consumer tastes, preferences and shopping patterns could negatively affect our relationship with our customers, the demand for the products we sell, our market share and the growth of our business. Failure to successfully execute our omni-channel strategy and the cost of our increasing eCommerce investments may materially adversely affect our market position, net sales and financial performance. The retail business is rapidly evolving and consumers are increasingly embracing shopping digitally. As a result, the portion of total consumer expenditures with retailers and wholesale clubs occurring through digital platforms is increasing and the pace of this increase could accelerate. Our strategy, which includes acquisitions, joint ventures, investments in eCommerce, technology, store remodels and other customer initiatives may not adequately or effectively allow us to grow our eCommerce business, increase comparable store sales, maintain or grow our overall market position or otherwise offset the impact on the growth of our business of a moderated pace of new store and club openings. The success of this strategy will depend in large measure on our ability to build and deliver a seamless omni-channel shopping experience and is further subject to the risks we face as outlined in this Item 1A . As a result, our market position, net sales and financial performance could be adversely affected, which could also result in impairment charges to intangible assets or other long-lived assets. In addition, a greater concentration of eCommerce sales could result in a reduction in the amount of traffic in our stores and clubs, which would, in turn, reduce the opportunities for cross-store or cross-club sales of merchandise that such traffic creates and could reduce our sales within our stores and clubs and materially adversely affect our financial performance. Furthermore, the cost of certain eCommerce and technology investments, including any operating losses incurred will adversely impact our financial performance in the short-term and may adversely impact our financial performance over the longer term. The performance of strategic alliances and other business relationships to support the expansion of our business could materially adversely affect our financial performance. We may enter into strategic alliances and other business relationships in the countries in which we have existing operations or in other markets to expand our retail operations. These arrangements may not generate the level of sales we anticipate when entering into the arrangement or may otherwise adversely impact our business and competitive position relative to the results we could have achieved in the absence of such alliance. In addition, any investment we make in connection with a strategic alliance or business relationship could materially adversely affect our financial performance. Operational Risks Natural disasters, changes in climate, and geo-political events could materially adversely affect our financial performance. The occurrence of one or more natural disasters, such as hurricanes, tropical storms, floods, fires, earthquakes, tsunamis, cyclones, typhoons, weather conditions such as major or extended winter storms, droughts and tornadoes, whether as a result of climate change or otherwise, severe changes in climate and geo-political events, such as war, civil unrest or terrorist attacks in a country in which we operate or in which our suppliers are located could adversely affect our operations and financial performance. Such events could result in physical damage to, or the complete loss of, one or more of our properties, the closure of one or more stores, clubs and distribution facilities, the lack of an adequate work force in a market, the inability of customers and associates to reach or have transportation to our stores and clubs affected by such events, the evacuation of the populace from areas in which our stores, clubs and distribution facilities are located, the unavailability of our digital platforms to our customers, changes in the purchasing patterns of consumers and in consumers' disposable income, the temporary or long-term disruption in the supply of products from some suppliers, the disruption in the transport of goods from overseas, the disruption or delay in the delivery of goods to our distribution facilities or stores within a country in which we are operating, the reduction in the availability of products in our stores, the disruption of utility services to our stores and our facilities, and disruption in our communications with our stores. We bear the risk of losses incurred as a result of physical damage to, or destruction of, any stores, clubs and distribution facilities, loss or spoilage of inventory and business interruption caused by such events. These events and their impacts could otherwise disrupt and adversely affect our operations in the areas in which they occur and could materially adversely affect our financial performance. Risks associated with our suppliers could materially adversely affect our financial performance. The products we sell are sourced from a wide variety of domestic and international suppliers. Global sourcing of many of the products we sell is an important factor in our financial performance. We expect our suppliers to comply with applicable laws, including labor, safety, anti-corruption and environmental laws, and to otherwise meet our required supplier standards of conduct. Our ability to find qualified suppliers who uphold our standards, and to access products in a timely and efficient manner, is a significant challenge, especially with respect to suppliers located and goods sourced outside the U.S. Political and economic instability in the countries in which our foreign suppliers and their manufacturers are located, the financial instability of suppliers, suppliers' failure to meet certain of our supplier standards (including our responsible sourcing standards), labor problems experienced by our suppliers and their manufacturers, the availability of raw materials to suppliers, merchandise safety and quality issues, disruption in the transportation of merchandise from the suppliers and manufacturers to our stores, clubs, and other facilities, including as a result of labor slowdowns at any port at which a material amount of merchandise we purchase enters into the markets in which we operate, currency exchange rates, transport availability and cost, transport security, inflation and other factors relating to the suppliers and the countries in which they are located are beyond our control. In addition, the U.S. foreign trade policies, tariffs and other impositions on imported goods, trade sanctions imposed on certain countries, the limitation on the importation of certain types of goods or of goods containing certain materials from other countries and other factors relating to foreign trade are beyond our control. These and other factors affecting our suppliers and our access to products could adversely affect our financial performance. If the products we sell are not safe or otherwise fail to meet our customers' expectations, we could lose customers, incur liability for any injuries suffered by customers using or consuming a product we sell or otherwise experience a material impact to our brand, reputation and financial performance. We may also face reputational and other risks related to third-party sales on our digital platforms. Our customers count on us to provide them with safe products. Concerns regarding the safety of food and non-food products that we source from our suppliers or that we prepare and then sell could cause customers to avoid purchasing certain products from us, or to seek alternative sources of supply for all of their food and non-food needs, even if the basis for the concern is outside of our control. Any lost confidence on the part of our customers would be difficult and costly to reestablish and may also expose us to product liability or food safety claims. As such, any issue regarding the safety of any food or non-food items we sell, regardless of the cause, could adversely affect our brand, reputation and financial performance. In addition, third-parties sell goods on some of our digital platforms, which we refer to as marketplace transactions. The applicability to us of laws related to such sales is currently unsettled and we may face reputational, financial and other risks, including liability, for third-party sales of goods that are counterfeit or otherwise fraudulent. We rely extensively on information systems to process transactions, summarize results and manage our business. Disruptions in our systems could harm our ability to conduct our operations. Given the number of individual transactions we have each year, it is crucial that we maintain uninterrupted operation of our business-critical information systems. Our information systems are subject to damage or interruption from power outages, computer and telecommunications failures, computer viruses, worms, other malicious computer programs, denial-of-service attacks, security breaches (through cyber-attacks from cyber-attackers and sophisticated organizations), catastrophic events such as fires, tornadoes, earthquakes and hurricanes, and usage errors by our associates or contractors. Our information systems are essential to our business operations, including the processing of transactions, management of our associates, facilities, logistics, inventories, physical stores and clubs and our online operations. Our information systems are not fully redundant and if our systems are damaged, breached or cease to function properly, we may have to make a significant investment to repair or replace them, and we may suffer interruptions in our business operations in the interim. Any interruption to our information systems may have a material adverse effect on our business or results of operations. In addition, we are constantly updating our information technology processes and systems. The risk of system disruption is increased when significant system changes are undertaken. If we fail to timely integrate and update our information systems and processes, we may fail to realize the cost savings anticipated to be derived from these initiatives. If the technology-based systems that give our customers the ability to shop with us online do not function effectively, our operating results, as well as our ability to grow our eCommerce business globally, could be materially adversely affected. Increasingly, customers are using computers, tablets, and smart phones to shop with us and with our competitors and to do comparison shopping. We use social media and electronic mail to interact with our customers and as a means to enhance their shopping experience. As a part of our omni-channel sales strategy, in addition to home delivery, we offer \"Walmart Pickup,\" \"Pickup Today,\" \"Club Pickup\" and \"Online Grocery\" programs under which many products available for purchase online can be picked up by the customer at a local Walmart store or Sam's Club, which provides additional customer traffic at such stores and clubs. Omni-channel retailing is a rapidly evolving part of the retail industry and of our operations in the U.S. (whether through organic growth or eCommerce acquisitions) and in a number of markets in which our Walmart International segment operates. We must anticipate and meet our customers' changing expectations while adjusting for technology investments and developments in our competitors' operations through focusing on the building and delivery of a seamless shopping experience across all channels by each operating segment. Any failure on our part to provide attractive, user-friendly secure digital platforms that offer a wide assortment of merchandise at competitive prices and with low cost and rapid delivery options and that continually meet the changing expectations of online shoppers and developments in online and digital platform merchandising and related technology could place us at a competitive disadvantage, result in the loss of eCommerce and other sales, harm our reputation with customers, have a material adverse impact on the growth of our eCommerce business globally and have a material adverse impact on our business and results of operations. Our digital platforms, which are increasingly important to our business and continue to grow in complexity and scope, and the computer and operating systems on which they run, including those applications and systems in our acquired eCommerce businesses, are regularly subject to cyber-attacks. Those attacks involve attempts to gain access to our eCommerce websites (including marketplace platforms) or mobile commerce applications to obtain and make unauthorized use of customers' or members' payment information and related risks discussed below. Such attacks, if successful, may also create denials of service or otherwise disable, degrade or sabotage one or more of our digital platforms and otherwise significantly disrupt our customers' and members' shopping experience. If we are unable to maintain the security of our digital platforms and keep them operating within acceptable parameters, we could suffer loss of sales, reductions in traffic, reputational damage and deterioration of our competitive position and incur liability for any damage to customers whose personal information is unlawfully obtained and used, any of which events could have a material adverse impact on our business and results of operations and impede the execution of our strategy for the growth of our business. Any failure to maintain the security of the information relating to our company, customers, members, associates and vendors, whether as a result of cybersecurity attacks on our information systems or otherwise, could damage our reputation, result in litigation or other legal actions against us, cause us to incur substantial additional costs, and materially adversely affect our business and operating results. As do most retailers, we receive and store in our digital information systems certain personal information about our customers and members, and we receive and store personal information concerning our associates and vendors. Some of that information is stored digitally in connection with our digital platforms. We also utilize third-party service providers for a variety of reasons, including, without limitation, for encryption and authentication technology, content delivery to customers and members, back-office support, and other functions. Such providers may have access to information we hold about our customers, members, associates or vendors. In addition, our eCommerce operations depend upon the secure transmission of confidential information over public networks, including information permitting cashless payments. Cyber threats are rapidly evolving and those threats and the means for obtaining access to information in digital and other storage media are becoming increasingly sophisticated. Cyber threats and cyber-attackers can be sponsored by countries or sophisticated criminal organizations or be the work of single \"hackers\" or small groups of \"hackers.\" Each year, cyber-attackers make numerous attempts to access the information stored in our information systems. As cyber threats evolve, change and become more difficult to detect and successfully defend against, one or more cyber-attacks might defeat our or a third-party service provider's security measures in the future and obtain the personal information of customers, members, associates and vendors. Associate error or malfeasance, faulty password management or other irregularities may also result in a defeat of our or our third-party service providers' security measures and a breach of our or their information systems. Moreover, hardware, software or applications we use may have inherent defects of design, manufacture or operations or could be inadvertently or intentionally implemented or used in a manner that could compromise information security. We or our third-party service providers may not discover any security breach and loss of information for a significant period of time after the security breach occurs. Any breach of our security measures or any breach, error or malfeasance of those of our third-party service providers and loss of our confidential information, or any failure by us to comply with applicable privacy and information security laws and regulations, could cause us to incur significant costs to protect any customers, members, associates and vendors whose personal data was compromised and to restore their confidence in us and to make changes to our information systems and administrative processes to address security issues and compliance with applicable laws and regulations. In addition, such events could be widely publicized and could materially adversely affect our reputation with our customers, members, associates, vendors and shareholders, could harm our competitive position particularly with respect to our eCommerce operations, and could result in a material reduction in our net sales in our eCommerce operations, as well as in our stores thereby materially adversely affecting our operations, net sales, results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and liquidity. Such events could also result in the release to the public of confidential information about our operations and financial condition and performance and could result in litigation or other legal actions against us or the imposition of penalties, fines, fees or liabilities, which may not be covered by our insurance policies. Moreover, a security breach could require us to devote significant management resources to address the problems created by the security breach and to expend significant additional resources to upgrade further the security measures we employ to guard personal information against cyber-attacks and other attempts to access such information and could result in a disruption of our operations, particularly our digital operations. We accept payments using a variety of methods, including cash, checks, credit and debit cards, our private label credit cards and gift cards, and we may offer new payment options over time, which may have information security risk implications. As a retailer accepting debit and credit cards for payment, we are subject to various industry data protection standards and protocols, such as payment network security operating guidelines and the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard. We cannot be certain that the security measures we maintain to protect all of our information technology systems are able to prevent, contain or detect any cyber-attacks, cyber terrorism, or security breaches from known cyber-attacks or malware that may be developed in the future. To the extent that any cyber-attack or incursion in our or one of our third-party service provider's information systems results in the loss, damage or misappropriation of information, we may be materially adversely affected by claims from customers, financial institutions, regulatory authorities, payment card networks and others. In certain circumstances, payment card association rules and obligations to which we are subject under our contracts with payment card processors make us liable to payment card issuers if information in connection with payment cards and payment card transactions that we hold is compromised, which liabilities could be substantial. In addition, the cost of complying with stricter and more complex data privacy, data collection and information security laws and standards could be significant to us. Changes in the results of our retail pharmacy business could adversely affect our overall results of operations, cash flows and liquidity. Walmart has retail pharmacy operations in our Walmart U.S. and Sam's Club segments. A large majority of our retail pharmacy net sales are generated by filling prescriptions for which we receive payment through established contractual relationships with third-party payers and payment administrators, such as private insurers, governmental agencies and pharmacy benefit managers (\"PBMs\"). Our retail pharmacy operations are subject to numerous risks, including: reductions in the third-party reimbursement rates for drugs; changes in our payer mix (i.e., shifts in the relative distribution of our pharmacy customers across drug insurance plans and programs toward plans and programs with less favorable reimbursement terms); changes in third party payer drug formularies (i.e., the schedule of prescription drugs approved for reimbursement or which otherwise receive preferential coverage treatment); growth in, and our participation in or exclusion from, exclusive and preferred pharmacy network arrangements operated by PBMs and/or any insurance plan or program; increases in the prices we pay for brand name and generic prescription drugs we sell; increases in the administrative burdens associated with seeking third-party reimbursement; changes in the frequency with which new brand name pharmaceuticals become available to consumers; introduction of lower cost generic drugs as substitutes for existing brand name drugs for which there was no prior generic drug competition; changes in drug mix (i.e., the relative distribution of drugs customers purchase at our pharmacies between brands and generics); changes in the health insurance market generally; changes in the scope of or the elimination of Medicare Part D or Medicaid drug programs; increased competition from other retail pharmacy operations; further consolidation among third party payers, PBMs or purchasers of drugs; overall economic conditions and the ability of our pharmacy customers to pay for drugs prescribed for them to the extent the costs are not reimbursed by a third party; failure to meet any performance or incentive thresholds to which our level of third party reimbursement may be subject; and changes in the regulatory environment for the retail pharmacy industry and the pharmaceutical industry, including as a result of restrictions on the further implementation of or the repeal of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act or the enactment and implementation of a law replacing such act, and other changes in laws, rules and regulations that affect our retail pharmacy business. If the supply of certain pharmaceuticals provided by one or more of our vendors were to be disrupted for any reason, our pharmacy operations could be severely affected until at least such time as we could obtain a new supplier for such pharmaceuticals. Any such disruption could cause reputational damage and result in a significant number of our pharmacy customers transferring their prescriptions to other pharmacies. One or a combination of such factors may adversely affect the volumes of brand name and generic pharmaceuticals we sell, our cost of sales associated with our retail pharmacy operations, and the net sales and gross margin of those operations or result in the loss of cross-store or cross-club selling opportunities and, in turn, adversely affect our overall net sales, other results of operations, cash flows and liquidity. Our failure to attract and retain qualified associates, increases in wage and benefit costs, changes in laws and other labor issues could materially adversely affect our financial performance. Our ability to continue to conduct and expand our operations depends on our ability to attract and retain a large and growing number of qualified associates globally. Our ability to meet our labor needs, including our ability to find qualified personnel to fill positions that become vacant at our existing stores, clubs and distribution centers, while controlling our associate wage and related labor costs, is generally subject to numerous external factors, including the availability of a sufficient number of qualified persons in the work force of the markets in which we operate, unemployment levels within those markets, prevailing wage rates, changing demographics, health and other insurance costs and adoption of new or revised employment and labor laws and regulations. If we are unable to locate, to attract or to retain qualified personnel, the quality of service we provide to our customers may decrease and our financial performance may be adversely affected. In addition, if our costs of labor or related costs increase for other reasons or if new or revised labor laws, rules or regulations or healthcare laws are adopted or implemented that further increase our labor costs, our financial performance could be materially adversely affected. Financial Risks Fluctuations in foreign exchange rates may materially adversely affect our financial performance and our reported results of operations. Our operations in countries other than the U.S. are conducted primarily in the local currencies of those countries. Our consolidated financial statements are denominated in U.S. dollars, and to prepare those financial statements we must translate the amounts of the assets, liabilities, net sales, other revenues and expenses of our operations outside of the U.S. from local currencies into U.S. dollars using exchange rates for the current period. In recent years, fluctuations in currency exchange rates that were unfavorable have had adverse effects on our reported results of operations. As a result of such translations, fluctuations in currency exchange rates from period-to-period that are unfavorable to us may also result in our consolidated financial statements reflecting significant adverse period-over-period changes in our financial performance or reflecting a period-over-period improvement in our financial performance that is not as robust as it would be without such fluctuations in the currency exchange rates. Such unfavorable currency exchange rate fluctuations will adversely affect the reported performance of our Walmart International operating segment and have a corresponding adverse effect on our reported consolidated results of operations. We may pay for products we purchase for sale in our stores and clubs around the world with a currency other than the local currency of the country in which the goods will be sold. When we must acquire the currency to pay for such products and the exchange rates for the payment currency fluctuate in a manner unfavorable to us, our cost of sales may increase and we may be unable or unwilling to change the prices at which we sell those goods to address that increase in our costs, with a corresponding adverse effect on our gross profit. Consequently, fluctuations in currency exchange rates may adversely affect our results of operations. Failure to meet market expectations for our financial performance could adversely affect the market price and volatility of our stock. We believe that the price of our stock generally reflects high market expectations for our future operating results. Any failure to meet or delay in meeting these expectations, including our comparable store and club sales growth rates, eCommerce growth rates, gross margin, or earnings and earnings per share could cause the market price of our stock to decline, as could changes in our dividend or stock repurchase programs or policies. Additionally, failure of Walmart's performance to compare favorably to that of other retailers may have a negative effect on the price of our stock. Legal, Tax, Regulatory, Compliance, Reputational and Other Risks Our international operations subject us to legislative, judicial, accounting, legal, regulatory, tax, political and economic risks and conditions specific to the countries or regions in which we operate, which could materially adversely affect our business or financial performance. In addition to our U.S. operations, we operate our retail business in Africa, Argentina, Canada, Central America, Chile, China, India, Japan, Mexico and the United Kingdom. During fiscal 2019, our Walmart International operations generated approximately 24% of our consolidated net sales. Walmart International's operations in various countries also sources goods and services from other countries. Our future operating results in these countries could be negatively affected by a variety of factors, most of which are beyond our control. These factors include political conditions, including political instability, local and global economic conditions, legal and regulatory constraints (such as regulation of product and service offerings including regulatory restrictions on eCommerce offerings in international markets, such as India), restrictive governmental actions (such as trade protection measures), local product safety and environmental laws, tax regulations, local labor laws, anti-money laundering laws and regulations, trade policies, currency regulations, laws and regulations regarding consumer and data protection, and other matters in any of the countries or regions in which we operate, now or in the future. Our business and results of operations in the UK may be negatively affected by increases in food costs, changes in trade policies, changes in labor, immigration, tax or other laws and fluctuations in currency exchange rates resulting from the UK's pending exit from the European Union. We expect continued uncertainty around the extent of the impact of this exit on our business until the UK and the European Union put in alternative trade and other arrangements. The economies of some of the countries in which we have operations have in the past suffered from high rates of inflation and currency devaluations, which, if they occurred again, could adversely affect our financial performance. Other factors which may impact our international operations include foreign trade, monetary and fiscal policies of the U.S. and of other countries, laws, regulations and other activities of foreign governments, agencies and similar organizations, and risks associated with having numerous facilities located in countries which have historically been less stable than the U.S. Additional risks inherent in our international operations generally include, among others, the costs and difficulties of managing international operations, adverse tax consequences and greater difficulty in enforcing intellectual property rights in countries other than the U.S. The various risks inherent in doing business in the U.S. generally also exist when doing business outside of the U.S., and may be exaggerated by the difficulty of doing business in numerous sovereign jurisdictions due to differences in culture, laws and regulations. In foreign countries in which we have operations, a risk exists that our associates, contractors or agents could, in contravention of our policies, engage in business practices prohibited by U.S. laws and regulations applicable to us, such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (\"FCPA\"), or the laws and regulations of other countries, such as the UK Bribery Act. We maintain a global policy prohibiting such business practices and have in place a global anti-corruption compliance program designed to ensure compliance with these laws and regulations. Nevertheless, we remain subject to the risk that one or more of our associates, contractors or agents, including those based in or from countries where practices that violate such U.S. laws and regulations or the laws and regulations of other countries may be customary, will engage in business practices that are prohibited by our policies, circumvent our compliance programs and, by doing so, violate such laws and regulations. Any such violations, even if prohibited by our internal policies, could adversely affect our business or financial performance and our reputation. Changes in tax and trade laws and regulations could materially adversely affect our financial performance. In fiscal 2019, our Walmart U.S. and Sam's Club operating segments generated approximately 76% of our consolidated net sales. The federal government has created the potential for significant changes in trade policies, including tariffs and government regulations affecting trade between the U.S. and other countries where we source many of the products we sell in our stores and clubs. Potential changes which have been discussed include the renegotiation or termination of trade agreements and the imposition of higher tariffs on imports into the U.S. A significant portion of the general merchandise we sell in our U.S. stores and clubs is manufactured in other countries. Any such actions could increase the cost to us of such merchandise (whether imported directly or indirectly) and cause increases in the prices at which we sell such merchandise to our customers, which could materially adversely affect the financial performance of our U.S. operations and our business. We are subject to income taxes and other taxes in both the U.S. and the foreign jurisdictions in which we currently operate or have historically operated. The determination of our worldwide provision for income taxes and current and deferred tax assets and liabilities requires judgment and estimation. Our income taxes could be materially adversely affected by earnings being lower than anticipated in jurisdictions that have lower statutory tax rates and higher than anticipated in jurisdictions that have higher statutory tax rates, by changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities, or by changes in worldwide tax laws, regulations, or accounting principles. For example, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the \"Tax Act\") significantly changed income tax laws that affect U.S. corporations and there are aspects of the Tax Act that remain unclear as additional guidance from the U.S. tax authority is pending. As further guidance is issued by the U.S. Treasury Department, the IRS, and other standard-setting bodies, any resulting changes in our estimates will be treated in accordance with the relevant accounting guidance. In addition, we are subject to regular review and audit by both domestic and foreign tax authorities as well as subject to the prospective and retrospective effects of changing tax regulations and legislation. Although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, the ultimate tax outcome may materially differ from the tax amounts recorded in our consolidated financial statements and may materially affect our income tax provision, net income, or cash flows in the period or periods for which such determination and settlement is made. Changes in and/or failure to comply with other laws and regulations specific to the environments in which we operate  could materially adversely affect our reputation, market position, or our business and financial performance. We operate in complex regulated environments in the United States and in the other countries in which we operate and could be adversely affected by changes to existing legal requirements including the related interpretations and enforcement practices, new legal requirements and/or any failure to comply with applicable regulations. Our pharmacy operations in the United States are subject to numerous federal, state and local regulations including licensing and other requirements for pharmacies and reimbursement arrangements. The regulations to which we are subject include, but are not limited to: federal and state registration and regulation of pharmacies; dispensing and sale of controlled substances and products containing pseudoephedrine; applicable governmental payer regulations including Medicare and Medicaid; data privacy and security laws and regulations including the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, the Affordable Care Act, laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment and health and safety matters, including those governing exposure to, and the management and disposal of, hazardous substances; regulations regarding food and drug safety including those of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (the \"FDA\") and the Drug Enforcement Administration (the \"DEA\"), trade regulations including those of the U.S. Federal Trade Commission, and consumer protection and safety regulations including those of the Consumer Product Safety Commission, as well as state regulatory authorities, governing the availability, sale, advertisement and promotion of products we sell and the financial services we offer; anti-kickback laws; false claims laws; and federal and state laws governing health care fraud and abuse and the practice of the professions of pharmacy, optical care and nurse practitioner services. For example, in the United States the DEA and various other regulatory authorities regulate the distribution and dispensing of pharmaceuticals and controlled substances. We are required to hold valid DEA and state-level licenses, meet various security and operating standards and comply with the federal and various state controlled substance acts and related regulations governing the sale, dispensing, disposal and holding of controlled substances. The DEA, the FDA and state regulatory authorities have broad enforcement powers, including the ability to seize or recall products and impose significant criminal, civil and administrative sanctions for violations of these laws and regulations. We are also governed by foreign, national and state laws and regulations of general applicability, including laws and regulations related to working conditions, health and safety, equal employment opportunity, employee benefit and other labor and employment matters, laws and regulations related to competition, and antitrust matters, and health and wellness related regulations for our pharmacy operations outside of the United States. In addition, certain financial services we offer or make available, such as our money transfer agent services, are subject to legal and regulatory requirements, including those intended to help detect and prevent money laundering, fraud and other illicit activity. The impact of new laws, regulations and policies and the related interpretations and changes in enforcement practices or regulatory scrutiny generally cannot be predicted, and changes in applicable laws, regulations and policies and the related interpretations and enforcement practices may require extensive system and operational changes, be difficult to implement, increase our operating costs, require significant capital expenditures, or adversely impact the cost or attractiveness of the products or services we offer. Untimely compliance or noncompliance with applicable laws and regulations could result in the imposition of civil and criminal penalties that could adversely affect the continued operation of our businesses, including: suspension of payments from government programs; loss of required government certifications; loss of authorizations to participate in or exclusion from government programs, including the Medicare and Medicaid programs in the United States; loss of licenses; and significant fines or monetary damages and/or penalties. In addition, failure to comply with applicable legal or regulatory requirements in the United States or in any of the countries in which we operate could result in significant legal and financial exposure, damage to our reputation, and have a material adverse effect on our business operations, financial condition and results of operations. We are subject to certain legal proceedings that may materially adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. We are involved in a number of legal proceedings, which include consumer, employment, tort and other litigation. In particular, we are currently a defendant in a number of cases containing class-action allegations in which the plaintiffs have brought claims under federal and state wage and hour laws, as well as a number of cases containing class-action allegations in which the plaintiffs have brought claims under federal and state consumer laws. In addition, ASDA Stores, Ltd. (\"Asda\"), a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, has been named as a defendant in numerous \"equal value\" claims pending in the Manchester Employment Tribunal (the \"Employment Tribunal\") in the United Kingdom. The claimants, who are current and former Asda store employees, allege that the work performed by female employees in Asda's retail stores is of equal value in terms of, among other things, the demands of their jobs to that of male employees working in Asda's warehouses and distribution facilities, and that the disparity in pay between these different job positions is not objectively justified. The claimants are seeking differential back pay based on higher wage rates in the warehouses and distribution facilities and higher wage rates on a prospective basis. At present, we cannot predict the number of such claims that may be filed, and cannot reasonably estimate any loss or range of loss that may arise from these matters . In December 2017, the United States Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation consolidated numerous lawsuits filed against a wide array of defendants by various plaintiffs, including counties, cities, healthcare providers, Native American tribes, individuals, and third-party payors, asserting claims generally concerning the impacts of widespread opioid abuse. The consolidated multidistrict litigation is entitled In re National Prescription Opiate Litigation  (MDL No. 2804) , and is pending in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Ohio. The Company is named as a defendant in some of the cases included in this multidistrict litigation. Similar cases that name the Company have also been filed in state courts by state, local and tribal governments, health care providers and other plaintiffs. Plaintiffs are seeking compensatory and punitive damages, as well as injunctive relief including abatement. The Company cannot predict the number of such claims that may be filed, and cannot reasonably estimate any loss or range of loss that may arise from such claims. We discuss these cases and other litigation to which we are party below under the caption \" Item 3. Legal Proceedings \" and in Note 10 in the \" Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements ,\" which are part of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. We could be subject to liability, penalties and other sanctions and other adverse consequences arising out of our on-going FCPA matter. As previously disclosed, we are under investigation by the U.S. Department of Justice (the \"DOJ\") and the SEC regarding possible violations of the FCPA. We have been cooperating with those agencies and discussions have been ongoing with them regarding the resolution of these matters. These discussions have progressed to a point that in fiscal 2018, we reasonably estimated a probable loss and recorded an aggregate accrual of $283 million with respect to these matters (the \"Accrual\"). A number of federal and local government agencies in Mexico also investigated these matters. Walmex cooperated with the Mexican governmental agencies that conducted these investigations. Furthermore, lawsuits relating to the matters under investigation were filed by several of our shareholders against us, certain of our current and former directors and former officers and certain of Walmex's former officers. These matters have been resolved or immaterial accruals have been made for proposed settlements. We could be exposed to a variety of negative consequences as a result of the matters noted above. One or more enforcement actions could be instituted in respect of the matters that are the subject of some or all of the on-going government investigations, and such actions, if brought, may result in judgments, settlements, fines, penalties, injunctions, cease and desist orders, debarment or other relief, criminal convictions and/or penalties. Shareholder lawsuits may result in judgments against us and our current and former directors and officers named in those proceedings. We also expect that there will be ongoing media and governmental interest regarding these matters, including additional news articles on these matters that could impact the perception among certain audiences of our role as a corporate citizen. Moreover, we have incurred and expect to continue to incur costs in responding to requests for information or subpoenas seeking documents, testimony and other information in connection with the government investigations, in defending the shareholder lawsuits and with respect to investigations. While we have made an Accrual for these matters, because the discussions are continuing, there can be no assurance as to the timing or the terms of the final resolution of these matters. Although we do not presently believe that these matters, including the Accrual (and the payment of the Accrual at some point-in-time in the future) will have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations or cash flows, given the inherent uncertainties in such situations, we can provide no assurance that these matters will not be material to our business, financial position, results of operations or cash flows in the future. ##TABLE_START ", "1B": " ITEM 1B.

The case citations for the state cases are listed on Exhibit 99.1 to this Form 10-K. II. CERTAIN OTHER PROCEEDINGS: The Company is a defendant in a lawsuit in which the complaint closely tracks the allegations set forth in a news story that appeared in The New York Times (the \"Times\") on April 21, 2012. This is a securities lawsuit, City of Pontiac General Employees Retirement System v. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. , USDC, Western Dist. of AR, that was filed on May 7, 2012, in the United States District Court for the Middle District of Tennessee, and subsequently transferred to the Western District of Arkansas, in which the plaintiff alleges various violations of the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (the \"FCPA\") beginning in 2005, and asserts violations of Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, relating to certain prior disclosures of the Company. The plaintiff seeks to represent a class of shareholders who purchased or acquired stock of the Company between December 8, 2011, and April 20, 2012, and has sought damages and other relief based on allegations that the defendants' conduct affected the value of such stock. On September 20, 2016, the court granted plaintiff's motion for class certification. On October 6, 2016, the defendants filed a petition to appeal the class certification ruling to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit. On November 7, 2016, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit denied the Company's petition. On October 26, 2018, the parties filed a motion asking the court to approve a proposed settlement under which the Company would pay $160 million (the Settlement Amount) to resolve the claims of all class members. On December 6, 2018, the court preliminarily approved the settlement and scheduled the final approval hearing for April 4, 2019. The settlement does not include or constitute an admission, concession, or finding of any fault, liability, or wrongdoing by the Company or any defendant. The Settlement Amount was expensed in the Companys fiscal 2019 financial statements. Securities Class Action : City of Pontiac General Employees Retirement System v. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., USDC, Western Dist. of AR; 5/7/12. III. ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS: Item 103 of SEC Regulation S-K requires disclosure of certain environmental matters. The following matters are disclosed in accordance with that requirement. For the matters listed below, management does not believe any possible loss or the range of any possible loss that may be incurred in connection with each matter, individually or in the aggregate, will be material to the Company's financial condition or results of operations. In September 2018, the United States Environmental Protection Agency (the EPA) notified the Company that it had initiated an administrative penalty action by issuing a Draft Consent Agreement and Final Order. The letter accompanying the Draft Consent Agreement and Final Order alleges that the Company distributed and/or sold three unregistered pesticide products from March 1, 2017 through June 23, 2017. The EPA is seeking a penalty of $960,000. The manufacturer of the product is responsible for ensuring that a FIFRA-regulated product is properly registered prior to its sale. The Company is cooperating with the EPA. In January 2018, the Environmental Prosecutor of the State of Chiapas (Procuradura Ambiental del Estado de Chiapas) in Mexico imposed a fine of approximately $163,000 for the absence of an Environmental Impact Authorization License related to the store Mi Bodega Las Rosas. The Company is challenging the fine. In April 2017, the California Air Resources Board (the \"ARB\") notified the Company that it had taken the position that retailers are required to use unclaimed deposits collected on sales of small containers of automotive refrigerant to fund certain consumer education programs. The ARB alleged that the Company had improperly retained approximately $4.2 million in unclaimed deposits and has sought reimbursement. The Company has denied any wrongdoing. In April 2013, a subsidiary of the Company, Corporacion de Compaias Agroindustriales, operating in Costa Rica, became aware that the Municipality of Curridabat is seeking a penalty of approximately $380,000 in connection with the construction of a retaining wall for a perishables distribution center that is situated along a protected river bank. The subsidiary obtained permits from the Municipality and the Secretaria Tcnica Nacional Ambiental at the time of construction, but the Municipality now alleges that the wall is non-conforming. ##TABLE_START ", "4": " ITEM 4.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS ##TABLE_ENDOverview This discussion, which presents our results for the fiscal years ended January 31, 2019 (\"fiscal 2019 \"), January 31, 2018 (\"fiscal 2018 \") and January 31, 2017 (\"fiscal 2017 \") should be read in conjunction with our Consolidated Financial Statements and the accompanying notes. We intend for this discussion to provide the reader with information that will assist in understanding our financial statements, the changes in certain key items in those financial statements from period to period and the primary factors that accounted for those changes. We also discuss certain performance metrics that management uses to assess the Company's performance. Additionally, the discussion provides information about the financial results of each of the three segments to provide a better understanding of how each of those segments and its results of operations affect the financial condition and results of operations of the Company as a whole. Management measures the results of the Company's segments using each segment's operating income, including certain corporate overhead allocations, as well as other measures. From time to time, we revise the measurement of each segment's operating income and other measures as determined by the information regularly reviewed by our chief operating decision maker. In fiscal 2019, the Company revised certain of its corporate overhead allocations, including depreciation expense, to the operating segments and, accordingly, revised prior period amounts for comparability . Management also measures the results of comparable store and club sales, or comparable sales, a metric that indicates the performance of our existing stores and clubs by measuring the change in sales for such stores and clubs, including eCommerce sales, for a particular period from the corresponding period in the previous year. Walmart's definition of comparable sales includes sales from stores and clubs open for the previous 12 months, including remodels, relocations, expansions and conversions, as well as eCommerce sales. We measure the eCommerce sales impact by including all sales initiated online or though mobile applications, including omni-channel transactions which are fulfilled through our stores and clubs. Sales at a store that has changed in format are excluded from comparable sales when the conversion of that store is accompanied by a relocation or expansion that results in a change in the store's retail square feet of more than five percent. Additionally, sales related to acquisitions are excluded until such acquisitions have been owned for 12 months. Comparable sales are also referred to as \"same-store\" sales by others within the retail industry. The method of calculating comparable sales varies across the retail industry. As a result, our calculation of comparable sales is not necessarily comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. In discussing our operating results, the term currency exchange rates refers to the currency exchange rates we use to convert the operating results for countries where the functional currency is not the U.S. dollar into U.S. dollars or for countries experiencing hyperinflation. We calculate the effect of changes in currency exchange rates as the difference between current period activity translated using the current period's currency exchange rates and the comparable prior year period's currency exchange rates. Additionally, no currency exchange rate fluctuations are calculated for non-USD acquisitions until owned for 12 months. Throughout our discussion, we refer to the results of this calculation as the impact of currency exchange rate fluctuations. Volatility in currency exchange rates may impact the results, including net sales and operating income, of the Company and the Walmart International segment in the future. Our business is seasonal to a certain extent due to calendar events and national and religious holidays, as well as weather patterns. Generally, our highest sales volume and operating income have occurred in the fiscal quarter ending January 31 . We made certain strategic portfolio decisions, further discussed in Item 1. Business , which include the following: ##TABLE_START  Acquisition of 81 percent of the outstanding shares, or 77 percent of the diluted shares, of Flipkart Private Limited (\"Flipkart\") in August 2018. The ongoing operations negatively impacted fiscal 2019 net income and this negative impact will continue in fiscal 2020.  ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Proposed combination of J Sainsbury plc and Asda Group Limited (\"Asda\"), where we would receive approximately 42 percent of the share capital of the combined company, however, the held for sale criteria has not been met as of January 31, 2019. Further, there can be no assurance as to whether regulatory approval will be obtained or the proposed combination will be consummated. In the future, if the held for sale classification criteria is met for the disposal group, we expect to recognize a loss, the amount of which may fluctuate based on the changes in the value of share capital received and foreign exchange rates. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Divestiture of 80 percent of Walmart Brazil to Advent International (\"Advent\") in August 2018, for which we recorded a pre-tax loss of $4.8 billion in fiscal 2019. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Divestiture of banking operations in Walmart Chile in December 2018 and the proposed divestiture of banking operations in Walmart Canada, classified as held for sale as of January 31, 2019. ##TABLE_ENDThe Retail Industry We operate in the highly competitive omni-channel retail industry in all of the markets we serve. We face strong sales competition from other discount, department, drug, dollar, variety and specialty stores, warehouse clubs and supermarkets, as well as eCommerce businesses. Many of these competitors are national, regional or international chains or have a national or international omni-channel or eCommerce presence. We also compete with a number of companies for attracting and retaining quality employees (\"associates\"). We, along with other retail companies, are influenced by a number of factors including, but not limited to: catastrophic events, weather, competitive pressures, consumer disposable income, consumer debt levels and buying patterns, consumer credit availability, cost of goods, currency exchange rate fluctuations, customer preferences, deflation, inflation, fuel and energy prices, general economic conditions, insurance costs, interest rates, labor costs, tax rates, the imposition of tariffs, cybersecurity attacks and unemployment. Further information on the factors that can affect our operating results and on certain risks to our Company and an investment in its securities can be found herein under \" Item 1A. Risk Factors ,\" and under \" Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements .\" Company Performance Metrics We are committed to helping customers save money and live better through everyday low prices, supported by everyday low costs. At times, we adjust our business strategies to maintain and strengthen our competitive positions in the countries in which we operate. We define our financial framework as: ##TABLE_START  strong, efficient growth; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  consistent operating discipline; and ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  strategic capital allocation. ##TABLE_END As we execute on this financial framework, we believe our returns on capital will improve over time. Strong, Efficient Growth Our objective of prioritizing strong, efficient growth means we will focus on the most productive growth opportunities, increasing comparable store and club sales, accelerating eCommerce sales growth and expansion of omni-channel initiatives while slowing the rate of growth of new stores and clubs. At times, we make strategic investments which are focused on the long-term growth of the Company. Comparable sales is a metric that indicates the performance of our existing stores and clubs by measuring the change in sales for such stores and clubs, including eCommerce sales, for a particular period over the corresponding period in the previous year. The retail industry generally reports comparable sales using the retail calendar (also known as the 4-5-4 calendar). To be consistent with the retail industry, we provide comparable sales using the retail calendar in our quarterly earnings releases. However, when we discuss our comparable sales below, we are referring to our calendar comparable sales calculated using our fiscal calendar, which may result in differences when compared to comparable sales using the retail calendar. Calendar comparable sales, as well as the impact of fuel, for fiscal 2019 and 2018 , were as follows: ##TABLE_START   Fiscal Years Ended January 31,        With Fuel  Fuel Impact Walmart U.S.  3.7%  2.1%  0.1%  0.1% Sam's Club  5.4%  2.8%  1.6%  1.0% Total U.S.  4.0%  2.2%  0.4%  0.2% ##TABLE_ENDWalmart U.S. comparable sales increased 3.7% and 2.1% in fiscal 2019 and 2018 , respectively, driven by ticket and traffic growth. Walmart U.S. eCommerce sales positively contributed approximately 1.3% and 0.7% to comparable sales for fiscal 2019 and fiscal 2018 , respectively, as we continue to focus on a seamless omni-channel experience for our customers . Sam's Club comparable sales increased 5.4% and 2.8% in fiscal 2019 and 2018 , respectively. Sam's Club fiscal 2019 comparable sales were driven by strong traffic, which was aided by transfers of sales from our closed clubs to our existing clubs and fuel sales. These increases were partially offset by reduced tobacco sales due to our decision to remove tobacco from certain locations in fiscal 2019 . Sam's Club fiscal 2018 comp sales were driven by strong traffic and fuel sales. Sam's Club eCommerce sales positively contributed approximately 0.9% and 0.7% to comparable sales for fiscal 2019 and 2018 , respectively. Consistent Operating Discipline We operate with discipline by managing expenses, optimizing the efficiency of how we work and creating an environment in which we have sustainable lowest cost to serve. We invest in technology and process improvements to increase productivity, manage inventory and reduce costs. We measure operating discipline through expense leverage, which we define as net sales growing at a faster rate than operating, selling, general and administrative expenses. ##TABLE_START   Fiscal Years Ended January 31, (Amounts in millions, except unit counts)   Net sales  $ 510,329  $ 495,761 Percentage change from comparable period  2.9 %  3.0 % Operating, selling, general and administrative expenses  $ 107,147  $ 106,510 Percentage change from comparable period  0.6 %  4.6 % Operating, selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales  21.0 %  21.5 % ##TABLE_ENDFor fiscal 2019 , operating, selling, general and administrative (\"operating\") expenses as a percentage of net sales decreased 48  basis points, when compared to the same period in the previous fiscal year. The primary drivers of the expense leverage were strong sales performance in conjunction with productivity improvements and lapping fiscal 2018 charges discussed in the following paragraph . The improvements in fiscal 2019 were partially offset by additional investments in eCommerce and technology, as well as a $160 million charge related to a securities class action lawsuit . For fiscal 2018, operating expenses as a percentage of net sales increased 32 basis points, when compared to the previous fiscal year. While our increase in net sales and improving expense management had a positive impact on our operating expenses as a percentage of net sales, we did not leverage expenses as a result of approximately $0.6 billion in charges related to Sam's Club closures and discontinued real estate projects, $400 million related to a lump sum bonus paid to associates, $300 million related to Home Office severance, the legal accrual of $283 million related to the FCPA matter, a charge of $244 million related to discontinued real estate projects in Walmart U.S. and the decisions to exit certain international properties and wind down the first party Brazil eCommerce operations. Strategic Capital Allocation We are allocating more capital to eCommerce, technology, supply chain, and store remodels and less to new store and club openings, when compared to prior years. This allocation aligns with our initiatives of improving our customer proposition in stores and clubs and a seamless omni-channel experience for our customers . Total fiscal 2019 capital expenditures increased slightly compared to the prior year; the following table provides additional detail: ##TABLE_START (Amounts in millions)  Fiscal Years Ended January 31, Allocation of Capital Expenditures   eCommerce, technology, supply chain and other  5,218  4,521 Remodels  2,152  2,009 New stores and clubs, including expansions and relocations  $  $ Total U.S.  7,683  7,444 Walmart International  2,661  2,607 Total capital expenditures  $ 10,344  $ 10,051 ##TABLE_ENDReturns As we execute our financial framework, we believe our return on capital will improve over time. We measure return on capital with our return on assets, return on investment and free cash flow metrics. We also provide returns in the form of share repurchases and dividends, which are discussed in the Liquidity and Capital Resources section. Return on Assets and Return on Investment We include Return on Assets (\"ROA\"), the most directly comparable measure based on our financial statements presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the U.S. (\"GAAP\"), and Return on Investment (\"ROI\") as metrics to assess returns on assets. While ROI is considered a non-GAAP financial measure, management believes ROI is a meaningful metric to share with investors because it helps investors assess how effectively Walmart is deploying its assets. Trends in ROI can fluctuate over time as management balances long-term strategic initiatives with possible short-term impacts. ROA was 3.4% and 5.2% for the fiscal years ended January 31, 2019 and 2018 , respectively. For fiscal 2019 , the decline in ROA was primarily due to the decrease in consolidated net income resulting from the $4.5 billion net loss related to the sale of the majority stake in Walmart Brazil and also the $2.8 billion net unrealized loss on our JD.com investment. For fiscal 2018 , the decline in ROA was primarily due to the loss on extinguishment of debt and the decrease in operating income. ROI was 14.2% for fiscal 2019 , which was flat compared to fiscal 2018 . We define ROI as adjusted operating income (operating income plus interest income, depreciation and amortization, and rent expense) for the trailing 12 months divided by average invested capital during that period. We consider average invested capital to be the average of our beginning and ending total assets, plus average accumulated depreciation and average amortization, less average accounts payable and average accrued liabilities for that period, plus a rent factor equal to the rent for the fiscal year or trailing 12 months multiplied by a factor of 8. Our calculation of ROI is considered a non-GAAP financial measure because we calculate ROI using financial measures that exclude and include amounts that are included and excluded in the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure. For example, we exclude the impact of depreciation and amortization from our reported operating income in calculating the numerator of our calculation of ROI. In addition, we include a factor of 8 for rent expense that estimates the hypothetical capitalization of our operating leases. As mentioned above, we consider ROA to be the financial measure computed in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles most directly comparable to our calculation of ROI. ROI differs from ROA (which is consolidated net income for the period divided by average total assets for the period) because ROI: adjusts operating income to exclude certain expense items and adds interest income; adjusts total assets for the impact of accumulated depreciation and amortization, accounts payable and accrued liabilities; and incorporates a factor of rent to arrive at total invested capital. Because of the adjustments mentioned above, we believe ROI more accurately measures how we are deploying our key assets and is more meaningful to investors than ROA. Although ROI is a standard financial measure, numerous methods exist for calculating a company's ROI. As a result, the method used by management to calculate our ROI may differ from the methods used by other companies to calculate their ROI. Beginning in fiscal 2020, our calculation of ROI will change upon adoption of ASU 2016-02, Leases , primarily to replace the factor of 8 for rent expense with US GAAP operating lease assets. The calculation of ROA and ROI, along with a reconciliation of ROI to the calculation of ROA, the most comparable GAAP financial measure, is as follows: ##TABLE_START   Fiscal Years Ended January 31, (Amounts in millions)   CALCULATION OF RETURN ON ASSETS Numerator     Consolidated net income  $ 7,179  $ 10,523 Denominator     Average total assets (1)  $ 211,909  $ 201,674 Return on assets (ROA)  3.4 %  5.2 %      CALCULATION OF RETURN ON INVESTMENT Numerator     Operating income  $ 21,957  $ 20,437 + Interest income   + Depreciation and amortization  10,678  10,529 + Rent  3,004  2,932 = Adjusted operating income  $ 35,856  $ 34,050      Denominator     Average total assets (1)  $ 211,909  $ 201,674 + Average accumulated depreciation and amortization (1)  85,107  79,995 - Average accounts payable (1)  46,576  43,763 - Average accrued liabilities (1)  22,141  21,388 + Rent x 8  24,032  23,456 = Average invested capital  $ 252,331  $ 239,974 Return on investment (ROI)  14.2 %  14.2 % ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START   As of January 31,     Certain Balance Sheet Data       Total assets  $ 219,295  $ 204,522  $ 198,825 Accumulated depreciation and amortization  87,175  83,039  76,951 Accounts payable  47,060  46,092  41,433 Accrued liabilities  22,159  22,122  20,654 ##TABLE_END(1) The average is based on the addition of the account balance at the end of the current period to the account balance at the end of the prior period and dividing by 2. Free Cash Flow Free cash flow is considered a non-GAAP financial measure.  Management believes, however, that free cash flow, which measures our ability to generate additional cash from our business operations, is an important financial measure for use in evaluating the Company's financial performance. Free cash flow should be considered in addition to, rather than as a substitute for, consolidated net income as a measure of our performance and net cash provided by operating activities as a measure of our liquidity. See Liquidity and Capital Resources for discussions of GAAP metrics including net cash provided by operating activities, net cash used in investing activities and net cash used in financing activities. We define free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities in a period minus payments for property and equipment made in that period. We had net cash provided by operating activities of $27.8 billion , $28.3 billion and $31.7 billion for fiscal 2019 , 2018 and 2017 , respectively. We generated free cash flow of $17.4 billion , $18.3 billion and $21.1 billion for fiscal 2019 , 2018 and 2017 , respectively. Net cash provided by operating activities for fiscal 2019 declined when compared to fiscal 2018 primarily due to timing of vendor payments, partially offset by lower tax payments mainly resulting from U.S. tax reform enacted on December 22, 2017 (\"Tax Reform\") and the timing of tax payments. Free cash flow for fiscal 2019 declined when compared to fiscal 2018  due to the same reasons as the decline in net cash provided by operating activities, as well as $0.3 billion in increased capital expenditures . The decrease in net cash provided by operating activities and free cash flow in fiscal 2018 from fiscal 2017 were primarily due to the timing of tax and other payments, as well as lapping the previous year's improvements in working capital management and the benefit from the application of tax regulations adopted in fiscal 2017. Walmart's definition of free cash flow is limited in that it does not represent residual cash flows available for discretionary expenditures due to the fact that the measure does not deduct the payments required for debt service and other contractual obligations or payments made for business acquisitions. Therefore, we believe it is important to view free cash flow as a measure that provides supplemental information to our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows . Although other companies report their free cash flow, numerous methods may exist for calculating a company's free cash flow. As a result, the method used by management to calculate our free cash flow may differ from the methods used by other companies to calculate their free cash flow. The following table sets forth a reconciliation of free cash flow, a non-GAAP financial measure, to net cash provided by operating activities, which we believe to be the GAAP financial measure most directly comparable to free cash flow, as well as information regarding net cash used in investing activities and net cash used in financing activities. ##TABLE_START   Fiscal Years Ended January 31, (Amounts in millions)    Net cash provided by operating activities  $ 27,753  $ 28,337  $ 31,673 Payments for property and equipment  (10,344 )  (10,051 )  (10,619 ) Free cash flow  $ 17,409  $ 18,286  $ 21,054        Net cash used in investing activities (1)  $ (24,036 )  $ (9,079 )  $ (13,896 ) Net cash used in financing activities  (2,537 )  (19,875 )  (19,072 ) ##TABLE_END(1) \"Net cash used in investing activities\" includes payments for property and equipment, which is also included in our computation of free cash flow.

Net sales increased $14.6 billion or 2.9% and $14.4 billion or 3.0% for fiscal 2019 and 2018 , respectively, when compared to the previous fiscal year. For fiscal 2019 , net sales were positively impacted by overall positive comparable sales for Walmart U.S. and Sam's Club segments, along with positive comparable sales in the majority of our International markets and net sales from Flipkart, which we acquired in the third quarter of fiscal 2019. Additionally, for fiscal 2019 , the increase in net sales was partially offset by a $4.5 billion decrease in net sales due to club closures in the Sam's Club segment during fiscal 2018 , a $ 3.1 billion reduction in net sales due to the sale of the majority stake in Walmart Brazil in the International segment, and $0.7 billion of negative impact from fluctuations in currency exchange rates . For fiscal 2018 , net sales were positively impacted by overall positive comparable sales, the impact from new store openings and sales generated from eCommerce acquisitions. The positive effect of such factors on our consolidated net sales for fiscal 2018 was partially offset by a reduction in net sales of $1.9 billion due to divesting our Yihaodian and Suburbia businesses and the $0.5 billion of negative impact from fluctuations in currency exchange rates. Our gross profit rate decreased 18 and 26 basis points for fiscal 2019 and 2018 , respectively, when compared to the previous fiscal year. For fiscal 2019 , the decrease was due to the mix effects from our growing eCommerce business, the consolidation of Flipkart, our planned pricing strategy and increased transportation expenses. For fiscal 2018 , the decrease was primarily due to our planned pricing strategy and the mix effects from our growing eCommerce business. Membership and other income decreased for fiscal 2019 , when compared to the previous fiscal year, primarily due to the prior year recognition of a $387 million gain from the sale of Suburbia in our International Segment. Membership and other income was relatively flat for fiscal 2018 , when compared to the previous fiscal year. While fiscal 2018 included a $387 million gain from the sale of Suburbia, along with a $47 million gain from a land sale, higher recycling income from our sustainability efforts and higher membership income from increased Plus Member penetration at Sam's Club, these gains were offset by gains recognized in fiscal 2017 . For fiscal 2019 , operating expenses as a percentage of net sales decreased 48 basis points, when compared to the same period in the previous fiscal year. The primary drivers of the expense leverage were strong sales performance in conjunction with productivity improvements and lapping fiscal 2018 charges discussed in the following paragraph . The improvements in fiscal 2019 were partially offset by additional investments in eCommerce and technology, as well as a $160 million charge related to a securities class action lawsuit . For fiscal 2018, operating expenses as a percentage of net sales increased 32 basis points, when compared to the previous fiscal year. While our increase in net sales and improving expense management had a positive impact on our operating expenses as a percentage of net sales, we did not leverage expenses as a result of approximately $0.6 billion in charges related to Sam's Club closures and discontinued real estate projects, $400 million related to a lump sum bonus paid to associates, $300 million related to Home Office severance, the legal accrual of $283 million related to the FCPA matter, a charge of $244 million related to discontinued real estate projects in Walmart U.S. and the decisions to exit certain international properties and wind down the first party Brazil eCommerce operations. Other losses were $8.4 billion for fiscal 2019 , primarily the result of the $4.8 billion pre-tax loss on the sale of the majority stake in Walmart Brazil and a $3.5 billion pre-tax decrease in the market value of our investment in JD.com. Fiscal 2018 results included loss on extinguishment of debt of $3.1 billion . Our effective income tax rate was 37.4% for fiscal 2019 , 30.4% for fiscal 2018 , and 30.3% for fiscal 2017 . Although the U.S. statutory rate was lowered due to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the \"Tax Act\"), our effective income tax rate increased in fiscal 2019 primarily because we recognized minimal tax benefit related to the sale of the majority stake in Walmart Brazil and Flipkart's results. Additionally, our effective income tax rate may also fluctuate as a result of factors including changes in our assessment of certain tax contingencies, valuation allowances, changes in tax law, outcomes of administrative audits, the impact of discrete items and the mix and size of earnings among our U.S. operations and international operations, which are subject to statutory rates that, beginning in fiscal 2019, are generally higher than the U.S. statutory rate. The reconciliation from the U.S. statutory rate to the effective income tax rates for fiscal 2019 , 2018 and 2017 is presented in Note 9 in the \" Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements .\" As a result of the factors discussed above, we reported $7.2 billion and $10.5 billion of consolidated net income for fiscal 2019 and 2018 , respectively, which represents a decrease of $3.3 billion and $3.8 billion for fiscal 2019 and 2018 , respectively, when compared to the previous fiscal year. Diluted net income per common share attributable to Walmart (\"EPS\") was $2.26 , $3.28 and $4.38 for fiscal 2019 , 2018 and 2017 , respectively. Walmart U.S. Segment ##TABLE_START   Fiscal Years Ended January 31, (Amounts in millions, except unit counts)    Net sales  $ 331,666  $ 318,477  $ 307,833 Percentage change from comparable period  4.1 % 3.5 %  3.2 % Calendar comparable sales increase  3.7 %  2.1 %  1.6 % Operating income  $ 17,386  $ 16,995  $ 17,012 Operating income as a percentage of net sales  5.2 %  5.3 %  5.5 % Unit counts at period end  4,769 4,761  4,672 Retail square feet at period end  705  ##TABLE_ENDNet sales for the Walmart U.S. segment increased $13.2 billion or 4.1% and $10.6 billion or 3.5% for fiscal 2019 and 2018 , respectively, when compared to the previous fiscal year. The increases in net sales were primarily due to increases in comparable store sales of 3.7% and 2.1% for fiscal 2019 and 2018 , respectively, driven by ticket and traffic growth. Walmart U.S. eCommerce sales positively contributed approximately 1.3% and 0.7% to comparable sales for fiscal 2019 and 2018 . Additionally, for fiscal 2018 , year-over-year growth in retail square feet further contributed to the year-over-year increase. Gross profit rate decreased 28 and 24 basis points for fiscal 2019 and 2018 , respectively, when compared to the previous fiscal year. For fiscal 2019 , the decrease was primarily due to our planned pricing strategy, increased transportation expenses, and the mix effects from our growing eCommerce business. For fiscal 2018 , the decrease was primarily due to our planned pricing strategy and the mix effects from our growing eCommerce business. Partially offsetting the negative factors for fiscal 2018 was the positive impact of savings from procuring merchandise. Operating expenses as a percentage of segment net sales decreased 23 basis points for fiscal 2019 and was relatively flat for fiscal 2018 , when compared to the previous fiscal year. The decrease in fiscal 2019 was primarily due to strong sales performance in conjunction with productivity improvements and the prior year comparable period including charges related to discontinued real estate projects of $244 million. These improvements more than offset investments in eCommerce, technology and omni-channel initiatives and raising the starting wage rate at the beginning of fiscal 2019. As a result of the factors discussed above, segment operating income increased $391 million for fiscal 2019 and was relatively flat for fiscal 2018 , respectively, when compared to the same periods in the previous fiscal year. Walmart International Segment ##TABLE_START   Fiscal Years Ended January 31, (Amounts in millions, except unit counts)    Net sales  $ 120,824  $ 118,068  $ 116,119 Percentage change from comparable period  2.3 %  1.7 %  (5.9 )% Operating income  $ 4,883  $ 5,229  $ 5,737 Operating income as a percentage of net sales  4.0 %  4.4 %  4.9 % Unit counts at period end  5,993 6,360  6,363 Retail square feet at period end  373  ##TABLE_ENDNet sales for the Walmart International segment increased $2.8 billion or 2.3% and $1.9 billion or 1.7% for fiscal 2019 and 2018 , respectively, when compared to the previous fiscal year. For fiscal 2019 , the increase was primarily due to positive comparable sales in the majority of our markets and net sales from Flipkart, which we acquired in the third quarter of fiscal 2019. These increases were partially offset by a $ 3.1 billion reduction in net sales due to our sale of the majority stake in Walmart Brazil , a $0.7 billion negative impact from fluctuations in currency exchange rates , the continued wind down of our first party Brazil eCommerce operations and a reduction in net sales of $140 million due to divesting our Suburbia business in the second quarter of fiscal 2018. For fiscal 2018 , the increase in net sales was due to positive comparable sales in the majority of our markets and the impact of new stores, partially offset by a reduction in net sales of $1.9 billion due to divesting our Yihaodian and Suburbia businesses and a $0.5 billion negative impact from fluctuations in currency exchange rates. Gross profit rate decreased 41 and 28 basis points for fiscal 2019 and 2018 , respectively, when compared to the previous fiscal year. For fiscal 2019 , the decrease was due to Flipkart and strategic price investments in certain markets. For fiscal 2018 , the decrease in the gross profit rate was primarily due to strategic price investments in certain markets. Membership and other income decreased 22.4% and 14.0% for fiscal 2019 and 2018 , respectively, when compared to the previous fiscal year. The decrease in fiscal 2019 was due to the prior year recognition of a $387 million gain from the sale of Suburbia. While fiscal 2018 included the $387 million gain from the sale of Suburbia and a $47 million gain from a land sale, these gains were less than gains recognized in fiscal  2017 , which included a $535 million gain from the sale of our Yihaodian business and a $194 million gain from the sale of shopping malls in Chile . Operating expenses as a percentage of segment net sales decreased 37 basis points for fiscal 2019 and was flat for 2018 , when compared to the previous fiscal year. The decrease in operating expenses as a percentage of segment net sales for fiscal 2019 was primarily due to impairment charges in the previous fiscal year of approximately $0.5 billion, which included charges from decisions to exit certain properties and wind down the first party Brazil eCommerce operations; this decrease in operating expenses was partially offset by the addition of operating expenses from Flipkart in fiscal 2019 . While fiscal 2018 was benefited by an increase in net sales, this benefit was offset by restructuring and impairment charges in certain markets of approximately $0.5 billion, including charges from decisions to exit certain properties and wind down the first party Brazil eCommerce operations . As a result of the factors discussed above, segment operating income decreased $346 million and $508 million for fiscal 2019 and 2018 , respectively. Sam's Club Segment ##TABLE_START   Fiscal Years Ended January 31, (Amounts in millions, except unit counts)    Including Fuel       Net sales  $ 57,839  $ 59,216  $ 57,365 Percentage change from comparable period  (2.3 )%  3.2 %  0.9 % Calendar comparable sales increase  5.4 %  2.8 %  0.5 % Operating income  $ 1,520  $  $ 1,628 Operating income as a percentage of net sales  2.6 %  1.5 %  2.8 % Unit counts at period end  597  Retail square feet at period end  80         Excluding Fuel (1)       Net sales  $ 52,332  $ 54,456  $ 53,289 Percentage change from comparable period  (3.9 )%  2.2 %  1.8 % Operating income  $ 1,383  $  $ 1,576 Operating income as a percentage of net sales  2.6 %  1.5 %  3.0 % ##TABLE_END (1) We believe the \"Excluding Fuel\" information is useful to investors because it permits investors to understand the effect of the Sam's Club segment's fuel sales on its results of operations, which are impacted by the volatility of fuel prices. Volatility in fuel prices may continue to impact the operating results of the Sam's Club segment in the future. Net sales for the Sam's Club segment decreased $1.4 billion or 2.3% for fiscal 2019 and increased $1.9 billion or 3.2% for fiscal 2018 , when compared to the previous fiscal year. For fiscal 2019 , the decrease was primarily due to a $4.5 billion decrease in net sales resulting from the net closure of 63 clubs during fiscal 2018 , as well as reduced tobacco sales due to our decision to remove tobacco from certain locations. These decreases were partially offset by increases in comparable sales, which were benefited by transfers of sales from our closed clubs to our existing clubs. Sam's Club eCommerce sales positively contributed approximately 0.9% to comparable sales for fiscal 2019 . Additional fuel sales of $0.7 billion partially offset the decreases in net sales for fiscal 2019 . For fiscal 2018 , the increase in net sales was primarily due to an increase in comparable sales which were benefited by an increase of $0.7 billion in fuel sales from higher fuel prices. Sam's Club eCommerce sales positively contributed approximately 0.7% to comparable sales for fiscal 2018 . Gross profit rate was relatively flat for fiscal 2019 and decreased 44 basis points for fiscal 2018 , when compared to the previous fiscal year. For fiscal 2019 , gross profit rate was benefited by lapping the impact of markdowns to liquidate inventory related to club closures in fiscal 2018 and decreased tobacco sales in fiscal 2019 , which have lower margins. This benefit to the gross profit rate was offset by higher transportation costs and eCommerce shipping costs, investments in price and increased shrink in fiscal 2019. For fiscal 2018 , the decrease in gross profit rate was primarily due to the impact of markdowns to liquidate inventory related to club closures, a reclassification of certain supply expenses from operating expenses to cost of goods sold, increased shrink, increased eCommerce shipping costs and the investment in cash rewards. Membership and other income increased 2.6% and 2.3% for fiscal 2019 and 2018 , respectively, when compared to the previous fiscal year. For fiscal 2019 , the increase was due to an increase of 1.5% in membership income resulting from increased Plus Member penetration and gains on property sales. These increases were partially offset by lower recycling income when compared to the previous fiscal year. For fiscal 2018 , the increase in membership and other income was primarily due to higher recycling income from our sustainability efforts and an increase of 1.3% in membership income resulting from increased Plus Member penetration. Operating expenses as a percentage of segment net sales decreased 99 basis points for fiscal 2019 and increased 83 basis points for fiscal 2018 , when compared to the previous fiscal year. For fiscal 2019 , the decrease in operating expenses as a percentage of segment net sales was primarily due to a charge of approximately $0.6 billion in the prior year's comparable period related to club closures and discontinued real estate projects. This charge resulted in the increase in operating expenses as a percentage of segment net sales in fiscal 2018 . As a result of the factors discussed above, segment operating income increased $605 million for fiscal 2019 and decreased $713 million f or fiscal  2018 , when compared to the previous fiscal year. Liquidity and Capital Resources Liquidity The strength and stability of our operations have historically supplied us with a significant source of liquidity. Our cash flows provided by operating activities, supplemented with our long-term debt and short-term borrowings, have been sufficient to fund our operations while allowing us to invest in activities that support the long-term growth of our operations. Generally, some or all of the remaining available cash flow has been used to fund dividends on our common stock and share repurchases. We believe our sources of liquidity will continue to be adequate to fund operations, finance our global investment and expansion activities, pay dividends and fund our share repurchases for the foreseeable future. Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities ##TABLE_START   Fiscal Years Ended January 31, (Amounts in millions)    Net cash provided by operating activities  $ 27,753  $ 28,337  $ 31,673 ##TABLE_ENDNet cash provided by operating activities was $27.8 billion , $28.3 billion and $31.7 billion for fiscal 2019 , 2018 and 2017 , respectively. Net cash provided by operating activities for fiscal 2019 declined when compared to the previous fiscal year primarily due to timing of vendor payments, partially offset by lower tax payments mainly resulting from Tax Reform and the timing of tax payments . The decrease in net cash provided by operating activities for fiscal 2018 , when compared to the previous fiscal year, was due to the timing of tax and other payments, as well as lapping the previous year's improvements in working capital management and the benefit from the application of tax regulations adopted in fiscal 2017. Cash Equivalents and Working Capital Cash and cash equivalents were $7.7 billion and $6.8 billion as of January 31, 2019 and 2018 , respectively. Our working capital deficit was $15.6 billion and $18.9 billion as of January 31, 2019 and 2018 , respectively. We generally operate with a working capital deficit due to our efficient use of cash in funding operations, consistent access to the capital markets and returns provided to our shareholders in the form of payments of cash dividends and share repurchases. The decreased working capital deficit as of January 31, 2019 compared to 2018 was primarily due to higher current assets as a result of the consolidation of Flipkart. Historically, we have used intercompany financing arrangements to make cash available in the country in which it is needed with the minimum cost possible. During fiscal 2019, we repatriated to the U.S. $5.3 billion of cash at a tax cost of approximately $40 million . As of January 31, 2019 and 2018 , cash and cash equivalents of $2.8 billion and $1.4 billion , respectively, may not be freely transferable to the U.S. due to local laws or other restrictions. Of the $2.8 billion as of January 31, 2019 , approximately $1.2 billion can only be accessed through dividends or intercompany financing arrangements subject to approval of the Flipkart minority shareholders; however, this cash is expected to be utilized to fund the operations of Flipkart. Net Cash Used in Investing Activities ##TABLE_START   Fiscal Years Ended January 31, (Amounts in millions)    Net cash used in investing activities  $ (24,036 )  $ (9,079 )  $ (13,896 ) ##TABLE_ENDNet cash used in investing activities was $24.0 billion , $9.1 billion and $13.9 billion for fiscal 2019 , 2018 and 2017 , respectively, and generally consisted of payments for business acquisitions and to expand our eCommerce capabilities, invest in other technologies, remodel existing stores and club and add new stores and clubs. Net cash used in investing activities increased $15.0 billion for fiscal 2019 when compared to the previous fiscal year. This increase was primarily due to the $13.8 billion payment for Flipkart , net of cash acquired, as well as payments for other, smaller acquisitions. Net cash used in investing activities decreased $4.8 billion for fiscal 2018 when compared to the previous fiscal year. Fiscal 2018 included cash received of $1.0 billion from the sale of Suburbia in Mexico, while fiscal 2017 included our acquisition of Jet.com, Inc. (\"jet.com\") for $2.4 billion and our purchase of $1.9 billion of shares in JD.com (\"JD\"). Refer to Note 13 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for further details on our acquisition of jet.com and investment in JD. Additionally, refer to the \" Strategic Capital Allocation \" section in our Company Performance Metrics for capital expenditure detail for fiscal 2019 and 2018 . Growth Activities For the fiscal year ending January 31, 2020 (\"fiscal 2020 \"), we project capital expenditures will be approximately $11.0 billion. In fiscal 2020 , we expect to add approximately 300 new stores in Walmart International, primarily in Mexico, Central America and China, and add less than 10 stores in Walmart U.S. Net Cash Used in Financing Activities ##TABLE_START   Fiscal Years Ended January 31, (Amounts in millions)    Net cash used in financing activities  $ (2,537 )  $ (19,875 )  $ (19,072 ) ##TABLE_ENDNet cash used in financing activities generally consists of transactions related to our short-term and long-term debt, financing obligations, dividends paid and the repurchase of Company stock. Transactions with noncontrolling interest shareholders are also classified as cash flows from financing activities. Fiscal 2019 net cash used in financing activities decreased $17.3 billion when compared to the same period in the previous fiscal year. The decrease was primarily due to the $15.9 billion of net proceeds received from the issuance of long-term debt to fund a portion of the purchase price for Flipkart and for general corporate purposes, as well as a decrease in share repurchases due to the suspension of repurchases in anticipation of the Flipkart announcement. Fiscal 2018 net cash used in financing activities increased $0.8 billion for fiscal 2018 when compared to the same period in the previous fiscal year. The increase was primarily due to premiums paid for early extinguishment of debt. Further discussion of financing activities is provided by major categories below. Short-term Borrowings Net cash flows provided by short-term borrowings were relatively flat in fiscal 2019 and increased $4.1 billion in fiscal 2018 , when compared to the balance at the end of the previous fiscal year. We generally utilize the liquidity provided by short-term borrowings to provide funding for our operations, dividend payments, share repurchases, capital expenditures and other cash requirements. For fiscal 2018 , the additional cash provided by short-term borrowings was primarily due to the timing of our January 2018 debt extinguishment. The following table includes additional information related to the Company's short-term borrowings for fiscal 2019 , 2018 and 2017 : ##TABLE_START   Fiscal Years Ended January 31, (Amounts in millions)    Maximum amount outstanding at any month-end  $ 13,389  $ 11,386  $ 9,493 Average daily short-term borrowings  10,625  8,131  5,691 Annual weighted-average interest rate  2.4 %  1.3 %  1.8 % ##TABLE_ENDIn addition to our short-term borrowings, we have $15.0 billion of various undrawn committed lines of credit in the U.S. and approximately $2.8 billion of various undrawn committed lines of credit outside of the U.S. , as of January 31, 2019 , that provide additional liquidity, if needed. Long-term Debt The following table provides the changes in our long-term debt for fiscal 2019 : ##TABLE_START (Amounts in millions)  Long-term debt due within one year  Long-term debt  Total Balances as of February 1, 2018  $ 3,738  $ 30,045  $ 33,783 Proceeds from issuance of long-term debt    15,872  15,872 Payments of long-term debt  (3,763 )  (21 )  (3,784 ) Reclassifications of long-term debt  1,864  (1,864 )   Other   (512 )  (475 ) Balances as of January 31, 2019  $ 1,876  $ 43,520  $ 45,396 ##TABLE_ENDOur total long-term debt increased $11.6 billion for fiscal 2019 , primarily due to the net proceeds from issuance of long-term debt to fund a portion of the purchase price for Flipkart and for general corporate purposes . Dividends Our total dividend payments were $6.1 billion , $6.1 billion and $6.2 billion for fiscal 2019 , 2018 and 2017 , respectively. The Board of Directors approved, effective February 19, 2019 , the fiscal 2020 annual dividend of $2.12 per share, an increase over the fiscal 2019 annual dividend of $2.08 per share. For fiscal 2020 , the annual dividend will be paid in four quarterly installments of $0.53 per share, according to the following record and payable dates: ##TABLE_START Record Date  Payable Date March 15, 2019  April 1, 2019 May 10, 2019  June 3, 2019 August 9, 2019  September 3, 2019 December 6, 2019  January 2, 2020 ##TABLE_ENDCompany Share Repurchase Program From time to time, the Company repurchases shares of its common stock under share repurchase programs authorized by the Company's Board of Directors. All repurchases made during fiscal 2019  were made under the current  $20 billion  share repurchase program approved in October 2017, which has no expiration date or other restrictions limiting the period over which the Company can make share repurchases. As of January 31, 2019 , authorization for $11.3 billion  of share repurchases remained under the share repurchase program. Any repurchased shares are constructively retired and returned to an unissued status.  We regularly review share repurchase activity and consider several factors in determining when to execute share repurchases, including, among other things, current cash needs, capacity for leverage, cost of borrowings, our results of operations and the market price of our common stock. We anticipate that a majority of the ongoing share repurchase program will be funded through the Company's free cash flow. The following table provides, on a settlement date basis, the number of shares repurchased, average price paid per share and total amount paid for share repurchases for fiscal 2019 , 2018 and 2017 : ##TABLE_START   Fiscal Years Ended January 31, (Amounts in millions, except per share data)    Total number of shares repurchased  79.5  104.9  119.9 Average price paid per share  $ 93.18  $ 79.11  $ 69.18 Total amount paid for share repurchases  $ 7,410  $ 8,296  $ 8,298 ##TABLE_ENDShare repurchases decreased for fiscal 2019 and were relatively flat for fiscal 2018 , respectively, when compared to the previous fiscal year. The decrease in fiscal 2019 was due to the suspension of repurchases in anticipation of the announcement of the Flipkart acquisition. Repurchases of Company stock returned to a more normalized level in the latter half of fiscal 2019. Capital Resources We believe cash flows from operations, our current cash position and access to capital markets will continue to be sufficient to meet our anticipated operating cash needs, which include funding seasonal buildups in merchandise inventories and funding our capital expenditures, acquisitions, dividend payments and share repurchases. We have strong commercial paper and long-term debt ratings that have enabled and should continue to enable us to refinance our debt as it becomes due at favorable rates in capital markets. As of January 31, 2019 , the ratings assigned to our commercial paper and rated series of our outstanding long-term debt were as follows: ##TABLE_START Rating agency  Commercial paper  Long-term debt Standard  Poor's  A-1+  AA Moody's Investors Service  P-1  Aa2 Fitch Ratings  F1+  AA ##TABLE_ENDCredit rating agencies review their ratings periodically and, therefore, the credit ratings assigned to us by each agency may be subject to revision at any time. Accordingly, we are not able to predict whether our current credit ratings will remain consistent over time. Factors that could affect our credit ratings include changes in our operating performance, the general economic environment, conditions in the retail industry, our financial position, including our total debt and capitalization, and changes in our business strategy. Any downgrade of our credit ratings by a credit rating agency could increase our future borrowing costs or impair our ability to access capital and credit markets on terms commercially acceptable to us. In addition, any downgrade of our current short-term credit ratings could impair our ability to access the commercial paper markets with the same flexibility that we have experienced historically, potentially requiring us to rely more heavily on more expensive types of debt financing. The credit rating agency ratings are not recommendations to buy, sell or hold our commercial paper or debt securities. Each rating may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating organization and should be evaluated independently of any other rating. Moreover, each credit rating is specific to the security to which it applies. Contractual Obligations The following table sets forth certain information concerning our obligations to make contractual future payments, such as debt and lease agreements, and certain contingent commitments as of January 31, 2019 : ##TABLE_START   Payments Due During Fiscal Years Ending January 31, (Amounts in millions) Total 2021-2022 2023-2024 Thereafter Recorded contractual obligations: Long-term debt (1) $ 45,396 $ 1,876 $ 8,427 $ 7,439 $ 27,654 Short-term borrowings 5,225 5,225    Capital lease and financing obligations (2) 9,896 1,650 1,260 6,069 Unrecorded contractual obligations: Non-cancelable operating leases (3) 14,118 1,856 3,075 2,296 6,891 Estimated interest on long-term debt 23,039 1,745 3,219 2,851 15,224 Syndicated and other letters of credit 2,180 2,180    Purchase obligations 14,343 7,325 4,249 1,441 1,328 Total contractual obligations $ 114,197 $ 21,124 $ 20,620 $ 15,287 $ 57,166 ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (1) \"Long-term debt\" includes the fair value of our derivatives designated as fair value hedges. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (2) \"Capital lease and financing obligations\" represents undiscounted aggregate minimum annual rentals, which are recorded on the balance sheet at present value. Refer to Note 11 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for more information. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (3) Represents minimum contractual obligation for non-cancelable leases with initial or remaining terms greater than 12 months as of January 31, 2019 . ##TABLE_END Under the terms of the sale of the majority stake of Walmart Brazil, we agreed to indemnify Advent for certain pre-closing tax and legal contingencies and other matters for up to R$2.3 billion , adjusted for interest based on the Brazilian interbank deposit rate. As of January 31, 2019 , the indemnification liability recorded was $0.8 billion and included in deferred income taxes and other in the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheet. Additionally, we have $15.0 billion of various undrawn committed lines of credit in the U.S. and approximately $2.8 billion of various undrawn committed lines of credit outside of the U.S. which, if drawn upon, would be included in the current liabilities section of the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets. Estimated interest payments are based on our principal amounts and expected maturities of all debt outstanding as of January 31, 2019 , and assumes interest rates remain at current levels for our variable rate debt. Purchase obligations include legally binding contracts, such as firm commitments for inventory and utility purchases, as well as commitments to make capital expenditures, software acquisition and license commitments and legally binding service contracts. For the purposes of the above table, contractual obligations for the purchase of goods or services are defined as agreements that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms, including: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed, minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. Contracts that specify the Company will purchase all or a portion of its requirements of a specific product or service from a supplier, but do not include a fixed or minimum quantity, are excluded from the table above. Accordingly, purchase orders for inventory are not included in the table above as purchase orders represent authorizations to purchase rather than binding agreements. Our purchase orders are based on our current inventory needs and are fulfilled by our suppliers within short time periods. We also enter into contracts for outsourced services; however, the obligations under these contracts are not significant and the contracts generally contain clauses allowing for cancellation without significant penalty. The expected timing for payment discussed above is estimated based on current information. Timing of payments and actual amounts paid may be different depending on the timing of receipt of goods or services or changes to agreed-upon amounts for some obligations. In addition to the amounts shown in the table above, $1.3 billion of unrecognized tax benefits are considered uncertain tax positions and have been recorded as liabilities. The timing of the payment, if any, associated with these liabilities is uncertain. Refer to Note 9 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion of unrecognized tax benefits. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements As of January 31, 2019 , we had no off-balance sheet arrangements that have, or are reasonably likely to have, a current or future material effect on our consolidated financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources.

Summary of Critical Accounting Estimates Management strives to report our financial results in a clear and understandable manner, although in some cases accounting and disclosure rules are complex and require us to use technical terminology. In preparing the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements, we follow accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. These principles require us to make certain estimates and apply judgments that affect our financial position and results of operations as reflected in our financial statements. These judgments and estimates are based on past events and expectations of future outcomes. Actual results may differ from our estimates. Management continually reviews our accounting policies, how they are applied and how they are reported and disclosed in our financial statements. Following is a summary of our critical accounting estimates and how they are applied in preparation of the financial statements. Inventories We value inventories at the lower of cost or market as determined primarily by the retail inventory method of accounting, using the last-in, first-out (\"LIFO\") method for Walmart U.S. segment's inventories. The inventory at the Sam's Club segment is valued using the weighted-average cost LIFO method. When necessary, we record a LIFO provision for the estimated annual effect of inflation, and these estimates are adjusted to actual results determined at year-end. Our LIFO provision is calculated based on inventory levels, markup rates and internally generated retail price indices. As a measure of sensitivity, a 1% increase to our retail price indices would not have resulted in a decrease to the carrying value of inventory. As of January 31, 2019 and 2018 , our inventories valued at LIFO approximated those inventories as if they were valued at FIFO. Impairment of Assets We evaluate long-lived assets for indicators of impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate their carrying amounts may not be recoverable. Management's judgments regarding the existence of impairment indicators are based on market conditions and financial performance. The evaluation of long-lived assets is performed at the lowest level of identifiable cash flows, which is generally at the individual store level. The variability of these factors depends on a number of conditions, including uncertainty about future events and changes in demographics. Thus, our accounting estimates may change from period to period. These factors could cause management to conclude that indicators of impairment exist and require impairment tests be performed, which could result in management determining the value of long-lived assets is impaired, resulting in a write-down of the related long-lived assets. While fiscal 2019 included a pre-tax loss of $4.8 billion related to the sale of the majority stake in Walmart Brazil, which included full impairment of all related-assets, there were no other material impairment charges for fiscal 2019. As a measure of sensitivity, fiscal 2019 impairment would not change materially with a 10% decrease in the undiscounted cash flows for the stores or clubs with indicators of impairment. For fiscal 2018, although impairment charges were $1.4 billion, these charges primarily related to restructuring activities described in  Note 14 , as well as discontinued real estate projects in the U.S. and decisions to exit certain international properties . Impairment charges not related to restructuring activities or decisions to exit properties for fiscal 2019 and 2018 were not material. Business Combinations, Goodwill, and Acquired Intangible Assets We account for business combinations using the acquisition method of accounting, which requires that once control is obtained, all the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, including amounts attributable to noncontrolling interests, be recorded at their respective fair values at the date of acquisition. The determination of fair values of identifiable assets and liabilities requires estimates and the use of valuation techniques when market value is not readily available. For intangible assets acquired in a business combination, we typically use the income method. Significant estimates in valuing certain intangible assets include, but are not limited to, the amount and timing of future cash flows, growth rates, discount rates and useful lives. The excess of the purchase price over fair values of identifiable assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill. Goodwill is assigned to the reporting unit which consolidates the acquisition. Components within the same reportable segment are aggregated and deemed a single reporting unit if the components have similar economic characteristics. As of January 31, 2019 , our reporting units consisted of Walmart U.S., Walmart International and Sam's Club. Goodwill and other indefinite-lived acquired intangible assets are not amortized, but are evaluated for impairment annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the value of a certain asset may be impaired. Generally, this evaluation begins with a qualitative assessment to determine whether a quantitative impairment test is necessary. If we determine, after performing an assessment based on the qualitative factors, that the fair value of the reporting unit is more likely than not less than the carrying amount, or that a fair value of the reporting unit substantially in excess of the carrying amount cannot be assured, then a quantitative impairment test would be performed. The quantitative test for impairment requires management to make judgments relating to future cash flows, growth rates and economic and market conditions. These evaluations are based on determining the fair value of a reporting unit or asset using a valuation method such as discounted cash flow or a relative, market-based approach. Historically, our reporting units and other indefinite-lived acquired intangible assets have generated sufficient returns to recover the cost of goodwill and other indefinite-lived acquired intangible assets. Because of the nature of the factors used in these tests, if different conditions occur in future periods, future operating results could be materially impacted. For approximately $300 million of certain acquired indefinite-lived intangible assets, the fair value approximated the carrying value; any deterioration in the fair value may result in an impairment charge. Income Taxes Income taxes have a significant effect on our net earnings. We are subject to income taxes in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Accordingly, the determination of our provision for income taxes requires significant judgment, the use of estimates and the interpretation and application of complex tax laws. Our effective income tax rate is affected by many factors, including changes in our assessment of certain tax contingencies, increases and decreases in valuation allowances, changes in tax law, outcomes of administrative audits, the impact of discrete items and the mix of earnings among our U.S. and international operations where the statutory rates are generally lower than the U.S. statutory rate, and may fluctuate as a result. Our tax returns are routinely audited and settlements of issues raised in these audits sometimes affect our tax provisions. The benefits of uncertain tax positions are recorded in our financial statements only after determining a more likely than not probability that the uncertain tax positions will withstand challenge, if any, from taxing authorities. When facts and circumstances change, we reassess these probabilities and record any changes in the financial statements as appropriate. We account for uncertain tax positions by determining the minimum recognition threshold that a tax position is required to meet before being recognized in the financial statements. This determination requires the use of significant judgment in evaluating our tax positions and assessing the timing and amounts of deductible and taxable items. Deferred tax assets represent amounts available to reduce income taxes payable on taxable income in future years. Such assets arise because of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities, as well as from net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets are evaluated for future realization and reduced by a valuation allowance to the extent that a portion is not more likely than not to be realized. Many factors are considered when assessing whether it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will be realized, including recent cumulative earnings, expectations of future taxable income, carryforward periods and other relevant quantitative and qualitative factors. The recoverability of the deferred tax assets is evaluated by assessing the adequacy of future expected taxable income from all sources, including reversal of taxable temporary differences, forecasted operating earnings and available tax planning strategies. This evaluation relies heavily on estimates. On December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the \"Tax Act\") was enacted and contains significant changes to U.S. income tax law. Effective beginning January 2018, the Tax Act reduced the U.S. statutory tax rate from 35% to 21% and created new taxes on foreign-sourced earnings and related-party payments. As discussed in Note 9 to our Consolidated Financial Statements, we completed our accounting for the tax effects of the Tax Act in fiscal 2019. As further guidance is issued by the U.S. Treasury Department, the IRS, and other standardsetting bodies, any resulting changes to our estimates will be treated in accordance with the relevant accounting guidance. ##TABLE_START ", "7A": " ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK ##TABLE_ENDMarket Risk In addition to the risks inherent in our operations, we are exposed to certain market risks, including changes in interest rates, currency exchange rates and the fair value of our equity investment in JD.com. The analysis presented below for each of our market risk sensitive instruments is based on a hypothetical scenario used to calibrate potential risk and does not represent our view of future market changes. The effect of a change in a particular assumption is calculated without adjusting any other assumption. In reality, however, a change in one factor could cause a change in another, which may magnify or negate other sensitivities. Interest Rate Risk We are exposed to changes in interest rates as a result of our short-term borrowings and long-term debt. We hedge a portion of our interest rate risk by managing the mix of fixed and variable rate debt and by entering into interest rate swaps. For fiscal 2019 , the net fair value of our interest rate swaps increased  $13 million primarily due to fluctuations in market interest rates. The table below provides information about our financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in interest rates. For long-term debt, the table represents the principal cash flows and related weighted-average interest rates by expected maturity dates. For interest rate swaps, the table represents the contractual cash flows and weighted-average interest rates by the contractual maturity date, unless otherwise noted. The notional amounts are used to calculate contractual cash flows to be exchanged under the contracts. The weighted-average variable rates are based upon prevailing market rates as of January 31, 2019 . ##TABLE_START   Expected Maturity Date (Amounts in millions)  Fiscal 2020  Fiscal 2021  Fiscal 2022  Fiscal 2023  Fiscal 2024  Thereafter  Total Liabilities               Short-term borrowings:               Variable rate  $ 5,225  $   $   $   $   $   $ 5,225 Weighted-average interest rate  2.7 %   %   %   %   %   %  2.7 % Long-term debt (1) :               Fixed rate  $ 1,576  $ 4,597  $ 2,330  $ 2,844  $ 4,595  $ 27,654  $ 43,596 Weighted-average interest rate  2.5 %  2.9 %  3.7 %  1.7 %  3.2 %  4.5 %  3.9 % Variable rate  $  $  $  $   $   $   $ 1,800 Weighted-average interest rate  2.8 %  2.9 %  3.1 %   %   %   %  2.9 % Interest rate derivatives               Interest rate swaps:               Fixed to variable  $   $  $   $   $ 1,750  $ 1,500  $ 4,000 Weighted-average pay rate   %  4.1 %   %   %  3.2 %  3.8 %  3.6 % Weighted-average receive rate   %  3.3 %   %   %  2.6 %  3.3 %  3.0 % ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (1) The long-term debt amounts in the table exclude the Company's derivatives classified as fair value hedges. ##TABLE_END As of January 31, 2019 , our variable rate borrowings, including the effect of our commercial paper and interest rate swaps, represented 22% of our total short-term and long-term debt. Based on January 31, 2019 debt levels, a 100 basis point change in prevailing market rates would cause our annual interest costs to change by approximately $110 million . Foreign Currency Risk We are exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates as a result of our net investments and operations in countries other than the U.S, as well our foreign-currency-denominated long-term debt. For fiscal 2019 , movements in currency exchange rates and the related impact on the translation of the balance sheets of the Company's subsidiaries in the UK, Chile, and Canada were the primary cause of the $2.1 billion loss in the currency translation and other category of accumulated other comprehensive loss. We hedge a portion of our foreign currency risk by entering into currency swaps. The aggregate fair value of these swaps was in an asset position of $62 million and $413 million as of January 31, 2019 and January 31, 2018 , respectively. The change in the fair value of these swaps was due to fluctuations in currency exchange rates, primarily the strengthening of the U.S. dollar relative to other currencies in fiscal 2019 . A hypothetical 10% change in the currency exchange rates underlying these swaps from the market rate as of January 31, 2019 would have resulted in a change in the value of the swaps of $515 million . A hypothetical 10% change in interest rates underlying these swaps from the market rates in effect as of January 31, 2019 would have resulted in a change in the value of the swaps of $13 million . In addition to currency swaps, we also hedge a portion of our foreign currency risk by designating foreign-currency-denominated long-term debt as nonderivative hedges of net investments of certain of our foreign operations. We had outstanding long-term debt of 1.7 billion as of January 31, 2019 and January 31, 2018 that was designated as a hedge of our net investment in the United Kingdom. As of January 31, 2019 , a hypothetical 10% increase or decrease in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to the British pound would have resulted in a change in the value of the debt of $201 million . In addition, we had outstanding long-term debt of 180 billion as of January 31, 2019 and January 31, 2018 that was designated as a hedge of our net investment in Japan. As of January 31, 2019 , a hypothetical 10% change in value of the U.S. dollar relative to the Japanese yen would have resulted in a change in the value of the debt of $150 million . In certain countries, we also enter into immaterial foreign currency forward contracts to hedge the purchase and payment of purchase commitments denominated in non-functional currencies. Investment Risk We are exposed to changes in the JD.com (\"JD\") stock price as a result of our equity investment in JD. Since February 1, 2018, when we adopted the new financial instrument accounting standard, the change in fair value recorded within other gains and losses resulted in a loss of $3.5 billion due to a decrease in the stock price of JD. As of January 31, 2019 , the fair value of our equity investment in JD was $3.6 billion . ##TABLE_START ", "8": " ITEM 8.

Adoption of ASU No. 2016-01 As discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company changed its method of measuring certain equity investments to fair value and recognizing the change in fair value in net income effective February 1, 2018, due to the adoption of Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2016-01, Financial Instruments-Overall (Topic 825) . Basis for Opinion These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Companys financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. /s/ Ernst  Young LLP  We have served as the Company's auditor since 1969. Rogers, Arkansas March 28, 2019 Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm To the Shareholders and the Board of Directors of Walmart Inc. Opinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting We have audited Walmart Inc.'s internal control over financial reporting as of January 31, 2019 , based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the COSO criteria). In our opinion, Walmart Inc. (the Company) maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of January 31, 2019 , based on the COSO criteria. As indicated in the accompanying Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting, managements assessment of and conclusion on the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting did not include the internal controls of Flipkart Private Limited (Flipkart), except for the recognition of goodwill and intangible assets that were included in managements assessment. Flipkart is included in the 2019 consolidated financial statements of the Company and constituted approximately 2% of the Companys total assets as of January 31, 2019 after excluding goodwill and intangible assets recorded and approximately 1% of the Companys net sales for the year ended January 31, 2019. Accordingly, our audit of internal control over financial reporting of the Company also did not include an evaluation of the internal control over financial reporting of Flipkart, except for the recognition of goodwill and intangible assets. We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Walmart Inc. as of January 31, 2019 and 2018 , the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, shareholders' equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended January 31, 2019 , and the related notes and our report dated March 28, 2019 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon. Basis for Opinion The Companys management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Companys internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting A companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. /s/ Ernst  Young LLP  Rogers, Arkansas March 28, 2019 Walmart Inc.

Walmart Inc. Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements Note 1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies General Walmart Inc. (\"Walmart\" or the \"Company\") helps people around the world save money and live better  anytime and anywhere  by providing the opportunity to shop in retail stores and through eCommerce. Through innovation, the Company is striving to continuously improve a customer-centric experience that seamlessly integrates eCommerce and retail stores in an omni-channel offering that saves time for its customers. Each week, the Company serves over 275 million customers who visit its more than 11,300 stores and numerous eCommerce websites under 58 banners in 27 countries. The Company's operations comprise three reportable segments: Walmart U.S., Walmart International and Sam's Club. Principles of Consolidation The Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of Walmart and its subsidiaries as of and for the fiscal years ended January 31, 2019 (\"fiscal 2019 \"), January 31, 2018 (\"fiscal 2018 \") and January 31, 2017 (\"fiscal 2017 \"). Intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. The Company consolidates variable interest entities where it has been determined that the Company is the primary beneficiary of those entities' operations. Investments for which the Company exercises significant influence but does not have control are accounted for under the equity method. These variable interest entities and equity method investments are immaterial to the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements. The Company's Consolidated Financial Statements are based on a fiscal year ending on January 31 for the United States (\"U.S.\") and Canadian operations. The Company consolidates all other operations generally using a one-month lag and based on a calendar year. There were no significant intervening events during the month of January 2019 related to the operations consolidated using a lag that materially affected the Consolidated Financial Statements. Use of Estimates The Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Those principles require management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities. Management's estimates and assumptions also affect the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results may differ from those estimates. Cash and Cash Equivalents The Company considers investments with a maturity when purchased of three months or less to be cash equivalents. All credit card, debit card and electronic transfer transactions that process in less than seven days are classified as cash and cash equivalents. The amounts due from banks for these transactions classified as cash and cash equivalents totaled $1.4 billion and $1.6 billion as of January 31, 2019 and 2018 , respectively. The Company's cash balances are held in various locations around the world. Substantially all of the Company's $7.7 billion and $6.8 billion of cash and cash equivalents as of January 31, 2019 and January 31, 2018 were held outside of the U.S. Cash and cash equivalents held outside of the U.S. are generally utilized to support liquidity needs in the Company's non-U.S. operations. The Company uses intercompany financing arrangements in an effort to ensure cash can be made available in the country in which it is needed with the minimum cost possible. During fiscal 2019, the Company repatriated to the U.S. $5.3 billion of cash at a tax cost of approximately $40 million . As of January 31, 2019 and 2018 , cash and cash equivalents of approximately $2.8 billion and $1.4 billion , respectively, may not be freely transferable to the U.S. due to local laws or other restrictions. Of the $2.8 billion as of January 31, 2019 , approximately $1.2 billion can only be accessed through dividends or intercompany financing arrangements subject to approval of Flipkart Private Limited (\"Flipkart\") minority shareholders; however, this cash is expected to be utilized to fund the operations of Flipkart. Restricted Cash In November 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-18, Statement of Cash FlowsRestricted Cash (Topic 230) , which requires restricted cash to be included with cash and cash equivalents when reconciling the beginning and ending amounts on the statement of cash flows. The Company adopted this ASU on February 1, 2018. Restricted cash held outside of cash and cash equivalents was $34 million as of January 31, 2019 , primarily recorded in prepaid expenses and other in the Consolidated Balance Sheets, and $300 million as of January 31, 2018 , primarily recorded in other long-term assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Receivables Receivables are stated at their carrying values, net of a reserve for doubtful accounts, and are primarily due from the following: insurance companies resulting from pharmacy sales; banks for customer credit and debit cards and electronic bank transfers that take in excess of seven days to process; governments for income taxes; suppliers for marketing or incentive programs; and real estate transactions. Inventories The Company values inventories at the lower of cost or market as determined primarily by the retail inventory method of accounting, using the last-in, first-out (\"LIFO\") method for Walmart U.S. segment's inventories. The inventory at the Walmart International segment is valued primarily by the retail inventory method of accounting, using the first-in, first-out (\"FIFO\") method. The retail inventory method of accounting results in inventory being valued at the lower of cost or market, since permanent markdowns are immediately recorded as a reduction of the retail value of inventory. The inventory at the Sam's Club segment is valued using the weighted-average cost LIFO method. As of January 31, 2019 and January 31, 2018 , the Company's inventories valued at LIFO approximated those inventories as if they were valued at FIFO. Assets Held for Sale Assets held for sale represent components and businesses that meet accounting requirements to be classified as held for sale and are presented as single asset and liability amounts in the Company's financial statements with a valuation allowance, if necessary, to recognize the net carrying amount at the lower of cost or fair value, less costs to sell. The Company reviews all businesses and assets held for sale each reporting period to determine whether the existing carrying amounts are fully recoverable in comparison to estimated fair values. As of January 31, 2019 and January 31, 2018 , immaterial amounts for assets and liabilities held for sale were classified in prepaid expenses and other and accrued liabilities, respectively, in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Property and Equipment Property and equipment are initially recorded at cost. Gains or losses on disposition are recognized as earned or incurred. Costs of major improvements are capitalized, while costs of normal repairs and maintenance are expensed as incurred. The following table summarizes the Company's property and equipment balances and includes the estimated useful lives that are generally used to depreciate the assets on a straight-line basis: ##TABLE_START     As of January 31, (Amounts in millions)  Estimated Useful Lives   Land  N/A  $ 24,526  $ 25,298 Buildings and improvements  3-40 years  101,006  101,155 Fixtures and equipment  1-30 years  54,488  52,695 Transportation equipment  3-15 years  2,316  2,387 Construction in progress  N/A  3,474  3,619 Property and equipment    $ 185,810  $ 185,154 Accumulated depreciation    (81,493 )  (77,479 ) Property and equipment, net    $ 104,317  $ 107,675 ##TABLE_ENDLeasehold improvements are depreciated or amortized over the shorter of the estimated useful life of the asset or the remaining expected lease term. Total depreciation and amortization expense for property and equipment, property under financing obligations, property under capital leases and intangible assets for fiscal 2019 , 2018 and 2017 was $10.7 billion , $10.5 billion and $10.1 billion , respectively. Leases The Company leases land, buildings, fixtures and equipment and transportation equipment. The Company estimates the expected lease term by assuming the exercise of renewal options where an economic penalty exists that would preclude the abandonment of the lease at the end of the initial non-cancelable term and the exercise of such renewal is at the sole discretion of the Company. The expected lease term is used in the determination of whether a store or club lease is a capital or operating lease and in the calculation of straight-line rent expense. Additionally, the useful life of leasehold improvements is limited by the expected lease term or the economic life of the asset, whichever is shorter. If significant expenditures are made for leasehold improvements late in the expected lease term and renewal is reasonably assured, the useful life of the leasehold improvement is limited to the end of the renewal period or economic life of the asset, whichever is shorter. Rent abatements and escalations are considered in the calculation of minimum lease payments in the Company's capital lease tests and in determining straight-line rent expense for operating leases. The Company is often involved in the construction of its leased stores. In certain cases, payments made for certain structural components included in the lessor's construction of the leased assets result in the Company being deemed the owner of the leased assets for accounting purposes. As a result, the payments, regardless of the significance, are automatic indicators of ownership and require the Company to capitalize the lessor's total project cost with a corresponding financing obligation. Upon completion of the lessor's project, the Company performs a sale-leaseback analysis to determine if these assets and the related financing obligation can be derecognized from the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets. If the Company is deemed to have \"continuing involvement,\" the leased assets and the related financing obligation remain on the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets and are generally amortized over the lease term. At the end of the lease term, including exercise of any renewal options, the net remaining financing obligation over the net carrying value of the fixed asset will be recognized as a non-cash gain. Long-Lived Assets Long-lived assets are initially recorded at cost. Management reviews long-lived assets for indicators of impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. The evaluation is performed at the lowest level of identifiable cash flows, which is at the individual store or club level. Undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the related assets are estimated over the assets' useful lives based on updated projections. If the evaluation indicates that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable, any potential impairment is measured based upon the fair value of the related asset or asset group as determined by an appropriate market appraisal or other valuation technique. Goodwill and Other Acquired Intangible Assets Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of net assets acquired in business combinations and is allocated to the appropriate reporting unit when acquired. Other acquired intangible assets are stated at the fair value acquired as determined by a valuation technique commensurate with the intended use of the related asset. Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are not amortized; rather, they are evaluated for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the value of the asset may be impaired. Definite-lived intangible assets are considered long-lived assets and are amortized on a straight-line basis over the periods that expected economic benefits will be provided. Goodwill is assigned to the reporting unit which consolidates the acquisition. Components within the same reportable segment are aggregated and deemed a single reporting unit if the components have similar economic characteristics. As of January 31, 2019 , the Company's reporting units consisted of Walmart U.S., Walmart International and Sam's Club. Goodwill is evaluated for impairment using either a qualitative or quantitative approach for each of the Company's reporting units. Generally, a qualitative assessment is first performed to determine whether a quantitative goodwill impairment test is necessary. If management determines, after performing an assessment based on the qualitative factors, that the fair value of the reporting unit is more likely than not less than the carrying amount, or that a fair value of the reporting unit substantially in excess of the carrying amount cannot be assured, then a quantitative goodwill impairment test would be required. The quantitative test for goodwill impairment is performed by determining the fair value of the related reporting units. Fair value is measured based on the discounted cash flow method and relative market-based approaches. After evaluation, management determined the fair value of each reporting unit is greater than the carrying amount and, accordingly, the Company has not recorded any impairment charges related to goodwill. The following table reflects goodwill activity, by reportable segment, for fiscal 2019 and 2018 : ##TABLE_START (Amounts in millions)  Walmart U.S.  Walmart International  Sam's Club  Total Balances as of February 1, 2017  $ 2,236  $ 14,488  $  $ 17,037 Changes in currency translation and other       Acquisitions       Balances as of January 31, 2018  2,445  15,484   18,242 Changes in currency translation and other    (743 )    (743 ) Acquisitions (1)   13,575    13,682 Balances as of January 31, 2019  $ 2,552  $ 28,316  $  $ 31,181 ##TABLE_END(1)  Goodwill recorded in fiscal 2019 for Walmart International relates to Flipkart. Intangible assets are included in other long-term assets in the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets. These assets are evaluated for impairment based on their fair values using valuation techniques which are updated annually based on the most recent variables and assumptions. There were no significant impairment charges related to intangible assets for fiscal 2019 , 2018 and 2017 . Fair Value Measurement In January 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (\"FASB\") issued Accounting Standards Update (\"ASU\") 2016-01, Financial InstrumentsOverall (Topic 825) , which updated certain aspects of recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of financial instruments (\"ASU 2016-01\"). The Company adopted this ASU on February 1, 2018, which primarily impacted the Company's accounting for its investment in JD.com, Inc. (\"JD\") and resulted in a positive adjustment to retained earnings of approximately $2.6 billion , net of tax, based on the market value of the Company's investment in JD as of January 31, 2018. The adoption required prospective changes in fair value of the Company's investment in JD to be recorded in the Consolidated Statement of Income, which the Company classifies in other gains and losses. The Company records and discloses certain financial and non-financial assets and liabilities at fair value. The fair value of an asset is the price at which the asset could be sold in an orderly transaction between unrelated, knowledgeable and willing parties able to engage in the transaction. The fair value of a liability is the amount that would be paid to transfer the liability to a new obligor in a transaction between such parties, not the amount that would be paid to settle the liability with the creditor. Self Insurance Reserves The Company self-insures a number of risks, including, but not limited to, workers' compensation, general liability, auto liability, product liability and certain employee-related healthcare benefits . Standard actuarial procedures and data analysis are used to estimate the liabilities associated with these risks as of the balance sheet date on an undiscounted basis. The recorded liabilities reflect the ultimate cost for claims incurred but not paid and any estimable administrative run-out expenses related to the processing of these outstanding claim payments. On a regular basis, the liabilities are evaluated for appropriateness with claims reserve valuations. To limit exposure to some risks, the Company maintains insurance coverage with varying limits and retentions, including stop-loss insurance coverage for workers' compensation, general liability and auto liability. Derivatives The Company uses derivatives for hedging purposes to manage its exposure to changes in interest and currency exchange rates, as well as to maintain an appropriate mix of fixed- and variable-rate debt. Use of derivatives in hedging programs subjects the Company to certain risks, such as market and credit risks. Market risk represents the possibility that the value of the derivatives will change. In a hedging relationship, the change in the value of the derivative is offset to a great extent by the change in the value of the underlying hedged item. Credit risk related to a derivative represents the possibility that the counterparty will not fulfill the terms of the contract. Credit risk is monitored through established approval procedures, including setting concentration limits by counterparty, reviewing credit ratings and requiring collateral from the counterparty when appropriate. The Company only enters into derivatives with counterparties rated \"A-\" or better by nationally recognized credit rating agencies. Subsequent to entering into derivatives, the Company regularly monitors the credit ratings of its counterparties. The notional, or contractual, amount of the Company's derivatives is used to measure interest to be paid or received and does not represent the Company's exposure due to credit risk. The contractual terms of the Company's derivatives closely mirror those of the hedged items, providing a high degree of risk reduction and correlation. Contracts that are effective at meeting the risk reduction and correlation criteria are recorded using hedge accounting. If a derivative is recorded using hedge accounting, depending on the nature of the hedge, changes in fair value will either be offset against the change in fair value of the hedged assets, liabilities or firm commitments through earnings or be recognized in accumulated other comprehensive loss until the hedged item is recognized in earnings. Any hedge ineffectiveness is immediately recognized in earnings. The Company's net investment and cash flow hedges are highly effective and the ineffective portion has not been, and is not expected to be, significant. Derivatives that do not meet the criteria for hedge accounting, or contracts for which the Company has not elected hedge accounting, are recorded at fair value with unrealized gains or losses reported in earnings during the period of the change. Fair Value Hedges The Company is a party to receive fixed-rate, pay variable-rate interest rate swaps that the Company uses to hedge the fair value of fixed-rate debt. The notional amounts are used to measure interest to be paid or received and do not represent the Company's exposure due to credit loss. The Company's interest rate swaps that receive fixed-interest rate payments and pay variable-interest rate payments are designated as fair value hedges. As the specific terms and notional amounts of the derivatives match those of the fixed-rate debt being hedged, the derivatives are assumed to be perfectly effective hedges. Changes in the fair values of these derivatives are recorded in earnings, but are offset by corresponding changes in the fair values of the hedged items, also recorded in earnings, and, accordingly, do not impact the Company's Consolidated Statements of Income. These derivatives will mature on dates ranging from October 2020 to April 2024 . Net Investment Hedges The Company is a party to cross-currency interest rate swaps that the Company uses to hedge its net investments. The agreements are contracts to exchange fixed-rate payments in one currency for fixed-rate payments in another currency. All changes in the fair value of these derivatives are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss, offsetting the currency translation adjustment of the related investment that is also recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss. These derivatives will mature on dates ranging from July 2020 to February 2030 . The Company has issued foreign-currency-denominated long-term debt as hedges of net investments of certain of its foreign operations. These foreign-currency-denominated long-term debt issuances are designated and qualify as nonderivative hedging instruments. Accordingly, the foreign currency translation of these debt instruments is recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss, offsetting the foreign currency translation adjustment of the related net investment that is also recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss. Cash Flow Hedges The Company is a party to receive fixed-rate, pay fixed-rate cross-currency interest rate swaps to hedge the currency exposure associated with the forecasted payments of principal and interest of certain non-U.S. denominated debt. The swaps are designated as cash flow hedges of the currency risk related to payments on the non-U.S. denominated debt. The effective portion of changes in the fair value of derivatives designated as cash flow hedges of foreign exchange risk is recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss and is subsequently reclassified into earnings in the period that the hedged forecasted transaction affects earnings. The hedged items are recognized foreign currency-denominated liabilities that are re-measured at spot exchange rates each period, and the assessment of effectiveness (and measurement of any ineffectiveness) is based on total changes in the related derivative's cash flows. As a result, the amount reclassified into earnings each period includes an amount that offsets the related transaction gain or loss arising from that re-measurement and the adjustment to earnings for the period's allocable portion of the initial spot-forward difference associated with the hedging instrument. These derivatives will mature on dates ranging from April 2022 to March 2034 . Financial Statement Presentation Realized derivative gains and losses are recorded in interest, net, in the Company's Consolidated Statements of Income. Although subject to master netting arrangements, the Company does not offset derivative assets and liabilities in its Consolidated Balance Sheets. Derivatives with an unrealized gain are recorded in the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets as either current or non-current assets, based on maturity date, and derivatives with an unrealized loss are recorded as either current or non-current liabilities, based on maturity date. Refer to Note 7 for the net presentation of the Company's derivatives. Additionally, the Company records cash collateral received as amounts due to the counterparties exclusive of any derivative asset and records cash collateral it posts with counterparties as amounts receivable from those counterparties exclusive of any derivative liability. Income Taxes Income taxes are accounted for under the balance sheet method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases (\"temporary differences\"). Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rate is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. Deferred tax assets are evaluated for future realization and reduced by a valuation allowance to the extent that a portion is not more likely than not to be realized. Many factors are considered when assessing whether it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will be realized, including recent cumulative earnings, expectations of future taxable income, carryforward periods, and other relevant quantitative and qualitative factors. The recoverability of the deferred tax assets is evaluated by assessing the adequacy of future expected taxable income from all sources, including reversal of taxable temporary differences, forecasted operating earnings and available tax planning strategies. These sources of income rely heavily on estimates. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act contains a provision which subjects a US parent of a foreign subsidiary to current US tax on its global intangible lowtaxed income (GILTI). The GILTI income is eligible for a deduction, which lowers the effective tax rate to 10.5% for calendar years 2018 through 2025 and 13.125% after 2025. The Company will report the tax impact of GILTI as a period cost when incurred. Accordingly, the Company is not providing deferred taxes for basis differences expected to reverse as GILTI. In determining the provision for income taxes, an annual effective income tax rate is used based on annual income, permanent differences between book and tax income, and statutory income tax rates. Discrete events such as audit settlements or changes in tax laws are recognized in the period in which they occur. The Company records a liability for unrecognized tax benefits resulting from uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. The Company records interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in interest expense and operating, selling, general and administrative expenses, respectively, in the Company's Consolidated Statements of Income. Refer to Note 9 for additional income tax disclosures. In February 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-02, Income StatementReporting Comprehensive Income (Topic 220): Reclassification of Certain Tax Effects from Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (\"ASU 2018-02\"). This ASU provides that the stranded tax effects from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (\"Tax Act\") in accumulated other comprehensive loss may be reclassified to retained earnings. The Company adopted this ASU on February 1, 2018, which resulted in an immaterial negative adjustment to retained earnings. Revenue Recognition  In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) . This ASU is a comprehensive new revenue recognition model that requires a company to recognize revenue to depict the transfer of goods or services to a customer at an amount that reflects the consideration it expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services. The Company adopted this ASU on February 1, 2018, using the modified retrospective approach and applied this ASU only to contracts not completed as of February 1, 2018. The accounting policies and other disclosures are below as well as the disclosure of disaggregated revenues in Note 15 . The impact of adopting this ASU was not material to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Net Sales The Company recognizes sales revenue, net of sales taxes and estimated sales returns, at the time it sells merchandise to the customer. eCommerce sales include shipping revenue and are recorded upon delivery to the customer. Additionally, estimated sales returns are calculated based on expected returns. Membership Fee Revenue The Company recognizes membership fee revenue both in the U.S. and internationally over the term of the membership, which is typically 12 months. Membership fee revenue was $1.4 billion for each of fiscal 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Membership fee revenue is included in membership and other income in the Company's Consolidated Statements of Income. Deferred membership fee is included in accrued liabilities in the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets. Gift Cards Customer purchases of gift cards are not recognized as sales until the card is redeemed and the customer purchases merchandise using the gift card. Gift cards in the U.S. and some countries do not carry an expiration date; therefore, customers and members can redeem their gift cards for merchandise and services indefinitely. Gift cards in some countries where the Company does business have expiration dates. While gift cards are generally redeemed within 12 months, a certain number of gift cards, both with and without expiration dates, will not be fully redeemed. Management estimates unredeemed balances and recognizes revenue for these amounts in membership and other income in the Company's Consolidated Statements of Income over the expected redemption period. Management periodically reviews and updates its estimates. Financial and Other Services The Company recognizes revenue from service transactions at the time the service is performed. Generally, revenue from services is classified as a component of net sales in the Company's Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income. Contract Balances Contract balances as a result of transactions with customers primarily consist of receivables included in receivables, net, and deferred gift card revenue included in accrued liabilities in the Company's Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. The following table provides the Company's receivables and deferred gift card revenue from transactions with customers: ##TABLE_START (Amounts in millions)  As of January 31, 2019 Assets:   Receivables from transactions with customers, net  $ 2,538    Liabilities:   Deferred gift card revenue  $ 1,932 ##TABLE_ENDCost of Sales Cost of sales includes actual product cost, the cost of transportation to the Company's distribution facilities, stores and clubs from suppliers, the cost of transportation from the Company's distribution facilities to the stores, clubs and customers and the cost of warehousing for the Sam's Club segment and import distribution centers. Cost of sales is reduced by supplier payments that are not a reimbursement of specific, incremental and identifiable costs. Payments from Suppliers The Company receives consideration from suppliers for various programs, primarily volume incentives, warehouse allowances and reimbursements for specific programs such as markdowns, margin protection, advertising and supplier-specific fixtures. Payments from suppliers are accounted for as a reduction of cost of sales, except in certain limited situations when the payment is a reimbursement of specific, incremental and identifiable costs, and are recognized in the Company's Consolidated Statements of Income when the related inventory is sold. Operating, Selling, General and Administrative Expenses Operating, selling, general and administrative expenses include all operating costs of the Company, except cost of sales, as described above. As a result, the majority of the cost of warehousing and occupancy for the Walmart U.S. and Walmart International segments' distribution facilities is included in operating, selling, general and administrative expenses. Because the Company only includes a portion of the cost of its Walmart U.S. and Walmart International segments' distribution facilities in cost of sales, its gross profit and gross profit as a percentage of net sales may not be comparable to those of other retailers that may include all costs related to their distribution facilities in cost of sales and in the calculation of gross profit. Advertising Costs Advertising costs are expensed as incurred, consist primarily of print, television and digital advertisements and are recorded in operating, selling, general and administrative expenses in the Company's Consolidated Statements of Income. In certain limited situations, reimbursements from suppliers that are for specific, incremental and identifiable advertising costs are recognized as a reduction of advertising costs in operating, selling, general and administrative expenses. Advertising costs were $3.5 billion , $3.1 billion and $2.9 billion for fiscal 2019 , 2018 and 2017 , respectively. Currency Translation The assets and liabilities of all international subsidiaries are translated from the respective local currency to the U.S. dollar using exchange rates at the balance sheet date. Related translation adjustments are recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss. The Company's Consolidated Statements of Income of all international subsidiaries are translated from the respective local currencies to the U.S. dollar using average exchange rates for the period covered by the income statements. Recent Accounting Pronouncements Leases In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842) , which requires lease assets and liabilities to be recorded on the balance sheet. Certain qualitative and quantitative disclosures are also required. The Company will adopt this ASU and related amendments as of the beginning of the first quarter of the year ending January 31, 2020 (\"fiscal 2020\") and will be electing certain practical expedients permitted under the transition guidance, including to retain the historical lease classification as well as relief from reviewing expired or existing contracts to determine if they contain leases. The Company will be exempting leases with an initial term of twelve months or less from balance sheet recognition and, for most classes of assets, the Company will be combining non-lease components with lease components. Management has implemented and continues to implement new lease systems in connection with the adoption. The adoption of this ASU and related amendments will result in total assets and liabilities increasing approximately $15 billion , which is primarily due to recognizing approximately $17.5 billion of operating lease assets and liabilities, partially offset by derecognizing approximately $3 billion of assets and liabilities related to financial obligations connected with the construction of leased stores. Several other line items in the Companys Consolidated Balance Sheet will also be impacted by immaterial amounts. The Companys Consolidated Statements of Income and Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows will not be materially impacted. Finally, management expects the first quarter fiscal 2020 disclosure of future operating commitments to significantly increase compared to the aggregate minimum rentals disclosed in Note 11 , primarily because the new standard requires reasonably assured renewals be included. Financial Instruments In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13, Financial InstrumentsCredit Losses (Topic 326) , which modifies the measurement of expected credit losses of certain financial instruments. The Company will adopt this ASU on February 1, 2020. Management is currently evaluating this ASU to determine its impact to the Company's consolidated financial statements. Note 2. Net Income Per Common Share Basic net income per common share attributable to Walmart is based on the weighted-average common shares outstanding during the relevant period. Diluted net income per common share attributable to Walmart is based on the weighted-average common shares outstanding during the relevant period adjusted for the dilutive effect of share-based awards. The Company did not have significant share-based awards outstanding that were antidilutive and not included in the calculation of diluted net income per common share attributable to Walmart for fiscal 2019 , 2018 and 2017 . The following table provides a reconciliation of the numerators and denominators used to determine basic and diluted net income per common share attributable to Walmart: ##TABLE_START   Fiscal Years Ended January 31, (Amounts in millions, except per share data)    Numerator       Consolidated net income  $ 7,179  $ 10,523  $ 14,293 Consolidated net income attributable to noncontrolling interest  (509 )  (661 )  (650 ) Consolidated net income attributable to Walmart  $ 6,670  $ 9,862  $ 13,643        Denominator       Weighted-average common shares outstanding, basic  2,929  2,995  3,101 Dilutive impact of stock options and other share-based awards    Weighted-average common shares outstanding, diluted  2,945  3,010  3,112       Net income per common share attributable to Walmart       Basic  $ 2.28  $ 3.29  $ 4.40 Diluted  2.26  3.28  4.38 ##TABLE_ENDNote 3. Shareholders' Equity The total authorized shares of $0.10 par value common stock is 11.0 billion , of which 2.9 billion and 3.0 billion were issued and outstanding as of January 31, 2019 and 2018 , respectively. Share-Based Compensation The Company has awarded share-based compensation to associates and nonemployee directors of the Company. The compensation expense recognized for all stock incentive plans, including expense associated with plans of the Company's consolidated subsidiaries granted in the subsidiaries' respective stock, was $773 million , $626 million and $596 million for fiscal 2019 , 2018 and 2017 , respectively. Share-based compensation expense is generally included in operating, selling, general and administrative expenses in the Company's Consolidated Statements of Income. The total income tax benefit recognized for share-based compensation was $181 million , $150 million and $212 million for fiscal 2019 , 2018 and 2017 , respectively. The following table summarizes the Company's share-based compensation expense by award type for all plans: ##TABLE_START  Fiscal Years Ended January 31, (Amounts in millions)   Restricted stock and performance share units $  $  $ Restricted stock units   Other   Share-based compensation expense $  $  $ ##TABLE_ENDThe Walmart Inc. Stock Incentive Plan of 2015 (the \"Plan\"), as amended and restated effective February 23, 2016, as amended further as of February 1, 2017, and as renamed on February 1, 2018, was established to grant stock options, restricted (non-vested) stock, performance share units and other equity compensation awards for which 260 million shares of Walmart common stock issued or to be issued under the Plan have been registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. The Company believes that such awards serve to align the interests of its associates with those of its shareholders. The Plan's award types are summarized as follows: ##TABLE_START  Restricted Stock and Performance Share Units. Restricted stock awards are for shares that vest based on the passage of time and include restrictions related to employment. Performance share units vest based on the passage of time and achievement of performance criteria and may range from 0% to 150% of the original award amount. Vesting periods for these awards are generally between one and three years. Restricted stock and performance share units may be settled or deferred in stock and are accounted for as equity in the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets. The fair value of restricted stock awards is determined on the date of grant and is expensed ratably over the vesting period. The fair value of performance share units is determined on the date of grant using the Company's stock price discounted for the expected dividend yield through the vesting period and is recognized over the vesting period. The weighted-average discount for the dividend yield used to determine the fair value of performance share units in fiscal 2019 , 2018 and 2017 was 6.2% , 7.2% and 8.3% , respectively. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Restricted Stock Units. Restricted stock units provide rights to Company stock after a specified service period; generally 50% vest three years from the grant date and the remaining 50% vest five years from the grant date. The fair value of each restricted stock unit is determined on the date of grant using the stock price discounted for the expected dividend yield through the vesting period and is recognized ratably over the vesting period. The expected dividend yield is based on the anticipated dividends over the vesting period. The weighted-average discount for the dividend yield used to determine the fair value of restricted stock units granted in fiscal 2019 , 2018 and 2017 was 7.2% , 9.0% and 9.0% , respectively. ##TABLE_END In addition to the Plan, the Company's United Kingdom subsidiary has stock option plans for certain colleagues which generally vest over three years. The stock option share-based compensation expense is included in the Other line in the table above. Flipkart also maintains a stock option plan primarily for the benefit of employees and nonemployee directors under which options to acquire Flipkart common shares may be issued. The grants have no exercise price and no compensation expense was recognized during fiscal 2019 due to a liquidity event performance condition that was not deemed probable of occurrence. The following table shows the activity for restricted stock and performance share units and restricted stock units during fiscal 2019 : ##TABLE_START   Restricted Stock and Performance Share Units (1)  Restricted Stock Units (Shares in thousands)  Shares  Weighted-Average Grant-Date Fair Value Per Share  Shares  Weighted-Average Grant-Date Fair Value Per Share Outstanding as of February 1, 2018  8,558  $ 70.47  24,153  $ 66.69 Granted  3,600  84.94  7,946  80.94 Vested/exercised  (2,448 )  74.67  (5,524 )  69.52 Forfeited  (911 )  68.24  (2,620 )  69.74 Outstanding as of January 31, 2019  8,799  $ 75.39  23,955  $ 70.47 ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (1) Assumes payout rate at 100% for Performance Share Units. ##TABLE_END The following table includes additional information related to restricted stock and performance share units and restricted stock units:  ##TABLE_START  Fiscal Years Ended January 31, (Amounts in millions, except years)   Fair value of restricted stock and performance share units vested $  $  $ Fair value of restricted stock units vested   Unrecognized compensation cost for restricted stock and performance share units   Unrecognized compensation cost for restricted stock units 1,002   Weighted average remaining period to expense for restricted stock and performance share units (years) 1.1  1.2  1.3 Weighted average remaining period to expense for restricted stock units (years) 1.6  1.8  1.9 ##TABLE_ENDShare Repurchase Program From time to time, the Company repurchases shares of its common stock under share repurchase programs authorized by the Company's Board of Directors. All repurchases made during fiscal year 2019  were made under the current  $20.0 billion  share repurchase program approved in October 2017, which has no expiration date or other restrictions limiting the period over which the Company can make share repurchases. As of January 31, 2019 , authorization for $11.3 billion  of share repurchases remained under the share repurchase program. Any repurchased shares are constructively retired and returned to an unissued status. The Company regularly reviews share repurchase activity and considers several factors in determining when to execute share repurchases, including, among other things, current cash needs, capacity for leverage, cost of borrowings, results of operations and the market price of the Company's common stock. The following table provides, on a settlement date basis, the number of shares repurchased, average price paid per share and total amount paid for share repurchases for fiscal 2019 , 2018 and 2017 : ##TABLE_START   Fiscal Years Ended January 31, (Amounts in millions, except per share data)    Total number of shares repurchased  79.5  104.9  119.9 Average price paid per share  $ 93.18  $ 79.11  $ 69.18 Total cash paid for share repurchases  $ 7,410  $ 8,296  $ 8,298 ##TABLE_ENDNote 4.

Short-term Borrowings and Long-term Debt Short-term borrowings consist of commercial paper and lines of credit. Short-term borrowings as of January 31, 2019 and 2018 were $5.2 billion and $5.3 billion , respectively, with weighted-average interest rates of 2.7% and 1.5% , respectively. The Company has various committed lines of credit in the U.S., committed with 22 financial institutions, totaling $15.0 billion and $12.5 billion as of January 31, 2019 and 2018 , respectively. These committed lines of credit are summarized in the following table: ##TABLE_START   January 31, 2019  January 31, 2018 (Amounts in millions)  Available  Drawn  Undrawn  Available  Drawn  Undrawn Five-year credit facility (1)  $ 5,000  $   $ 5,000  $ 5,000  $   $ 5,000 364-day revolving credit facility (1)  10,000    10,000  7,500    7,500 Total  $ 15,000  $   $ 15,000  $ 12,500  $   $ 12,500 ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (1) In May 2018, the Company renewed and extended its existing five-year credit facility and its existing 364-day revolving credit facility, both of which are used to support its commercial paper program. ##TABLE_END The committed lines of credit in the table above mature at various times between May 2019 and May 2023 , carry interest rates generally ranging between LIBOR plus 10 basis points and LIBOR plus 75 basis points, and incur commitment fees ranging between 1.5 and 4.0 basis points. In conjunction with the committed lines of credit listed in the table above, the Company has agreed to observe certain covenants, the most restrictive of which relates to the maximum amount of secured debt. Additionally, the Company also maintains other committed lines of credit outside of the U.S., with available amounts of approximately $3.0 billion and $4.0 billion as of January 31, 2019 and 2018 , respectively, of which approximately $0.2 billion and no amount was drawn as of January 31, 2019 and 2018 , respectively. Apart from the committed lines of credit, the Company has syndicated and fronted letters of credit available totaling $1.8 billion as of January 31, 2019 and 2018 , of which $1.6 billion and $1.5 billion was drawn as of January 31, 2019 and 2018 , respectively. The Company also has trade letters of credit, without stated limits, of which $0.4 billion was drawn as of January 31, 2019 and 2018 .

Interest costs are also impacted by certain derivatives described in Note 8 . ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (2) Includes deferred loan costs, discounts, fair value hedges, foreign-held debt and secured debt. As of January 31, 2019 and 2018 the Company had secured debt in the amount of $8 million and $10 million , respectively, which was collateralized by property that had an aggregate carrying amount of $82 million and $101 million , respectively. ##TABLE_END As of January 31, 2018 , the Company had $500 million in debt with embedded put options. These bonds matured in June 2018, and were fully repaid. The issuance of money market puttable reset securities in the amount of $500 million is structured to be remarketed in connection with the annual reset of the interest rate. If, for any reason, the remarketing of the notes does not occur at the time of any interest rate reset, the holders of the notes must sell and the Company must repurchase the notes at par. Accordingly as of January 31, 2018 , this issuance was classified as long-term debt due within one year in the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets.

In fiscal 2018, in connection with extinguishing debt, the Company paid premiums of approximately $3.1 billion which resulted in a loss on extinguishment of debt of approximately $3.1 billion . Note 7. Fair Value Measurements Assets and liabilities recorded at fair value are measured using the fair value hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value. The levels of the fair value hierarchy are: ##TABLE_START  Level 1: observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Level 2: inputs other than quoted prices in active markets that are either directly or indirectly observable; and ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Level 3: unobservable inputs for which little or no market data exists, therefore requiring the Company to develop its own assumptions. ##TABLE_END The Company measures the fair value of equity investments (primarily its investment in JD) on a recurring basis and records them in other long-term assets in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets. Measurement details about the Company's two portions of the investment in JD are as follows: ##TABLE_START  The purchased portion of the investment in JD measured using Level 1 inputs, which prior to fiscal 2019 was classified as available-for-sale with changes in fair value recognized through other comprehensive income; and ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  The portion of the investment in JD received in exchange for selling certain assets related to Yihaodian, the Company's former eCommerce operation in China, measured using Level 2 inputs. Fair value is determined primarily using quoted prices in active markets for similar assets. Prior to fiscal 2019, the investment was carried at cost. ##TABLE_END Information for the cost basis, carrying value and fair value of the Company's investment in JD is as follows: ##TABLE_START (Amounts in millions)  Cost Basis  Carrying Value as of January 31, 2018  Fair Value as of February 1, 2018   Fair Value as of January 31, 2019  Investment in JD measured using Level 1 inputs  $ 1,901  $ 3,547  $ 3,547 (1)   $ 1,791  Investment in JD measured using Level 2 inputs  1,490  1,490  3,559 (2)   1,792  Total  $ 3,391  $ 5,037  $ 7,106   $ 3,583 (3)  ##TABLE_END(1) Fair value was already recognized on the balance sheet. Upon adoption of the new financial instrument standard on February 1, 2018, the excess of fair value over cost was reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive loss to retained earnings. (2) Upon adoption of the new financial instrument standard on February 1, 2018, the excess of fair value over cost was recognized by increasing the carrying value of the asset and retained earnings. (3) The decreases in fair value from February 1, 2018 to January 31, 2019 of $ 3.5 billion was recognized in net income and included in other gains and losses in the Company's Consolidated Statements of Income. The Company also has derivatives. Derivative fair values are the estimated amounts the Company would receive or pay upon termination of the related derivative agreements as of the reporting dates. The fair values have been measured using the income approach and Level 2 inputs, which include the relevant interest rate and foreign currency forward curves. As of January 31, 2019 and January 31, 2018 , the notional amounts and fair values of these derivatives were as follows: ##TABLE_START  January 31, 2019  January 31, 2018 (Amounts in millions) Notional Amount  Fair Value  Notional Amount  Fair Value Receive fixed-rate, pay variable-rate interest rate swaps designated as fair value hedges $ 4,000  $ (78 )  $ 4,000  $ (91 ) Receive fixed-rate, pay fixed-rate cross-currency swaps designated as net investment hedges 2,250   2,250  Receive fixed-rate, pay fixed-rate cross-currency swaps designated as cash flow hedges 4,173  (272 )  4,523  Total $ 10,423  $ (16 )  $ 10,773  $ ##TABLE_ENDNonrecurring Fair Value Measurements In addition to assets and liabilities that are recorded at fair value on a recurring basis, the Company's assets and liabilities are also subject to nonrecurring fair value measurements. Generally, assets are recorded at fair value on a nonrecurring basis as a result of impairment charges. As discussed in Note 13 , the Company sold the majority stake in Walmart Brazil during fiscal 2019. The assets of the disposal group totaled $3.3 billion and were comprised of $1.0 billion in current assets, $1.6 billion in property and equipment and property under capital lease and financing obligations, net, and $0.7 billion of other long-term assets. When measured as held for sale, these assets were fully impaired as the carrying value of the disposal group exceeded the fair value, less costs to sell and contributed to a pre-tax net loss of $4.8 billion in the Walmart International segment, which was recorded in other gains and losses in the Company's Consolidated Statement of Income. Other impairment charges to assets measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis during fiscal 2019 were immaterial. For the fiscal year ended January 31, 2018 , the Company recorded impairment charges related to assets measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis of approximately $1.4 billion primarily related to the following: ##TABLE_START  in the Sam's Club segment as discussed in Note 14 , $0.6 billion for restructuring charges for closures of underperforming clubs; the impaired assets consisted primarily of buildings and related store fixtures, and leased assets of its retail operations; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  in the Walmart International segment as discussed in Note 14 , $0.2 billion for restructuring charges for the wind-down of the Brazil first-party eCommerce business; the impaired assets consisted primarily of fixtures and equipment; and ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  immaterial discontinued real estate projects in the Walmart U.S. and Sam's Club segments and decisions to exit certain international properties in the Walmart International segment. ##TABLE_END These impairment charges were classified in operating, selling, general and administrative expenses in the Company's Consolidated Statements of Income. The fair value was determined based on comparable market values of similar properties or on a rental income approach, using Level 2 inputs. Impairment charges not related to restructuring or decisions to exit properties for fiscal 2018 were not material. Other Fair Value Disclosures The Company records cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash and short-term borrowings at cost. The carrying values of these instruments approximate their fair value due to their short-term maturities. The Company's long-term debt is also recorded at cost. The fair value is estimated using Level 2 inputs based on the Company's current incremental borrowing rate for similar types of borrowing arrangements. The carrying value and fair value of the Company's long-term debt as of January 31, 2019 and 2018 , are as follows: ##TABLE_START   January 31, 2019  January 31, 2018 (Amounts in millions)  Carrying Value  Fair Value  Carrying Value  Fair Value Long-term debt, including amounts due within one year  $ 45,396  $ 49,570  $ 33,783  $ 38,766 ##TABLE_ENDNote 8. Derivatives In connection with various derivative agreements, including master netting arrangements, the Company held cash collateral from counterparties of $220 million and $279 million as of January 31, 2019 and January 31, 2018 , respectively. Furthermore, as part of the master netting arrangements with each of these counterparties, the Company is also required to post collateral with a counterparty if the Company's net derivative liability position exceeds $150 million with such counterparties. The Company did not have any cash collateral posted with counterparties as of January 31, 2019 and January 31, 2018 , respectively. As of January 31, 2019 and January 31, 2018 , the Company had 180 billion of outstanding long-term debt designated as a hedge of its net investment in Japan, as well as outstanding long-term debt of 1.7 billion as of January 31, 2019 and January 31, 2018 that was designated as a hedge of its net investment in the United Kingdom. These nonderivative net investment hedges will mature on dates ranging from July 2020 to January 2039 . The Company's derivatives, as well as its nonderivative debt instruments designated and qualifying as net investment hedges, were classified as follows as of January 31, 2019 and 2018 in the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets: ##TABLE_START  January 31, 2019  January 31, 2018 (Amounts in millions) Fair Value Hedges  Net Investment Hedges  Cash Flow Hedges  Fair Value Hedges  Net Investment Hedges  Cash Flow Hedges Derivatives            Derivative assets:            Other long-term assets $   $  $  $   $  $             Derivative liabilities:            Deferred income taxes and other                    Nonderivative hedging instruments            Long-term debt   3,863      4,041   ##TABLE_ENDAmounts related to the Company's derivatives expected to be reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive loss to net income during the next 12 months are not significant. Note 9. Taxes The components of income before income taxes are as follows: ##TABLE_START  Fiscal Years Ended January 31, (Amounts in millions)   U.S. 15,875  10,722  15,680 Non-U.S. (4,415 )  4,401  4,817 Total income before income taxes 11,460  15,123  20,497 ##TABLE_ENDA summary of the provision for income taxes is as follows: ##TABLE_START  Fiscal Years Ended January 31, (Amounts in millions)   Current:      U.S. federal $ 2,763  $ 2,998  $ 3,454 U.S. state and local   International 1,495  1,377  1,510 Total current tax provision 4,751  4,780  5,459 Deferred:      U.S. federal (361 )  (22 )  1,054 U.S. state and local (16 )  (12 )  International (93 )  (146 )  (360 ) Total deferred tax expense (benefit) (470 )  (180 )  Total provision for income taxes $ 4,281  $ 4,600  $ 6,204 ##TABLE_ENDIn December 2017, the Tax Act was enacted and significantly changed U.S. income tax law. Beginning January 2018, the Tax Act reduced the U.S. statutory tax rate and created new taxes focused on foreign-sourced earnings and related-party payments, including the creation of the base erosion anti-abuse tax and a new tax on global intangible low-taxed income (\"GILTI\"). In addition, the Company was subject to a one-time transition tax in fiscal 2018 on accumulated foreign subsidiary earnings not previously subject to U.S. income tax. The SEC staff issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118, Income Tax Accounting Implications of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (\"SAB 118\"), which allowed companies to record provisional amounts during a measurement period not to extend beyond one year of the enactment date. Due to the timing of the enactment and the complexity involved in applying the provisions of the Tax Act, the Company made reasonable estimates of the effects and recorded provisional amounts in its financial statements as of January 31, 2018, in accordance with SAB 118. The Company elected to apply the measurement period provisions of this guidance to certain income tax effects of the Tax Act when it became effective. The provisional measurement period ended in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019. While management believes the Company's accounting for Tax Reform is complete, it is based on prevailing regulations and currently available information, and any additional guidance issued by the IRS could impact the aforementioned amounts in future periods. The net tax benefit recognized in fiscal 2018 related to the Tax Act was $207 million , and in fiscal 2019, the Company recorded $442 million of additional tax expense related to the Tax Act, included as a component of provision for income taxes . One-time Transition Tax The Tax Act required the Company to pay U.S. income taxes on accumulated foreign subsidiary earnings not previously subject to U.S. income tax at a rate of 15.5% to the extent of foreign cash and certain other net current assets, as defined by the Tax Act, and 8.0% on the remaining earnings. In fiscal 2018, the Company recorded a provisional amount of $1.9 billion of additional income tax expense for its one-time transitional tax liability. The Company finalized the calculations of the Transition Tax liability and increased the provisional amount by $413 million , with the increase included as a component of provision for income taxes in fiscal 2019. Deferred Tax Effects The Tax Act reduced the U.S. statutory tax rate from 35.0% to 21.0% , beginning January 2018. Accordingly, the Company re-measured its deferred taxes as of January 31, 2018, to reflect the reduced rate that will apply in future periods when these deferred taxes are settled or realized. In fiscal 2018, the Company recognized a deferred tax benefit of $2.1 billion to reflect the reduced U.S. tax rate and other effects of the Tax Act. In fiscal 2018, the Company made no provisional adjustment with respect to the GILTI provision of the Tax Act. Upon finalizing the provisional accounting for the remeasurement of U.S. deferred tax assets and liabilities in fiscal 2019, the Company recorded an additional tax benefit of $75 million , which is included as a component of provision for income taxes. Effective Income Tax Rate Reconciliation In the past, the Company's effective income tax rate was typically lower than the U.S. statutory tax rate primarily because of benefits from lowertaxed global operations, including the use of global funding structures and certain U.S. tax credits as further discussed in the \"Cash and Cash Equivalents\" section of Note 1 . However, beginning January 2018, the US statutory rate of 21.0% generally falls below statutory rates in international jurisdictions. A reconciliation of the significant differences between the U.S. statutory tax rate and the effective income tax rate on pretax income from continuing operations is as follows: ##TABLE_START  Fiscal Years Ended January 31,    U.S. statutory tax rate 21.0 %  33.8 %  35.0 % U.S. state income taxes, net of federal income tax benefit 3.3 %  1.8 %  1.7 % Impact of the Tax Act:   One-time transition tax 3.6 %  12.3 %   % Deferred tax effects (0.7 )%  (14.1 )%   % Income taxed outside the U.S. (3.5 )%  (6.3 )%  (4.5 )% Disposition of Walmart Brazil 6.7 %   %   % Valuation allowance 6.4 %  2.1 %   % Net impact of repatriated international earnings 0.8 %  (0.1 )%  (1.0 )% Federal tax credits (1.2 )%  (0.9 )%  (0.6 )% Other, net 1.0 %  1.8 %  (0.3 )% Effective income tax rate 37.4 %  30.4 %  30.3 % ##TABLE_ENDDeferred Taxes The significant components of the Company's deferred tax account balances are as follows: ##TABLE_START   January 31, (Amounts in millions)   Deferred tax assets:     Loss and tax credit carryforwards  $ 2,964  $ 1,989 Accrued liabilities  2,135  2,482 Share-based compensation   Other  1,131  1,251 Total deferred tax assets  6,475  5,939 Valuation allowances  (2,448 )  (1,843 ) Deferred tax assets, net of valuation allowances  4,027  4,096 Deferred tax liabilities:     Property and equipment  4,175  3,954 Acquired intangibles  2,099  Inventory  1,354  1,153 Other   Total deferred tax liabilities  8,527  6,048 Net deferred tax liabilities  $ 4,500  $ 1,952 ##TABLE_ENDThe deferred taxes noted above are classified as follows in the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets: ##TABLE_START   January 31, (Amounts in millions)   Balance Sheet classification     Assets:     Other long-term assets  $ 1,796  $ 1,879    Liabilities:   Deferred income taxes and other  6,296  3,831    Net deferred tax liabilities  $ 4,500  $ 1,952 ##TABLE_ENDUnremitted Earnings Prior to the Tax Act, the Company asserted that all unremitted earnings of its foreign subsidiaries were considered indefinitely reinvested. As a result of the Tax Act, the Company reported and paid U.S. tax on the majority of its previously unremitted foreign earnings. During fiscal 2019, the Company repatriated to the U.S. $5.3 billion of cash relating to fiscal 2019 and prior earnings at a tax cost of approximately $40 million . As of January 31, 2019, the Company has not recorded approximately $ 3 billion of deferred tax liabilities associated with remaining unremitted foreign earnings considered indefinitely reinvested, for which U.S. and foreign income and withholding taxes would be due upon repatriation. Net Operating Losses, Tax Credit Carryforwards and Valuation Allowances As of January 31, 2019 , the Company had net operating loss and capital loss carryforwards totaling $12.2 billion . Of these carryforwards, $8.0 billion will expire, if not utilized, in various years through 2039 . The remaining carryforwards have no expiration. As of January 31, 2019 , the Company's transition tax calculation fully utilized all foreign tax credit carryforwards. The recoverability of these future tax deductions and credits is evaluated by assessing the adequacy of future expected taxable income from all sources, including taxable income in prior carryback years, reversal of taxable temporary differences, forecasted operating earnings and available tax planning strategies. To the extent the Company does not consider it more likely than not that a deferred tax asset will be recovered, a valuation allowance is established. To the extent that a valuation allowance has been established and it is subsequently determined that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will be recovered, the valuation allowance will be released. The Company had valuation allowances of $2.4 billion and $1.8 billion as of January 31, 2019 and 2018 , respectively, on deferred tax assets associated primarily with net operating loss carryforwards for which management has determined it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will not be realized. Net activity in the valuation allowance during fiscal 2019 related to the acquisition of Flipkart and disposal of Walmart Brazil, changes in judgment regarding the future realization of deferred tax assets, releases arising from the use of deferred tax assets and decreases due to operating loss expirations and fluctuations in currency exchange rates. Management believes that it is more likely than not that the remaining deferred tax assets will be fully realized. Uncertain Tax Positions The benefits of uncertain tax positions are recorded in the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements only after determining a more-likely-than-not probability that the uncertain tax positions will withstand challenge, if any, from taxing authorities. As of January 31, 2019 and 2018 , the amount of unrecognized tax benefits related to continuing operations was $1.3 billion and $1.0 billion , respectively. The amount of unrecognized tax benefits that would affect the Company's effective income tax rate was $1.1 billion and $690 million as of January 31, 2019 and 2018 , respectively. A reconciliation of unrecognized tax benefits from continuing operations is as follows: ##TABLE_START  Fiscal Years Ended January 31, (Amounts in millions)   Unrecognized tax benefits, beginning of year $ 1,010  $ 1,050  $ Increases related to prior year tax positions   Decreases related to prior year tax positions (107 )  (254 )  (32 ) Increases related to current year tax positions   Settlements during the period (390 )  (23 )  (46 ) Lapse in statutes of limitations (31 )  (15 )  (12 ) Unrecognized tax benefits, end of year $ 1,305  $ 1,010  $ 1,050 ##TABLE_ENDInterest expense and penalties related to these positions were immaterial for fiscal 2019 , 2018 and 2017 . During the next twelve months, it is reasonably possible that tax audit resolutions could reduce unrecognized tax benefits by an immaterial amount, either because the tax positions are sustained on audit or because the Company agrees to their disallowance. The Company is focused on resolving tax audits as expeditiously as possible. As a result of these efforts, unrecognized tax benefits could potentially be reduced beyond the provided range during the next twelve months. The Company does not expect any change to have a material impact to its Consolidated Financial Statements. The Company remains subject to income tax examinations for its U.S. federal income taxes generally for fiscal 2014 through 2019 . The Company also remains subject to income tax examinations for international income taxes for fiscal 2012 through 2019 , and for U.S. state and local income taxes generally for the fiscal years ended 2013 through 2019 . Other Taxes The Company is subject to tax examinations for value added, sales-based, payroll and other non-income taxes. A number of these examinations are ongoing in various jurisdictions. In certain cases, the Company has received assessments from the respective taxing authorities in connection with these examinations. Unless otherwise indicated, the possible losses or range of possible losses associated with these matters are individually immaterial, but a group of related matters, if decided adversely to the Company, could result in a liability material to the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements. Note 10. Contingencies Legal Proceedings The Company is involved in a number of legal proceedings. The Company has made accruals with respect to these matters, where appropriate, which are reflected in the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements. For some matters, a liability is not probable or the amount cannot be reasonably estimated and therefore an accrual has not been made. However, where a liability is reasonably possible and may be material, such matters have been disclosed. The Company may enter into discussions regarding settlement of these matters, and may enter into settlement agreements, if it believes settlement is in the best interest of the Company and its shareholders. Unless stated otherwise, the matters discussed below, if decided adversely to or settled by the Company, individually or in the aggregate, may result in a liability material to the Company's financial condition or results of operations. ASDA Equal Value Claims ASDA Stores, Ltd. (\"Asda\"), a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, is a defendant in nearly 30,000 \"equal value\" claims that are proceeding before an Employment Tribunal in Manchester (the \"Employment Tribunal\") in the United Kingdom (\"UK\") on behalf of current and former Asda store employees, and further claims may be asserted in the future. The claimants allege that the work performed by female employees in Asda's retail stores is of equal value in terms of, among other things, the demands of their jobs compared to that of male employees working in Asda's warehouse and distribution facilities, and that the disparity in pay between these different job positions is not objectively justified. As a result, claimants are requesting differential back pay based on higher wage rates in the warehouse and distribution facilities and higher wage rates on a prospective basis. On March 23, 2015, Asda asked the Employment Tribunal to stay all proceedings and to \"strike out\" substantially all of the claims because the claimants had not adhered to the Tribunal's procedural rule for including multiple claimants on the same claim form. On July 23, 2015, the Employment Tribunal denied Asda's requests. Following additional proceedings, on June 20, 2017, the Employment Appeal Tribunal ruled in favor of Asda on the \"strike out\" issue and remitted the matter to the Employment Tribunal to determine whether the improperly filed claims should be struck out. On July 12, 2017, claimants sought permission from the Court of Appeals to appeal this ruling, which was granted on October 3, 2017. A hearing before the Court of Appeals on the \"strike out\" issue was held on October 23, 2018. On January 17, 2019, the Court of Appeals declined to strike out any claims relying on the Employment Tribunals finding that claimants had not deliberately disregarded the Tribunals procedural rule. As to the initial phase of the Equal Value claims, on October 14, 2016, following a preliminary hearing, the Employment Tribunal ruled that claimants could compare their positions in Asda's retail stores with those of employees in Asda's warehouse and distribution facilities. On August 31, 2017, the Employment Appeal Tribunal affirmed the Employment Tribunal's ruling and also granted permission for Asda to appeal substantially all of its findings. Asda sought permission to appeal the remainder of the Employment Appeal Tribunal's findings to the Court of Appeals. A hearing before the Court of Appeals on the comparability findings was held on October 10, 2018 and the Court of Appeals upheld the Employment Tribunals findings. Claimants are now proceeding in the next phase of their claims. That phase will determine whether the work performed by the claimants is of equal value to the work performed by employees in Asda's warehouse and distribution facilities. At present, the Company cannot predict the number of such claims that may be filed, and cannot reasonably estimate any loss or range of loss that may arise from these proceedings. The Company believes it has substantial factual and legal defenses to these claims, and intends to defend the claims vigorously. National Prescription Opiate Litigation and Related Matters In December 2017, the United States Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation consolidated numerous lawsuits filed against a wide array of defendants by various plaintiffs, including counties, cities, healthcare providers, Native American tribes, individuals, and third-party payors, asserting claims generally concerning the impacts of widespread opioid abuse. The consolidated multidistrict litigation is entitled In re National Prescription Opiate Litigation (MDL No. 2804) , and is pending in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Ohio. The Company is named as a defendant in some of the cases included in this multidistrict litigation. Similar cases that name the Company have also been filed in state courts by state, local and tribal governments, health care providers and other plaintiffs. Plaintiffs are seeking compensatory and punitive damages, as well as injunctive relief including abatement. The Company cannot predict the number of such claims that may be filed, but believes it has substantial factual and legal defenses to these claims, and intends to defend the claims vigorously. The Company has also been responding to subpoenas, information requests and investigations from governmental entities related to nationwide controlled substance dispensing and distribution practices involving opioids. The Company cannot reasonably estimate any loss or range of loss that may arise from these matters. Accordingly, the Company can provide no assurance as to the scope and outcome of these matters and no assurance as to whether its business, financial position, results of operations or cash flows will not be materially adversely affected. FCPA Investigation and Related Matters The Audit Committee (the \"Audit Committee\") of the Board of Directors of the Company has been conducting an internal investigation into, among other things, alleged violations of the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (\"FCPA\") and other alleged crimes or misconduct in connection with foreign subsidiaries, including Wal-Mart de Mxico, S.A.B. de C.V. (\"Walmex\"), and whether prior allegations of such violations and/or misconduct were appropriately handled by the Company. The Audit Committee and the Company have engaged outside counsel from a number of law firms and other advisors who are assisting in the on-going investigation of these matters. The Company has also been conducting a voluntary global review of its policies, practices and internal controls for anti-corruption compliance. The Company is engaged in strengthening its global anti-corruption compliance program through appropriate remedial anti-corruption measures. In November 2011, the Company voluntarily disclosed that investigative activity to the U.S. Department of Justice (the \"DOJ\") and the Securities and Exchange Commission (the \"SEC\"). Since the implementation of the global review and the enhanced anti-corruption compliance program, the Audit Committee and the Company have identified or been made aware of additional allegations regarding potential violations of the FCPA. When such allegations have been reported or identified, the Audit Committee and the Company, together with their third party advisors, have conducted inquiries and when warranted based on those inquiries, opened investigations. Inquiries or investigations regarding allegations of potential FCPA violations were commenced in a number of foreign markets where the Company operates or has operated, including, but not limited to, Brazil, China and India. As previously disclosed, the Company is under investigation by the DOJ and the SEC regarding possible violations of the FCPA. The Company has been cooperating with the agencies and discussions have been ongoing regarding the resolution of these matters. These discussions have progressed to a point that, in fiscal 2018, the Company reasonably estimated a probable loss and recorded an aggregate accrual of $283 million with respect to these matters (the \"Accrual\"). As the discussions are continuing, there can be no assurance as to the timing or the terms of the final resolution of these matters. A number of federal and local government agencies in Mexico also investigated these matters. Walmex cooperated with the Mexican governmental agencies that conducted these investigations. Furthermore, lawsuits relating to the matters under investigation were filed by several of the Company's shareholders against Walmart, certain current and former directors and former officers and certain of Walmex's former officers. These matters have been resolved or immaterial accruals have been made for proposed settlements. The Company could be exposed to a variety of negative consequences as a result of the matters noted above. There could be one or more enforcement actions in respect of the matters that are the subject of some or all of the on-going government investigations, and such actions, if brought, may result in judgments, settlements, fines, penalties, injunctions, cease and desist orders, debarment or other relief, criminal convictions and/or penalties and shareholder lawsuits may result in judgments against the Company and its current and former directors and officers named in those proceedings. The Company expects that there will be on-going media and governmental interest, including additional news articles from media publications on these matters, which could impact the perception among certain audiences of the Company's role as a corporate citizen. In addition, the Company has incurred and expects to continue to incur costs in responding to requests for information or subpoenas seeking documents, testimony and other information in connection with the government investigations, in defending the shareholder lawsuits, and in conducting the review and investigations. These costs will be expensed as incurred. For the fiscal years ended January 31, 2019 , 2018 and 2017 , the Company incurred the following third-party expenses in connection with the FCPA investigation and related matters: ##TABLE_START   Fiscal Years Ended January 31, (Amounts in millions)    Ongoing inquiries and investigations  $  $  $ Global compliance program and organizational enhancements    Total  $  $  $ ##TABLE_ENDThe Company does not presently believe that these matters, including the Accrual (and the payment of the Accrual at some point-in-time in the future), will have a material adverse effect on its business, financial position, results of operations or cash flows, although given the inherent uncertainties in such situations, the Company can provide no assurance that these matters will not be material to its business, financial position, results of operations or cash flows in the future. Note 11. Commitments Rentals (including amounts applicable to taxes, insurance, maintenance, other operating expenses and contingent rentals) under operating leases and other short-term rental arrangements were $3.0 billion , $2.9 billion and $2.6 billion in fiscal 2019 , 2018 and 2017 , respectively. Aggregate minimum annual rentals as of January 31, 2019 , under non-cancelable leases are as follows: ##TABLE_START (Amounts in millions)     Fiscal Year  Operating Leases (1)  Capital Lease and Financing Obligations  $ 1,856  $ 2021  1,655  2022  1,420  2023  1,233  2024  1,063  Thereafter  6,891  6,069 Total minimum rentals  $ 14,118  $ 9,896 Less estimated executory costs    Net minimum lease payments    9,873 Financing obligation noncash gains and other    2,278 Less imputed interest    (4,739 ) Present value of minimum lease payments    $ 7,412 ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (1) Represents minimum contractual obligation for non-cancelable leases with initial or remaining terms greater than 12 months as of January 31, 2019 . ##TABLE_END Certain of the Company's leases provide for the payment of contingent rentals based on a percentage of sales. Such contingent rentals were not material for fiscal 2019 , 2018 and 2017 . Substantially all of the Company's store leases have renewal options, some of which may trigger an escalation in rentals. Note 12. Retirement-Related Benefits The Company offers a 401(k) plan for associates in the U.S. under which eligible associates can begin contributing to the plan immediately upon hire. The Company also offers a 401(k) type plan for associates in Puerto Rico under which associates can begin to contribute generally after one year of employment. Under these plans, after one year of employment, the Company matches 100% of participant contributions up to 6% of annual eligible earnings. The matching contributions immediately vest at 100% for each associate. Participants can contribute up to 50% of their pretax earnings, but not more than the statutory limits. Associates in international countries who are not U.S. citizens are covered by various defined contribution post-employment benefit arrangements. These plans are administered based upon the legislative and tax requirements in the countries in which they are established. The following table summarizes the contribution expense related to the Company's defined contribution plans for fiscal 2019 , 2018 and 2017 : ##TABLE_START  Fiscal Years Ended January 31, (Amounts in millions)   Defined contribution plans:      U.S. $ 1,165  $ 1,124  $ 1,064 International   Total contribution expense for defined contribution plans $ 1,291  $ 1,250  $ 1,237 ##TABLE_ENDAdditionally, the Company's subsidiaries in the United Kingdom and Japan have sponsored defined benefit pension plans. The plan in the United Kingdom was overfunded by $326 million and $97 million  as of January 31, 2019 and 2018 , respectively. The plan in Japan was underfunded by $175 million and $184 million as of January 31, 2019 and 2018 , respectively. Overfunded amounts are recorded as assets in the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets in other assets and deferred charges. Underfunded amounts are recorded as liabilities in the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets in deferred income taxes and other. Certain other international operations also have defined benefit arrangements that are not significant. Note 13. Acquisitions, Disposals and Related Items The following significant transactions impact, or are expected to impact, the operations of the Company's Walmart International segment. Other immaterial transactions have also occurred or been announced. Walmart Brazil In August 2018, the Company sold an 80 percent stake of Walmart Brazil to Advent International (\"Advent\"). Under the terms, Advent agreed to contribute additional capital to the business over a three-year period and Walmart agreed to indemnify Advent for certain matters. Additionally, the Company may receive up to approximately $250 million in contingent consideration. The disposal group consisted of the following: ##TABLE_START  Assets of $3.3 billion , which were fully impaired as discussed in Note 7 upon meeting the held for sale criteria; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Liabilities of $1.3 billion , consisting of $0.7 billion in accounts payable and accrued liabilities, $0.1 billion of capital lease and financing obligations, and $0.5 billion of deferred taxes and other long-term liabilities; and ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Cumulative foreign currency translation loss of $2.0 billion , which was reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive loss (see Note 4 ). ##TABLE_END As a result, the Company recorded a pre-tax net loss of $4.8 billion  during during fiscal 2019 in other gains and losses in the Company's Consolidated Statement of Income . In calculating the loss, the fair value of the disposal group was reduced by $0.8 billion related to an indemnity, for which a liability was recognized upon closing and is recorded in deferred income taxes and other in the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets. Under the indemnity, the Company will indemnify Advent for certain pre-closing tax and legal contingencies and other matters for up to R$2.3 billion , adjusted for interest based on the Brazilian interbank deposit rate. The Company deconsolidated the financial statements of Walmart Brazil during the third quarter of fiscal 2019 and began accounting for its remaining 20 percent ownership interest, determined to have no initial fair value, using the equity method of accounting. Flipkart In August 2018, the Company acquired 81 percent of the outstanding shares, or 77 percent of the diluted shares, of Flipkart, an Indian-based eCommerce marketplace , for cash consideration of approximately $16 billion . The acquisition increases the Company's investment in India, a large, growing economy. The purchase price allocation, which is still preliminary primarily due to certain tax items, is as follows: ##TABLE_START  Assets of $24.1 billion , which comprise primarily of $2.2 billion in cash and cash equivalents, $2.8 billion in other current assets, $5.0 billion in intangible assets and $13.6 billion in goodwill. Of the intangible assets, $4.7 billion represents the fair value of trade names, each with an indefinite life, which were estimated using the income approach based on Level 3 unobservable inputs. The remaining $0.3 billion of intangible assets primarily relate to acquired technology with a life of 3 years . The goodwill arising from the acquisition consists largely of anticipated synergies and economies of scale primarily related to procurement and logistics and is not expected to be deductible for tax purposes; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Liabilities of $3.7 billion , which comprise primarily of $1.8 billion of current liabilities and $1.8 billion of deferred income taxes; and ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START  Noncontrolling interest of $4.3 billion , for which the fair value was estimated using the income approach based on Level 3 unobservable inputs. ##TABLE_ENDThe Company began consolidating the financial statements of Flipkart in the third quarter of fiscal 2019, using a one-month lag . To finance the acquisition, the Company used a combination of cash provided by long-term debt as discussed in Note 6 and cash on hand. The Flipkart results of operations since acquisition and the pro forma financial information are immaterial. Asda In April 2018, the Company entered into a definitive agreement and announced the proposed combination of J Sainsbury plc and Asda Group Limited (\"Asda Group\"), the Company's wholly owned UK retail subsidiary. Under the terms of the combination, the Company would receive approximately 42 percent of the share capital of the combined company. In addition, the Company would receive approximately 3 billion in cash, subject to customary closing adjustments, and retain obligations under the Asda Group defined benefit pension plan . Due to a complex regulatory review process, the outcome of which continues to be uncertain, the held for sale classification criteria for the disposal group was not met as of January 31, 2019 . If the transaction closes, the Company would deconsolidate the financial statements of Asda Group and account for the ongoing investment in the combined company using the equity method of accounting. Suburbia In April 2017, the Company sold Suburbia, the apparel retail division in Mexico, for $1.0 billion . As part of the sales agreement, the Company is also leasing certain real estate to the purchaser. The sale resulted in a pre-tax gain of $0.7 billion , of which $0.4 billion was recognized in the second quarter of fiscal 2018 in membership and other income, and the remainder was deferred and is being recognized over the lease terms of approximately 20 years . Yihaodian and JD In June 2016, the Company sold certain assets relating to Yihaodian, its eCommerce operations in China, including the Yihaodian brand, website and application, to JD in exchange for Class A ordinary shares of JD, valued at $1.5 billion , representing approximately five percent of JD's outstanding ordinary shares on a fully diluted basis. The sale resulted in the recognition of a $535 million noncash gain, which was included in membership and other income in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Income. Subsequently, during fiscal 2017, the Company purchased $1.9 billion of additional JD shares, representing an incremental ownership percentage of approximately five percent , for a total ownership of approximately ten percent of JD's outstanding ordinary shares. The following significant transaction primarily impacts the Company's Walmart U.S. segment. Other immaterial transactions have also occurred or been announced. Jet.com, Inc. In September 2016, the Company completed the acquisition of jet.com, a U.S.-based eCommerce company. The integration of jet.com into the Walmart U.S. segment is building upon the current eCommerce foundation, allowing for synergies from talent, logistical operations and access to a broader customer base. The total purchase price for the acquisition was $2.4 billion , net of cash acquired. The allocation of the purchase price includes $1.7 billion in goodwill and $0.6 billion in intangible assets. As part of the transaction, the Company is paying additional compensation of approximately $0.8 billion over a five year period. Note 14. Restructuring Charges In fiscal 2018, the Company announced several organizational changes to position the business for more efficient growth going forward. As a result, the Company recorded $1.2 billion in pre-tax restructuring charges in fiscal 2018 as follows: ##TABLE_START   Fiscal Year Ended January 31, 2018 (Amounts in millions)  Asset Impairment  Severance Costs  Total Walmart International    Sam's Club    Corporate and support     Total  $  $  $ 1,201 ##TABLE_ENDThe asset impairment charges primarily relate to the real estate of the Sam's Club closures and the wind-down of the Brazil first-party eCommerce business, which were written down to their estimated fair value. Refer to Note 7 for information on the fair value measurement. The pre-tax restructuring charges of $1.2 billion are classified in operating, selling, general and administrative expenses in the Company's Consolidated Statement of Income for fiscal 2018. As of January 31, 2018, substantially all of the severance costs were recorded in accrued liabilities in the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets and were subsequently paid during fiscal 2019. Note 15. Segments and Disaggregated Revenue Segments The Company is engaged in the operation of retail, wholesale and other units, as well as eCommerce websites, located throughout the U.S., Africa, Argentina, Canada, Central America, Chile, China, India, Japan, Mexico and the United Kingdom, as well as Brazil prior to the sale of the majority stake of Walmart Brazil discussed in Note 13 . The Company's operations are conducted in three reportable segments: Walmart U.S., Walmart International and Sam's Club. The Company defines its segments as those operations whose results the chief operating decision maker (\"CODM\") regularly reviews to analyze performance and allocate resources. The Company sells similar individual products and services in each of its segments. It is impractical to segregate and identify revenues for each of these individual products and services. The Walmart U.S. segment includes the Company's mass merchant concept in the U.S., as well as eCommerce and omni-channel initiatives. The Walmart International segment consists of the Company's operations outside of the U.S., as well as eCommerce and omni-channel initiatives. The Sam's Club segment includes the warehouse membership clubs in the U.S., as well as samsclub.com and omni-channel initiatives. Corporate and support consists of corporate overhead and other items not allocated to any of the Company's segments. The Company measures the results of its segments using, among other measures, each segment's net sales and operating income, which includes certain corporate overhead allocations. From time to time, the Company revises the measurement of each segment's operating income, including any corporate overhead allocations, as determined by the information regularly reviewed by its CODM. In fiscal 2019, the Company revised certain of its corporate overhead allocations, including depreciation expense, to the operating segments and, accordingly, revised prior period amounts for comparability . Information for the Company's segments, as well as for Corporate and support, including the reconciliation to income before income taxes, is provided in the following table: ##TABLE_START (Amounts in millions)  Walmart U.S.  Walmart International  Sam's Club  Corporate and support  Consolidated Fiscal Year Ended January 31, 2019           Net sales  $ 331,666  $ 120,824  $ 57,839  $   $ 510,329 Operating income (loss)  17,386  4,883  1,520  (1,832 )  21,957 Interest, net      (2,129 ) Other gains and (losses)      (8,368 ) Income before income taxes      $ 11,460 Total assets  $ 105,114  $ 97,066  $ 12,893  $ 4,222  $ 219,295 Depreciation and amortization  6,201  2,590   1,248  10,678 Capital expenditures  6,034  2,661   1,199  10,344       Fiscal Year Ended January 31, 2018      Net sales  $ 318,477  $ 118,068  $ 59,216  $   $ 495,761 Operating income (loss)  16,995  5,229   (2,702 )  20,437 Interest, net      (2,178 ) Loss on extinguishment of debt      (3,136 ) Income before income taxes      $ 15,123 Total assets  $ 104,347  $ 81,549  $ 13,418  $ 5,208  $ 204,522 Depreciation and amortization  6,005  2,601   1,225  10,529 Capital expenditures  5,680  2,607   1,138  10,051       Fiscal Year Ended January 31, 2017      Net sales  $ 307,833  $ 116,119  $ 57,365  $   $ 481,317 Operating income (loss)  17,012  5,737  1,628  (1,613 )  22,764 Interest, net      (2,267 ) Income before income taxes      $ 20,497 Total assets  $ 104,262  $ 74,508  $ 14,125  $ 5,930  $ 198,825 Depreciation and amortization  5,598  2,629   1,141  10,080 Capital expenditures  6,090  2,697   1,193  10,619 ##TABLE_ENDTotal revenues, consisting of net sales and membership and other income, and long-lived assets, consisting primarily of property and equipment, net, aggregated by the Company's U.S. and non-U.S. operations for fiscal 2019 , 2018 and 2017 , are as follows: ##TABLE_START  Fiscal Years Ended January 31, (Amounts in millions)   Revenues      U.S. operations $ 392,265  $ 380,580  $ 367,784 Non-U.S. operations 122,140  119,763  118,089 Total revenues $ 514,405  $ 500,343  $ 485,873       Long-lived assets      U.S. operations $ 81,144  $ 81,478  $ 82,746 Non-U.S. operations 30,251  33,340  31,432 Total long-lived assets $ 111,395  $ 114,818  $ 114,178 ##TABLE_ENDNo individual country outside of the U.S. had total revenues or long-lived assets that were material to the consolidated totals.

CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES ##TABLE_ENDGeneral Management is responsible for the preparation, integrity and objectivity of Walmart Inc.'s Consolidated Financial Statements and other financial information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Those Consolidated Financial Statements were prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. In preparing those Consolidated Financial Statements, management is required to make certain estimates and judgments, which are based upon currently available information and management's view of current conditions and circumstances. The Audit Committee of the Board of Directors oversees our process of reporting financial information and the audit of our Consolidated Financial Statements. The Audit Committee stays informed of the financial condition of Walmart Inc. and regularly reviews management's financial policies and procedures, the independence of our independent auditors, our internal control over financial reporting and the objectivity of our financial reporting. Both the independent auditors and the internal auditors have free access to the Audit Committee and meet with the Audit Committee regularly, both with and without management present. Acting through our Audit Committee, we have retained Ernst  Young LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, to audit our Consolidated Financial Statements appearing in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. We have made available to Ernst  Young LLP all of our financial records and related data in connection with their audit of our Consolidated Financial Statements. We have filed with the SEC the required certifications related to our Consolidated Financial Statements as of and for the year ended January 31, 2019 . These certifications are attached as exhibits to this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Additionally, we have also provided to the New York Stock Exchange the required annual certification of our Chief Executive Officer regarding our compliance with the New York Stock Exchange's corporate governance listing standards. Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures We maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to provide reasonable assurance that information, which is required to be timely disclosed, is accumulated and communicated to management in a timely fashion. In designing and evaluating such controls and procedures, we recognize that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. Our management is necessarily required to use judgment in evaluating controls and procedures. Also, we have investments in unconsolidated entities. Since we do not control or manage those entities, our controls and procedures with respect to those entities are substantially more limited than those we maintain with respect to our consolidated subsidiaries. In the ordinary course of business, we review our internal control over financial reporting and make changes to our systems and processes to improve such controls and increase efficiency, while ensuring that we maintain an effective internal control environment. Changes may include such activities as implementing new, more efficient systems, updating existing systems, automating manual processes, standardizing controls globally, migrating certain processes to our shared services organizations and increasing monitoring controls. During fiscal 2019, we announced an agreement to outsource select accounting transaction-processing activities which is part of an ongoing initiative to enhance our shared service model. These changes have not materially affected, and are not reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company's internal control over financial reporting. However, they allow us to continue to enhance our internal control over financial reporting and ensure that our internal control environment remains effective. An evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report was performed under the supervision and with the participation of management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer. Based upon that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are effective to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files or submits under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, is accumulated and communicated to management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure and are effective to provide reasonable assurance that such information is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified by the SEC's rules and forms. Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting Management has responsibility for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external reporting purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Management has assessed the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of January 31, 2019 . In making its assessment, management has utilized the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations (\"COSO\") of the Treadway Commission in Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013). Management concluded that based on its assessment, Walmart's internal control over financial reporting was effective as of January 31, 2019 . The Company's internal control over financial reporting as of January 31, 2019 , has been audited by Ernst  Young LLP as stated in their report which appears herein. Under guidelines established by the SEC, companies are allowed to exclude acquisitions from their first assessment of internal control over financial reporting following the date of acquisition. Based on those guidelines, management's assessment of the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting excluded Flipkart Private Limited (\"Flipkart\"), which the Company acquired in fiscal 2019, except for the recognition of goodwill and intangible assets that were included in management's assessment. Flipkart represented approximately 2% of the Companys total assets as of January 31, 2019, after excluding goodwill and intangible assets recorded, and approximately 1% of the Companys net sales for the year ended January 31, 2019. The Company's acquisition of Flipkart is discussed in Note 13 to its Consolidated Financial Statements for fiscal 2019. Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting There has been no change in the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of January 31, 2019 , that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company's internal control over financial reporting. Report on Ethical Standards Our Company was founded on the belief that open communication and the highest ethical standards are necessary to be successful. Our long-standing \"Open Door\" communication policy helps management be aware of and address issues in a timely and effective manner. Through the open door policy all associates are encouraged to inform management at the appropriate level when they are concerned about any matter pertaining to Walmart. Walmart has adopted a Statement of Ethics to guide our associates in the continued observance of high ethical standards such as honesty, integrity and compliance with the law in the conduct of Walmart's business. Familiarity and compliance with the Statement of Ethics is required of all associates. The Company also maintains a separate Code of Ethics for our senior financial officers. Walmart also has in place a Related-Party Transaction Policy. This policy applies to Walmart's senior officers and directors and requires material related-party transactions to be reviewed by the Audit Committee. The senior officers and directors are required to report material related-party transactions to Walmart. We maintain a global ethics and compliance office which oversees and administers several reporting mechanisms, including an ethics helpline. The ethics helpline provides a channel for associates to ask questions and make confidential complaints regarding potential violations of our statements of ethics, including violations related to financial or accounting matters. These contacts may be made anonymously. ##TABLE_START  /s/ C. Douglas McMillon C. Douglas McMillon President and Chief Executive Officer  /s/ M. Brett Biggs M.
